["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "After some Ohio voters - including many in Cuyahoga County - faced\u00a0hours-long voting lines\u00a0during the 2004 presidential election, the state adopted reforms intended to prevent future backups, such as allowing extended time before elections for voters to cast in-person ballots at county elections boards.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 voter mobilization effort made particular use of voting the Sunday before elections, as African-American churches organized \"Souls to the Polls\" events which brought worshippers to vote after religious services.\n\nSince then, Ohio\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature and GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted have cited budgetary concerns in making several efforts to reduce in-person early voting hours, engendering an uproar that included a federal lawsuit.\n\nOn August 31, a federal judge ordered\u00a0restoration of in-person early voting for the three days before election day, but Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine filed an appeal. Rep. Marcia Fudge and other Democrats have maintained\u00a0Republicans want to eliminate that weekend\u2019s early voting to cut turnout among African-Americans -- a claim Republicans deny.\n\nBut in a recent news release\u00a0from Fudge and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Fudge spoke to how much minority voters relied on early voting.\n\n\"It\u2019s troubling that by eliminating weekend voting hours, the state of Ohio specifically banned a popular voting time of choice for minorities,\" Fudge said. \"In Cuyahoga County, which I represent, 56 percent of weekend voters in 2008 were African American while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio thought Fudge\u2019s data on African American use of in-person early voting warranted a closer look. Cuyahoga County, home to Cleveland and Fudge\u2019s hometown of Warrensville Heights, is the most populous and had the largest voting population among Ohio counties in 2008.\n\nWe asked Fudge\u2019s office where she got her statistics. Her staff referred us to a research study on early voting\u00a0by Case Western Reserve University emeritus professor Norman Robbins, and Cleveland State University urban affairs professor Mark Salling.\n\nTheir study estimates that 56.4 percent of Cuyahoga county\u2019s 2008 early-in-person voters were black. Of those who voted on election day or by mail, 25.7 percent of them were black. And specifically, the study found that on the four weekends prior to election day, 56 percent of the ballots were cast by black voters.\n\nWhite voters showed the reverse pattern, it said. They comprised 40 percent of early-in-person votes and 69.4 percent of those who voted on election day or by mail.\n\nThe study said that 15.6 percent of all votes cast by African Americans in Cuyahoga County were through early-in-person voting, compared with 4.5 percent of votes by whites.\n\nThe study also said that 28 percent of Cuyahoga county adults 18 and over are African American, as are 24 percent of voting age adults in Hamilton County (Cincinnati), and 20 percent each in Franklin (Columbus) and Montgomery (Dayton) counties.\n\n\"We conclude that in Cuyahoga County, and quite probably in other counties with substantial black populations, elimination of ANY EIP (early-in-person) voting period clearly disproportionately affects African Americans in an election similar to 2008,\" the study said.\n\nIn an email to PolitiFact Ohio, study co-author Robbins observed that African-American turnout was \"disproportionately high and approximately the same, ranging from about 54 to 59 percent\" during every early voting time period - business hours, extended weekday hours, weekends, or the last three days before the election.\n\nOn the final weekend before election day, Robbins said, 58.9 percent of early in-person voters in Cuyahoga county were African-American. During the four weekends before that, he said 56.3 percent of voters were African-American.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio queried Cuyahoga County Election Board Director Jane Platten about the study\u2019s statistics. She said she couldn\u2019t evaluate its racial voting numbers because the county doesn\u2019t collect data on the voters\u2019 ethnicity. She said \"a lot\" of African Americans made use of the county\u2019s early-in-person voting program, although she said she had \"no idea\" of the percentage.\n\nSo how did the authors come up with their racial data? Although the county doesn\u2019t track voters\u2019 race, voter addresses are on file. The study\u2019s authors used those addresses to determine the census block where voters reside, and extrapolated their race by using \u00a02010 census data on each block\u2019s racial makeup. For example, if a voter\u2019s address was in a census block in which 75 percent of the population was black and 25 percent was white, that voter was considered to have a 75 percent probability of being black.\n\nSeveral independent demographics experts told PolitiFact Ohio this method would provide valid racial voting data.\n\n\"I can\u2019t think of a better way to do it, and I don\u2019t think there would be any big errors in that method,\" said Carl Schmertmann, a Florida State University demography professor who formerly served on the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s scientific advisory committee.\n\n\"The logic by which the authors attempt to estimate the race of early voters makes sense,\" agreed Scott Keeter, the Pew Research Center\u2019s survey research director.\n\nKeeter noted that 2008 exit polling data in Ohio found that 16 percent of those who voted early - either by mail or in-person - were black voters, while 9 percent of in-person voters were black.\n\n\"African-Americans statewide do appear to have made heavier use of early voting, but the exit poll did not ask how a vote was cast, so we can\u2019t be sure that this pattern is mostly a result of EIP voting,\" said an email from Keeter.\n\nRobbins research, though, was able to break out the EIP population.\n\nFudge drew her statistics, which she cited accurately, from a research study that stated that 56 percent of the 2008 Cuyahoga county voters voted who cast ballots on weekends before the election were African American and that 28 percent of the county\u2019s voting age population is African American.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Fudge\u2019s claim rates True.", "PolitiFact Florida,\u2018Souls to the Polls,\u2019 Sunday drew high numbers of African-Americans and Hispanics, Corrine Brown says, June 22, 2012\n\nUSA Today,Long lines on Election Day enhance appeal of early voting, Nov. 17, 2004\n\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com, \"New state voting laws cause controversy; critics fear turnout will suffer,\" August 5, 2012.\n\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com,\"Ohio House votes to repeal controversial election law,\" May 8, 2012\n\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com, \"Judge overturns Ohio law, restores in-person early voting in 3 days leading to Election Day,\" August 31, 2012\n\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com, \"Ohio attorney general says he will appeal ruling that restores in-person early voting on eve of Election Day,\" August 31, 2012\n\nPress release, Conyers and Fudge Call for Investigation of Potential Voter Suppression in Ohio, August 24, 2012\n\nThe Plain Dealer,Obama campaign sues Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted over early voting restrictions,July 17, 2012\n\nSen.
