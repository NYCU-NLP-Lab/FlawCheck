["About this rating", "The Prohibition era lasted little more than a decade \u2014 from 1920 to 1933 \u2014\u00a0but its effects stretched far beyond those years. \u00a0Speakeasies and saloons are still lionized by historical fetishists, and slang from that era is still in American English today.", "One popular story about Prohibition is that the\u00a0cocktail (using both the general definition of a \"mixed drink\" and the specific one of spirits, bitters, and sugar)\u00a0emerged as a wholly American invention, straight\u00a0from the alcohol ban. The popular mixed drinks, or so the story goes, were created to dilute or mask the pungent (if not outright nasty) taste of moonshine or bathtub brew:", "Where beer and wine had previously been the drinks of choice, now alcohol was drank much more frequently, as it was easier to transport and took up less space, making it cheaper for speakeasy patrons. It was at this time that the \"cocktail\u201d was born, which had virtually been non-existent prior to Prohibition....", "This sounds plausible,\u00a0bolstered by a mixology\u00a0recipe book a bit later in the century, penned by a bartender named \"Professor\" Jerry Thomas and advancing the claim that cocktails came straight from the States.", "But human nature being what it is, how plausible is it that humanity has been consuming fermented drinks for thousands of years and only stumbled onto cocktails in the past few hundred? \u00a0As it turns out, not very. \u00a0Despite \"Professor\" Thomas's valuable contributions to cocktail culture, not even the word is American: the first time the word can be found in print (at least where the drinks are concerned) is in 1798\u00a0\u2014 in a London newspaper. \u00a0(Thomas worked in London before returning to the United States.)", "So Americans didn't invent the cocktail, after all. \u00a0But they did help popularize it\u00a0\u2014 just not during Prohibition. \u00a0Mixed drinks actually showed up long before the 1920s; they were already well known in colonial times, an era in which alcohol was consumed routinely and enthusiastically. \u00a0A 1991 article\u00a0in the Organization of American Historians Magazine of History has alcohol consumption in the late 1700s at about three and a half gallons per person a year, or\u00a0double today's rates:", "By 1770 Americans consumed alcohol regularly with every meal. Many people began the day with an \"eye-opener\" and closed it with a nightcap. People of all ages drank, including toddlers who finished off the heavily sugared portion at the bottom of a parent's mug of rum toddy.", "That alcohol was often in the form of various mixed drinks, but they didn't officially evolve into the cocktail (officially, a mixture of \"aromatic bitters\" mixed into spirit with water and a dash of sugar) until a bit later. \u00a0Bitters, which are highly concentrated plant extracts, were used medicinally for centuries, but became\u00a0famous\u00a0in the 1800s in\u00a0Venezuela (home of Angostura)\u00a0when they were used to treat Simon Bolivar's army. As bitters were often taken with spirits and sugar to make them more palatable, they quickly went from\u00a0medicinal\u00a0to recreational use.", "Back in the United States, the rate of alcohol consumption was rising quickly. Historian W.J. Rorabaugh writes that\u00a0by the 1830s, the average person drank around\u00a0four\u00a0gallons\u00a0of alcoholic beverages\u00a0per year:", "...after\u00a01800, as the quantity of spirits consumed increased, the total quantity of alcohol consumed from all sources until it reached a peak of nearly 4 gallons per capita in 1830. This rate of consumption was the highest in the annals\u00a0of the\u00a0United States.\u00a0\u00a0After reaching this peak, consumption fell sharply under the influence of the temperance movement, and since 1840 its highest levels have been under 2 gallons\u00a0\u2014 less than half the rate of consumption in the 1820s.", "According to\u00a0cocktail historian David Wondrich, bitters were an easy addition to the ferment, with the added bonus of being medicinal (early advertising sold bitters as hangover cures).\u00a0 It was an addition to which both Europeans and Americans\u00a0took enthusiastically:", "In any case, by the middle of the 1700s, gin and bitters, brandy and bitters, and wine and bitters all appear frequently on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, in May 1783, when British officers were meeting with George Washington and his staff to arrange the British surrender of New York, \u201cWashington pulled out his watch,\u201d as the Loyalist William Smith recorded in his diary, \u201cand observing that it was near Dinner Time, offered Wine and Bitters.\u201d With this we should bear in mind the New Orleans Daily Picayune's 1844 observation that \u201calthough the term of \u2018wine-and-bitters\u2019 be in appearance specific, it is indeed one of the most generic which the wealth of the English language furnishes,\u201d and it is easily comprehended as the cocktail itself. Was the Father of His Country the host of the first cocktail hour on record? It's possible.", "Alcohol use\u00a0continued to grow until Prohibition cut it, but not by as much as temperance\u00a0proponents thought it might. Speakeasies quickly sprang up like mushrooms after a rain; a thriving black market brought in beer, wine, and liquor; and everyone knew someone with a still somewhere.", "But speakeasies, where the threat of raids loomed every moment, weren't a place to nurse your elegant and sophisticated mixed drink, no matter what you might have heard. \u00a0They were instead a place to bolt down alcoholic drinks as quickly as possible, writes Wondrich:", "So if you desire a real speakeasy tipple, you can have either a glass of Champagne or a whiskey-and-ginger-ale highball. That\u2019s about it. All that talk of the fabulous cocktails made in the midst of Prohibition in order to mask the flavors of badly made alcohol is wrong. When your drinking experience is an illegal one, you just want to get down to drinking.", "After Prohibition ended, \"Americans didn't know a damn thing about drinking,\"\u00a0Esquire\u00a0lamented. (The magazine was launched in 1933, the same year Prohibition was repealed.) \u00a0The elegant tastes of medicinal bitters and delicately mixed drinks were all but forgotten:", "Fourteen years of adulterate alcohol and literally criminal bartenders had turned us into a nation of indiscriminate liquor swillers, people who thought the right wine for filet of sole was gin and orange juice.", "So clearly, cocktail culture had to be built up again from scratch. Luckily, the Old World\u00a0had never even considered an alcohol ban and so the recipes were there, waiting to return to the United States, once Prohibition was repealed.", "And what of the word \"cocktail?\" How did a drink that began as a hangover cure and medicinal morning pick-me-up get its name? \u00a0Its history is murky and its etymology difficult to pin down, but cocktail historian David Wondrich says he thinks his theory is \"pretty solid\":", "I actually know where \"cocktail\" came from, pretty solidly. It's in the book. Ginger was used in the horse trade to make a horse stick its tail up. They'd put it in its ass. If you had an old horse you were trying to sell, you would put some ginger up its butt, and it would cock its tail up and be frisky. That was known as \u201ccock-tail.\u201d It comes from that. It became this morning thing. Something to cock your tail up, like an eye-opener. I\u2019m almost positive that\u2019s where it\u2019s from.", "Brown, Jared. \u00a0\u00a0\"The Surprising History of the Cocktail.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Telegraph. \u00a0 13 December 2012.", "Rorabaugh, W.J. \u00a0 \"The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Oxford University Press. \u00a0 \u00a01979.", "Rorabaugh, W.J. \u00a0 \"Alcohol in America.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 OAH Magazine of History. \u00a0 \u00a0Fall 1991.", "Sherwood, Alison. \u00a0 \"What Are Bitters and How Are They Used in Cocktails?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Journal Sentinel. \u00a0 \u00a018 March 2014.", "Smith, Peter. \u00a0 \"A Brief History of Bitters.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Smithsonian.com. \u00a0 \u00a020 March 2012.", "Thomas, Jerry. \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Bartender's Guide: How to Mix Drinks or the Bon Vivant's Companion: 1862 Edition\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Createspace Independendent Publishing Platform. \u00a0 \u00a02010.", "Wondrich, David. \u00a0 \"Imbibe!: From Absinthe Cocktail to Whiskey Smash, a Salute in Stories and Drinks to \"Professor\" Jerry Thomas, Pioneer of the American Bar Featuring the Original Formulae.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Penguin Group. \u00a0 \u00a02007, 2015.", "Brooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
