["In a historic shift to the left, Arizona backed Democratic\u00a0challenger\u00a0Joe Biden for president, making his win a target for conspiracy theories on social media.", "The\u00a0controversy \"SharpieGate\" gained national attention after a\u00a0video\u00a0went viral of a woman\u00a0claiming\u00a0she witnessed\u00a0poll workers\u00a0deliberately handing out Sharpies at polling locations to invalidate\u00a0votes.", "\"Arizona\u00a0Secretary of State threw out my vote for Trump Bc I voted with a sharpie!

The county's new tabulation machines, which were tested many times, will count votes cast with these types of pens.", "Maricopa County also explained in a Twitter video that the new tabulation machine only reads the ovals, so bleed-throughs are not a problem\u00a0and that the new ballot style has off-centered columns, so bleed-throughs won't impact counting.", "The county said it preferred Sharpies at voting\u00a0centers because they dry much quicker, while ballpoint ink can smudge onto optical readers or other ballots which can create issues.", "A Maricopa County sheriff's deputy was sent to investigate a polling place in Queen Creek on Tuesday and found that a woman was handing voters ballpoint pens with a flyer urging them not to use Sharpies.

An election worker will fill out a new ballot using the voter's\u00a0choices that will be read properly by tabulation machines.", "The manual states that the process is overseen by a Ballot Duplication Board comprised of at least two members of different political parties.", "\"The Ballot Duplication Board duplicates ballots that cannot be read by the tabulation machine but on which the voter has nonetheless clearly indicated their intent to vote on a particular race or ballot measure,\" the 2019 manual states.", "\"This may include crumpled or otherwise damaged ballots, ballots with smudged ink, or ballots which are marked in the wrong color of ink or with a device that cannot be read by the tabulation machine. If voter intent is not clear and Ballot Duplication Board members do not agree on the voter intent for a particular ballot, that ballot should be referred to the Snag Board or officer in charge of elections for resolution prior to duplicating the ballot.\"", "Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs\u00a0told Fox 10 that ballots marked with Sharpie pens would be counted.", "\"A\u00a0trained, employed polling place worker is not going to give you a pen to mark your ballot that is going to invalidate your ballot,\" Hobbs said.", "Hobbs also took to Twitter to clarify that voters who received an early ballot but chose to vote in-person instead will see their early ballot status as \"Canceled\" on their ballot status update.
