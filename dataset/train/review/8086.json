It also points to thousands of photos taken by the Chinese Yutu moon rover, which launched in December 2013 and ceased to operate in July 2016, stating these \"showed no trace\" of the Apollo moon landing.", "While the rover did take many photos, Andrew Jones, a journalist following China\u2019s space program, points out that Yutu landed far from the Apollo landing site, so there wouldn\u2019t be evidence one way or another.", "\"It had traveled tens of meters in total, when it would have needed to travel thousands of kilometers over varying and hazardous terrain to visit all the Apollo landing sites,\" Jones said. \"Yutu, with designed minimum lifetime of three (Earth) months and a range of up to 10 kilometers, lasted 31 months on the Moon, but was stationary for the vast majority of this.\"", "The Lunar Reconnaissance Spacecraft has captured ample evidence of the Apollo landing, though, which can be seen in this database. This is the same spacecraft that the Chinese space agency used to determine Yutu\u2019s landing site.", "In addition to photographs, the Apollo mission brought back rock samples that have fueled decades of scientific research, and are available upon request from NASA.", "\"So far, no one has seen those samples and declared them to be fake,\" director of space policy at Planetary Society Casey Dreier said.", "The story also claims the Chinese space program launched a petition demanding the United States declassify NASA information regarding the U.S. moon landing, signed by 200 of its highest-ranking officials.", "But the petition is nowhere to be found and alleged signee and \"world renowned nuclear engineer\" Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin is actually renowned in fake news circles as a Russian conspiracy theorist denying all moon landings. The only information available about him online, though, has been produced by Mukhin\u00a0himself, leading Wikipedia to cast serious doubt on his profile.", "The story can be traced back to a 2014 post on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake news that assumes \"all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\"", "We rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "AntiNewsNetwork.in, \"Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings!\" May 21, 2017.", "WorldNewsDailyReport.com, \"Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings,\" Sept. 25, 2014.", "Phone interview with Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the Planetary Society, June 21, 2017.", "Email interview with Andrew Jones, a journalist covering China\u2019s space program for gbtimes.com and contributor to Planetary.org, June 21, 2017.", "NASA, \"Apollo landing sites revisited,\" Sept. 30, 2013.", "Popular Science, \"After 40 years, new results from the moon\u2019s surface,\" Dec. 22, 2015.", "Planetary.org, \"Chang\u2019e 3 data: Rover Panoramic Camera (PCAM),\" Jan. 28, 2016.", "Nature Communications, \"Correlated compositional and mineralogical investigations at the Chang\u2019e 3 landing site,\" Dec. 22, 2015.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
