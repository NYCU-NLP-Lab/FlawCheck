["Former President Pranab Mukherjee will be addressing RSS cadres at an event in Nagpur on June 7. Mukherjee\u2019s acceptance of the invitation has taken many by surprise. While there are those who are alarmed by Mukherjee\u2019s nod to the RSS, others contend that dialogue is an intrinsic part of democracy and there is nothing inherently objectionable about the move. In this context, it has been observed that a number of quotations attributed to Mukherjee have been circulating on social media in the last few months and particularly in the last few days. This trend had started not long after Mukherjee released his autobiography The Coalition Years in October 2017.", "Alt News discovered at least three dubious quotations ascribed to Mukherjee which have circulated widely on social media.
