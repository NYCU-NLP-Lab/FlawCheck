Radtke, a Tea Party activist who is seeking next year\u2019s GOP Senate nomination, called Webb\u2019s retirement \"a great opportunity to change the direction of our country.\"\n\n\"Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid and their ruinous agenda,\" Radtke said in a written statement released on Feb. 11, the day Webb made announcement.\n\nWebb, a former Republican turned Democrat, has always had a reputation for charting his own course. We wondered how much he was in sync with Obama and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is Senate majority leader.\n\nWe turned to the voting records.\n\nAccording to data compiled by non-partisan OpenCongress, Webb and Reid have voted together 1,325 times since Jan. 2007, when Webb joined the Senate. They have a \"voting similarity\" of 85 percent, according to the web site. Democratic senators average an 89 percent voting similarity.\n\nThe Washington Post also maintains an exhaustive congressional database. It shows Webb voted with a majority of Democratic senators 87 percent of the time during last Congress from 2009-11. Reid, during the same span, voted with his party 95 percent of the time.\n\nThe Post\u2019s review of the 111th Congress includes 689 votes.

In the 111th Congress only five other senators went against the party\u2019s majority more often than Webb did. But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us.", "But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us.
