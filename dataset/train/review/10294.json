["Elected officials\u2019 pay can be a sensitive topic with taxpayers, especially in today\u2019s economic climate. So it\u2019s no surprise Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce, who is running in November to keep his job, is bragging about cutting his salary.\n\nBoyce talked about his six-figure earnings in a YouTube video released by his office. Presented as a preview of the office\u2019s forthcoming annual financial report, the production feels more like a tribute to Boyce\u2019s performance as treasurer aimed directly at voters.\n\n\"I\u2019ve even cut my salary -- twice,\" said Boyce, a Democrat and former Columbus city councilman.\n\nBoyce was appointed Treasurer in late 2008. Richard Cordray left a vacancy when he took the state attorney general\u2019s job in the wake of Marc Dann\u2019s resignation.\n\nAnnual salaries for the state\u2019s elected officials are set in state law, which lawmakers can amend to increase or decrease pay. The treasurer\u2019s salary has been set at $109,986 since 2008.\n\nIn June 2009, Boyce sent a memo to the state Department of Administrative Services saying he was taking a pay cut that would reduce his gross salary that year to $107,874. The pay cut, effective July 1, 2009, was the equivalent of taking five unpaid furlough days, a cost-saving measure that has been forced upon many state employees.\n\nIn the same memo, Boyce authorized an extension of the reduction for all of 2010. This year\u2019s pay cut is the equivalent of 10 unpaid furlough days, according to the administrative services department.\n\nBoyce\u2019s gross salary this year will be $105,757.\n\nBoyce lumped both cuts -- each about 2 percent -- in the same memo, but he effectively trimmed his salary twice. Had he not extended the cut into 2010, his pay would\u2019ve jumped back up to $109,986, a spokeswoman for the administrative services department said.\n\nWe find Boyce\u2019s statement True.", "Comment on this item.", "YouTube, Boyce Uses Innovation to Reveal Fiscal Year End Accomplishments for Ohioans, posted July 14, 2010\n\nKevin Boyce, letter to the Ohio Department of Administrative Services, June, 26, 2009", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
