The photograph purportedly showing Obama with Weinstein, for instance, originally featured an image of Vice President Joe Biden:", "Obama surprised Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in January 2017.", "The image purportedly showing Obama with Anthony Weiner was created using an image that originally featured actor Tom Hanks:", "Hanks received his award in November 2016.", "The image of Bill Cosby was also fake.
