["About this rating", "On 22 October 2015,\u00a0the web site Now8News published an article reporting that a woman was arrested at a Louisiana WalMart for masturbating in a restroom with a Jimmy Dean sausage:", "Police are calling this a crime of the unthinkable, something that most people would never imagine\u00a0doing. On Monday, police were called to a Louisiana Walmart under the suspicion that a customer was shoplifting food. According to the complaint, a Walmart worker radioed security about a suspicious woman in the meat aisle. Security cameras filmed 33-year-old Shaniqua\u00a0Johnson\u00a0shoving sausages under her shirt.\u00a0CCTV footage then shows the woman walking to the bathroom, where she remained for at least 30 minutes.", "The male security guard says he knocked on the bathroom door several times but the woman did not respond. He then announced he was entering. What he found behind the door of the unlocked stall is something he said will \u201chaunt his dreams forever.\u201d The security guard reports when he entered the stall, Johnson was inappropriately pleasing herself with a Jimmy Dean package of sausage. He said\u00a0that when he entered \u201cShe didn\u2019t even stop. She just stared at me and kept going.\u201d", "A day after the\u00a0Now8News article\u00a0was published, the disreputable\u00a0Prntly web site regurgitated the story using\u00a0the same premise and photograph but changing several details, stating that the\u00a0incident occurred in New York not Louisiana, that the phallic food was a\u00a0Johnsonville Brand Sausage and not a Jimmy Dean sausage, and that the store involved was a Price Chopper and not a WalMart.\u00a0Why the\u00a0discrepancy? It might have something to do with the fact that both stories were\u00a0completely made up.", "Now8News is a fake news site camouflaged as a local television news outlet that publishes nothing but fictitious clickbait articles. Now8News has previously posted made-up stories about a woman being arrested for \"trying on\" tampons, an obese woman starving her children, and a man being arrested for having sex with a pig.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
