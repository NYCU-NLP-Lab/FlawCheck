["About this rating", "Attempting to assign any kind of status to this 2007 collection of purported quotes by Hillary Rodham Clinton poses something of a problem.  All of them have appeared in print as things the former first lady and current U.S. senator from New York supposedly said (although some of them are missourced in the example reproduced above), but they are stripped of explanatory context (and/or accompanied by misleading explanations), and they range from scripted public statements to spontaneous private utterances, from reports by mainstream journalists to revelations by unnamed or anonymous sources to mere hearsay repetition of rumor.", "We have attempted to trace each entry back to its first print source, provide a reasonably full context for the given quote, and note where the print source came by its information:", "While this quote is included in more than one book about the Clintons, its original source was a January 1994 American Spectator article by David Brock, who interviewed four state troopers who had worked for the Clintons while Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas.  The quote was taken from information provided by Arkansas state trooper Larry Patterson:", "The troopers were also objects of Hillary's wrath. Patterson recalled the early morning of Labor Day in 1991, when Hillary came out of the mansion, got in her car, and drove off. Within a minute or so of leaving the gate, her aging blue Cutlass swung violently around and came charging back onto the grounds, tires squealing in the dust. \"I thought something was terribly wrong, so I rushed out to her. And she screamed, 'Where is the goddamn f -- -ing flag?' It was early and we hadn't raised the flag yet. And she said, 'I want the goddamn f -- -ing flag up every f -- -ing morning at f -- -ing sunrise.'\"", "But in 1998, David Brock himself expressed skepticism about the validity of some of the claims he made in his American Spectator \"Troopergate\" article and doubts about the truthfulness of the sources he depended on for it:", "I guess that I should confess that as the author of the infamous piece, I think \"proving Troopergate\" may be a tall order. I was as sure of that story when I wrote it as any journalist can be of any story. But in the years since then, the troopers have greatly damaged their credibility.", "I'm sure you remember that during the Senate Whitewater hearings, the troopers made fools of themselves with improbable claims about the circumstances of Vincent Foster's death. One of the two troopers who went on the record with me, Larry Patterson, helped promote the infamous Clinton Chronicles, a crackpot video accusing [Bill Clinton] of drug running and murder. Patterson was also recently cited as a source for The Secret Life of Bill Clinton, by British journalist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard.

In 1970, when Senator Walter Mondale (then chairman of the Subcommittee on Migratory Labor, under the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare) was conducting an investigation into migrant labor problems, Califano was retained by Coca-Cola chairman and CEO Paul Austin to represent that company.  (Coca-Cola was involved in the issue Mondale was investigating due to its 1960 acquisition of Minute Maid, whose Florida groves employed migrant farm workers.)   According to Califano's 2004 memoir (Inside: A Public and Private Life), Hillary Rodham, then a first-year law student at Yale, was present at the Senate hearings and chastised him for daring to represent corporate interests:", "On July 24, 1970, at 10 A.M., the hearings were held in the Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Building, the scene of many great Senate confrontations, include the McNamara muzzling-the-military hearings, which I had lawyered almost ten years earlier.  As [Paul] Austin, [Coca-Cola food division head] Luke Smith, and I entered the Caucus Room on that steamy Washington morning, it was so jammed with spectators that many were standing and sitting on the floor. A large number were student interns working on the Hill that summer, angry about Nixon's bombing Cambodia, dispirited about the four students killed at Kent State University that May.  Many in that room had been among the 100,000 young Americans who had earlier that summer clogged the city to protest the war. Anti-establishment fervor, at a fever pitch that July, was palpable in the hearing room.", "About half way down the aisle, a young woman with dark hair and thick-rimmed glasses abruptly came in front of me and said, \"You sold out, you motherfucker, you sold out!\" I kept walking, pretending to ignore her.

It was Hillary Rodham, who was graduating from Yale Law School later that year. Neither of us mentioned the incident in the Senate Caucus Room. I offered her a job, but she decided to go to Arkansas rather than practice law in Washington.", "An endnote indicates Califano confirmed the date and time of Hillary Rodham's 1973 interview at his firm through a notation in his daily calendar, but how he recognized her from having encountered her fleetingly on a single occasion years earlier is not explained.

Even though she adhered generally to his anti-establishment philosophy (\"You know, I've been on this kick for twenty-five years,\" she would say after becoming First Lady), Hillary turned down an offer to work with [Saul] Alinsky as a paid community organizer in Chicago. \"She just didn't think she could bring about real social change that way,\" said her political science professor, Alan Schechter. According to Schechter, who gave Hillary's senior thesis an A, she wrote that \"organizing the poor for community actions to improve their own lives may have short-term benefits for the poor but would never solve their major problems. You need much more than that. You need leadership programs, constitutional doctrines.\"", "\"The only way to make a real difference,\" Hillary told one friend, \"is to acquire power.\" According to Schechter, his prize pupil decided the best way to accomplish this was by finding a way to \"use the legal system\" as an agent of change.", "As is common in Andersen's books, the endnotes for the corresponding chapter reference a number of conversations and print articles but don't indicate which might have been the source for this putative quote.", "\"We just can't trust the American people to make those types of choices ... Government has to make those choices for people\"", "This quote comes from a conversation relayed by Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, then the chairman of the Republicans' House task force on health care, at a 1993 meeting with Hillary Clinton (as reported in David Brock's The Seduction of Hillary Rodham):", "Dennis Hastert ... began meeting in February [1993] with Clinton administration officials as part of an effort to craft a bipartisan approach to [health care] reform.  One evening in June 1993, a group of Republican congressmen, including Hastert, met with Hillary at the Alexandria home of Republican Representative John Kaisch of Ohio. One of Hastert's ideas under discussion that night would have allowed employers the option of establishing medical savings accounts for their employees as an alternative to a government-managed system. Under Hastert's plan, employers would put the money they were willing to spend into tax-deferred accounts. Employees would be encouraged to buy high-deductible catastrophic care policies and pay for rudimentary services with the remainder of the money. At the end of the year, the unused funds could be rolled over tax-free into the next year and, like an IRA, be withdrawn at retirement. Hastert and other advocates believed that as people shopped around for insurance and spent their own money to purchase care, costs would be controlled and competition enhanced. But critics said the accounts would benefit healthier people, who would spend less than what employers contributed, and hurt the poor, who might pay higher premiums as healthier and wealthier people formed their own insurance purchasing pools.", "Hastert soon concluded that there was little common ground on which to negotiate with the administration. \"I guess the straw on the camel's back was a meeting that I had one evening with Mrs. Clinton,\" Hastert recalled:", "I mentioned ... to the first lady about medical savings accounts and just right away she said, \"We can't do that.\" And I said, \"Well, why?\" And she said, \"Well, there's two reasons.\" And I said, \"Well, what are they?\" [And she said] \"The first reason is with the medical savings account, people have to act on their own and make their own decisions about health care. And they have to make sure that they get the inoculations and the preventative care that they need, and we just think that people will skip too much because in a medical savings account if you don't spend it, you get to keep it or you can ... accumulate it in a health care account. We just think people will be too focused on saving money and they won't get the care for their children and themselves that they need. We think the government, by saying, 'You have to make this schedule. You have to have your kids in for inoculations here, you have to do a prescreening here, you have to do this' \u2014 the government will make better decisions than the people will make, and people will be healthier because of it.\" I said, \"Well, part of that's an education process. People have to understand that [if] they behave in a certain way, they're going to save money, [with the] preventive medicine issue \u2014 you get the prescreenings, if you can inoculate your kids you save money on it. I mean, they're not sick. You save money.\" She said, \"No. We just can't trust the American people to make those types of choices ... Government has to make those choices for people.\"", "\"I am a fan of the social policies that you find in Europe.\"", "In a 3 March 1996 Booknotes discussion with Brian Lamb about her recent published book, It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Our Children Teach Us, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said:", "Lamb: \"You talk about both the French and the Germans [in your book]...\"", "Clinton: \"Right.\"", "Lamb: \"... as having some things that are better than what we do here [in the U.S.].\"", "Clinton: \"And other cultures as well.\"", "Lamb: \"How about the Germans?\"", "Clinton:  \"Well, I am a fan of a lot of the social policies that you find in Europe, and I know that they, too, are going through a rethinking about how to afford some of their policies. But in my conversations with people like Chancellor [Helmut] Kohl or President [Jacque] Chirac, they are not talking about cutting back on their support for families to the extent that they are talking about doing some other things that would free up some dollars for the economy. That's because they see raising children as a social obligation, not just a parental obligation, even though parents have the primary responsibility, so that the kind of leave policies that they have for employees, particularly young mothers taking care of babies \u2014 the health-care policy in Germany that is a public-private mixture is something that I think is worth looking at.", "\"The visiting nurses program in England where people come into the home to try to make sure the parents know what they're doing, and that's for everybody from Princess Di down to a single teen-age mother. There's just more of a recognition that the entire society has a stake in making sure parents do as good a job as they can.\"", "Aldrich, Gary. \u00a0 Unlimited Access.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington, D.C.: Regnery Publishing, 1998. \u00a0 ISBN 0-89526-454-4 \u00a0 (p. 139).", "Andersen, Christopher. \u00a0 American Evita: Hillary Clinton's Path to Power.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York: HarperCollins, 2004. \u00a0 ISBN 0-06-056254-4 \u00a0 (pp. 90, 258-259).", "Andersen, Christopher. \u00a0 Bill and Hillary: The Marriage.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York: William Morrow, 1999. \u00a0 ISBN 0-688-16755-1 \u00a0 (p. 100).", "Brock, David. \u00a0 \"Living with the Clintons.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The American Spectator. \u00a0 January 1994.", "Brock, David. \u00a0 The Seduction of Hillary Rodham.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York: Free Press, 1996. \u00a0 ISBN 0-684-83451-0 \u00a0 (p. 333-334).", "Brock, David. \u00a0 \"Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Esquire. \u00a0 July 1997 \u00a0 (p. 52).", "Brock, David. \u00a0 \"Letter to the President.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Esquire. \u00a0 April 1998 \u00a0 (p. 60).", "Califano Jr., Joseph A. \u00a0 Inside: A Public and Private Life.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York: Public Affairs, 2004. \u00a0 ISBN 1-58648-230-0 \u00a0 (p. 212-213).", "Clinton, Hillary Rodham. \u00a0 \"Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Iraqi Elections.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=233875 \u00a0 28 January 2005.", "Couric, Katie. \u00a0 \"Hillary Clinton Talks Politics and Future.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dateline NBC. \u00a0 16 April 2004.", "Fouhy, Beth. \u00a0 \"San Francisco Rolls Out the Red Carpet for the Clintons.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 San Diego Union-Tribune. \u00a0 29 June 2004.", "Harris, John F. \u00a0 The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York: Random House, 2005. \u00a0 ISBN 0-375-50847-3 \u00a0 (pp. 98-99, 382-383).", "Kelly, Michael. \u00a0 \"Saint Hillary.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 23 May 1993 \u00a0 (Magazine; p.
