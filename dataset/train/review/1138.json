["What Christian in their right mind would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, an Oct. 10 Facebook post asks. As evidence, it points to a statement supposedly made by Harris that morning.", "\"American churches are PROPAGANDA CENTERS for intolerant homophobic, xenophobic vitriol,\" the post claims Harris said. It also has her calling American pastors \"knuckle-dragging disseminators of intolerance and enemies of social justice.\"", "\"Think about that,\" the post continues. \"That was a verbatim quote from Biden's running mate, who, God forbid, would become President if Biden won the election and if he passed/became incapacitated.
