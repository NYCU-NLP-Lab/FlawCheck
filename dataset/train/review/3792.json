["A viral Facebook post is urging users to pay attention to the bag size\u00a0of lettuce at the grocery store, claiming that\u00a0a\u00a0flatter lettuce bag indicates freshness, while a puffier bag means the lettuce has aged.", "\"If you buy bagged lettuce or salads, choose the bag that is the flattest. When the greens are packaged, all of the air is sucked out of the bag,\" reads a March 7 meme. \"Then as they age, they give off gass (sic), making the bag puffier. Choose the flattest bag and your salad will be fresher, and last longer in the fridge without going bad.\"", "Accompanying the text is an image of a grocery store\u00a0aisle with\u00a0bagged lettuce.

However, that does not suggest that larger bags of lettuce are not fresh,\u00a0according toEat This, Not That!", "Gas is not able\u00a0to\u00a0build up as much in bagged lettuce because of a design called \"modified atmosphere packaging,\" which improves the shelf life of\u00a0items through the manipulation of the atmosphere inside a packaged food, according to Industrial Packaging.", "In fruits and vegetables, oxygen is produced at high respiration rates, which means a shorter shelf life. To avoid this, oxygen is reduced and replaced with other gases to delay unwanted reactions.", "Further, the modified atmosphere packaging is created in a way that it \"breathes\" while also being able to maintain an atmosphere inside the package that will minimize any browning and spoilage, according to NPR.", "A 2009 study in the Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition\u00a0concluded that modified atmospheres, elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide and reduced levels of oxygen and ethylene, \"can be useful supplements to provide optimum temperature and relative humidity in maintaining the quality of fresh fruits and vegetables after harvest.\"", "Fact check:Mars Perseverance rover landing happened, Ingenuity helicopter can fly on Mars", "The best indicator of fresh lettuce is the bag's \"best by\" date, according to Eat This, Not That! and Delish.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u00a0states that,\u00a0\"the anticipated shelf life for many bagged, fresh-cut leafy greens is approximately 12-16 days\" and fresh-cut greens can last at least one week after the \"sell by\" or \"use by\" date.", "Salads are produced with around 16 code days, a date marking tool to ensure food safety, according to South Dakota Department of Health, and shoppers can work backward\u00a0to find out when it was packaged.
