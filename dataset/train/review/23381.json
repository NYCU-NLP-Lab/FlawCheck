["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says Donald Trump does a fine job of creating jobs - in China.", "Perez made that dig in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch shortly before he gave the keynote speech at the Democratic Party of Virginia\u2019s Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner on June 18.", "\"Go look at a Trump product. They\u2019re all made in China,\" Perez said.", "No doubt, many Trump products are made overseas, a point the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has acknowledged in debates and interviews.", "Perez went a few leaps beyond that in saying all Trump products are made in China. So we checked to see whether the secretary is right.", "We asked Perez\u2019s office for the source of his information. Mattie Munoz, his press secretary at the Department of Labor, said that since his comments were made on private time during a political event, she couldn\u2019t comment. She suggested contacting Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, which in turn forwarded our request to the Democratic Party of Virginia.", "Emily Bolton, a state Democratic Party spokeswoman, said she couldn\u2019t comment on Perez\u2019s statement but sent us links to a series of articles about Trump products that are made overseas.", "So we set out on our own window-shopping spree, eying items listed on The Trump Organization\u2019s website and searching for where they are manufactured.", "We found that many Trump items are made in China, including cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps and mirrors.", "It\u2019s impossible to get an exact read on what percentage of items are from China, because many items don\u2019t disclose their exact origin. Some listed on Amazon.com and other shopping websites merely say that they\u2019re \"imported.\"", "We emailed the Trump campaign twice to see what percentage of his products are made in China but didn\u2019t get a response.", "China isn\u2019t the only country that makes Trump products. The billionaire candidate acknowledged during a June 21 interview on ABC that his company manufactures neckties in China, suits in Mexico, furniture in Turkey, and barware in Slovenia.", "We found that some Trump ties were made in Indonesia and Vietnam in addition to China. Many Trump shirts were made in Bangladesh, and some sport coats were made in India.", "If you\u2019re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the U.S., including the candidate\u2019s iconic \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. PunditFact gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China.", "Here are some other Trump products that we found are manufactured in the U.S.:", "\u2022bedding comforters, advertised as being \"master suite worthy\";", "\u2022cologne, called \"Success by Trump\";", "\u2022Trump Natural Spring Water, served at Trump facilities. It\u2019s bottled in Willington, Conn. by the Village Springs water company; and", "\u2022Trump Wine, made on a 1,300-acre estate near Charlottesville. A disclaimer on the winery website says the GOP presidential candidate doesn\u2019t personally own the winery, which is run by his son, Eric.", "We also found a few Trump suits online that were made in the U.S.", "Trump has said he\u2019d like to make more products domestically, but the U.S. \u00a0can\u2019t compete with foreign countries that \"manipulate their currencies\" to reduce manufacturing costs.", "Trump\u2019s overseas product lines have become a central campaign issue for Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. In a June 21 speech, she accused the GOP candidate of hypocrisy for outsourcing his own products.", "Our ruling", "Perez said Trump\u2019s products are \"all made in China.\"", "There\u2019s an element of truth to his statement in that Trump clearly relies on China to produce many products -- ties, shirts, cuff links, sport coats, jackets, lamps, eyeglasses and mirrors. That buttresses the labor secretary\u2019s broader point that Trump relies on foreign labor to produce much of his product line.", "But Perez goes too far in saying all of Trump\u2019s products are made in China. They come from a lot of other places as well.", "We rate his hyperbolic claim statement Mostly False.", "Labor Secretary Thomas Perez\u2019s comments to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, June 18, 2016.", "Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech in Columbus, Ohio, June 21, 2016.
