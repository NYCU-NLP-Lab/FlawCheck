["\u201cGuess which community is waving Pakistan flags in India\u2019s Tamilnadu state? Buddhists? Zoroastrians?

The user seemed to have recorded the video first uploaded as a Facebook post.", "Ramzan in TN Palani, Neykarapatti.

The country\u2019s flag has a rightward facing crescent moon and star and a white strip on the left.", "The flags in the video do not have the white strip. Alt News noticed two different kinds of flags in the clip \u2013 one, which has a crescent moon and a star in the middle; two, which has a crescent moon and star in the middle and three stars on the left.", "The first kind is a typical Islamic flag often used by the Muslim community in the sub-continent. The origin of the second could not be traced, however, it too appears to be a generic religious flag.", "The Quint had earlier fact-checked the video and inferred that the flags seen in the video were of the India Union Muslim League (IUML). While the same could not be established by Alt News by looking at the video, The Quint spoke to a police officer in Palani Taluka who said, \u201cThe video is from Neikkarapatti. It is of a procession which was held during Ramzan here in the Kottaimanthai area of the village. It is an annual event, and happens every year\u201d. He further added that the video showed IUML flags and not the Pakistani flag.", "A longer version of the video was uploaded on Youtube on June 5. Here, the flags are more distinctly visible. One can clearly spot that none of them is the Pakistani flag as they do not have a white strip on the left.", "The fact-check conclusively establishes that the video does not depict Pakistani flags being raised in Tamil Nadu during Ramzan. Such misinformation regularly appears on social media, circulated several times by Tarek Fatah himself. Last year, the Pakistani-Canadian writer had shared an old video of IUML flags raised in Uttar Pradesh to claim that Muslims in Rajasthan waved Pakistani flags to celebrate Congress\u2019s victory in the assembly elections.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
