Elise Stefanik, R-Willsboro, charges her Democratic opponent doesn\u2019t know enough about the North Country to represent the 21st Congressional District.", "The ad, which began airing in early October, portrays Mike Derrick as out of touch with the region.", "A narrator in the ad says, \"When asked about bills in Congress important to the North Country, Derrick responded, \u2018I just don\u2019t know enough about it.\u2019 Elise Stefanik does.\" The narrator then highlights Stefanik\u2019s positions on a handful of issues important to the district.", "Derrick, a native of the Clinton County, attended schools in the town of Peru and Plattsburgh \u00a0before embarking on his Army career.

For us and so many other men and women in uniform, it was incredibly successful and effective,\" Derrick said. \"I believe that we can use that as a model to build a single-payer health care system for all Americans. With a uniquely American single-payer health care system, we can finally ensure that everyone has access to the health care that they and their family need. This is what we should be working toward.\"", "He also said in an article in North Country Now that moving in the direction of a single-payer health care system similar to what the military uses would eventually drive down costs for consumers.", "Our ruling", "Stefanik began airing an ad in October accusing Derrick of not knowing enough about the issues that affect the North Country.
