["About this rating", "Businesses, government buildings, and other entities in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, took part in a relatively widespread and striking initiative to mark Mike Pence's visit to the city by displaying rainbow flags as a gesture of apparent opposition to the vice president's past pronouncements on LGBT rights.", "Claims that the flags were flown by all major companies and \"everyone\" were exaggerated.", "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is particularly well-known outside of the U.S. for his past pronouncements and policies on LGBT rights, and the presence of the conservative Christian former congressman prompted protests in Ireland and Iceland during his visits to those countries in September 2019.", "According to one viral tweet, opposition to Pence's visit to Iceland was such that many local companies in the capital city, Reykjav\u00edk, conspicuously raised LGBT rainbow flags as a gesture of protest. On Sept. 4, the day of Pence's visit to Reykjav\u00edk, the Icelandic-American drag queen Heklina posted two photographs of a row of rainbow flags, along with the following message: \"Here\u2019s a great example of why I\u2019m proud to be from Iceland. Mike Pence is visiting the country and everyone is outraged. Mayor of Reykjavik, all the biggest firms and companies, everyone, they\u2019re all flying the gay flag. All Pence will see everywhere on his visit is gay gay gay.\"", "Here\u2019s a great example of why I\u2019m proud to be from Iceland ??Mike Pence is visiting the country and everyone is outraged.

But Pence's visit to Reykjav\u00edk was marked by an unusually widespread initiative to fly the LGBT rainbow flag among businesses, government buildings, and other entities in the city, especially those located close to a building where Pence held meetings with local officials.", "The two photographs Heklina included in her tweet were authentic. The one on the left was taken by Isold Uggadottir and shows a row of rainbow flags erected by the IT company Advania outside its building on Gu\u00f0r\u00fanart\u00fan in Reykjav\u00edk:", "The location was highly significant because the white building visible in the background, across the street from Advania, is H\u00f6f\u00f0i House, a historic Reykjav\u00edk landmark and the location where Pence met with Iceland's president Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson on Sept. 4:", "The photograph on the right in Heklina's tweet was also authentic and showed the same set of flags outside Advania's building. It appears to have been taken from an article published on the website of the Icelandic magazine Mannl\u00edf.", "A spokesperson for Advania confirmed in an email to Snopes that the company had erected the rainbow flags around 11.30 a.m. on the day of Pence's visit, adding, \"We felt it was a good day to celebrate diversity.\" However, the spokesperson declined to either refute or confirm the widely held understanding that the flags were flown specifically in response to Pence's visit or intended as a gesture of protest against his past pronouncements on LGBT rights. The rainbow flags were not taken down immediately after the vice president's meeting across the street, and as of Sept. 6 they were still in place, according to the spokesperson.", "Several other local businesses and even some official government buildings, especially in the neighborhood surrounding H\u00f6f\u00f0i House, also erected rainbow flags -- or allowed them to be erected -- during Pence's visit. Some entities did this on their own initiative, but others were encouraged to do so by T\u00f3tla S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir, an LGBT activist, and Katr\u00edn Oddsd\u00f3ttir, a prominent Icelandic human-rights lawyer.", "They distributed rainbow flags to several buildings on the day of Pence's visit, in an effort to form what S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir described to Snopes as a \"rainbow circle\" around the location of Pence's meeting with the president of Iceland.", "The following is an incomplete list of the entities that flew rainbow flags in Reykjav\u00edk during Pence's visit on Sept. 4:", "VS\u00d3 R\u00e1\u00f0gj\u00f6f, an engineering firm located across the street from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.", "\u00cdslenska Hamborgarafabrikkan, a hamburger restaurant located across the street from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.", "Reykjav\u00edk Service Center (12-14 Borgart\u00fan), an official municipal building located down the street from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.", "\u00c9g tel r\u00e9tt a\u00f0 Reykjav\u00edkurborg taki st\u00f6\u00f0u me\u00f0 mannr\u00e9ttindum. \u00c9g kalla\u00f0i \u00fev\u00ed eftir a\u00f0 sj\u00e1 regnbogaf\u00e1nann blakta vi\u00f0 h\u00fan a\u00f0 H\u00f6f\u00f0atorgi, \u00ed \u00feann mund sem Mike Pence m\u00e6tti til fundar \u00ed H\u00f6f\u00f0a.", "\u00c1fram fj\u00f6lbreytileikinn - frelsi\u00f0 og \u00e1stin! \u2764\ufe0f????? pic.twitter.com/eVOWCEdqsu", "\u2014 Hildur Bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir (@hildurbjoss) September 4, 2019", "Efling, a trade union located about five minutes' walk from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.", "7 Borgart\u00fan, headquarters of Rikiskaup, the Icelandic government's Office of Central Public Procurement, located one block away from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House (Photograph courtesy of Katr\u00edn Oddsd\u00f3ttir):", "Laugarneskirkja, a Lutheran church located about a mile east of H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.

Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson himself later retweeted Heklina's claims, but a spokesperson for City Hall told Snopes in an email that Eggertsson did not personally order the flags to be flown, though the spokesperson added \"I am sure he had nothing against it.\" Rather, the decision to erect LGBT rainbow flags outside City Hall was taken by \"officials and city staff,\" the spokesperson told us.", "We didn't find evidence that \"all the biggest firms and companies, everyone\" in Iceland had flown rainbow flags to protest Pence's visit there in September 2019, as Heklina wrote in her tweet. That appears to have been an exaggeration, perhaps for rhetorical effect. However, we did find evidence of a remarkable initiative among several entities in Reykjav\u00edk \u2014including City Hall, businesses, municipal and government buildings, and a church \u2014 to mark Pence's visit in that way.", "Given that this effort was particularly concentrated around H\u00f6f\u00f0i House, where Pence held meetings on Sept. 4, it is reasonable to imagine that the visual effect of the flags would have been quite striking to the vice president as he entered and exited that neighborhood.", "The fact that Reykjav\u00edk City Hall, a second official municipal building and an Icelandic government agency all joined in forming the \"rainbow circle\" is especially noteworthy.", "Drabold, Will. \u00a0 \"Here's What Mike Pence Said on LGBT Issues Over the Years.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 TIME. \u00a0 15 July 2016.", "Johnston, Ian. \u00a0 \"'Disco Outside the D\u00e1il' Protest Against Pence Visit.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0  Irish Times. \u00a0 3 September 2019.", "Hr\u00f6nn, Gu\u00f0n\u00fd. \u00a0 \"Advania Flaggar Regnbogaf\u00e1num \u00ed Tilefni Heims\u00f3knar Mike Pence.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mannl\u00edf. \u00a0 4 September 2019.", "Update [7 September 2019]: Added BSRB to the list of entities which erected rainbow flags to mark Vice President Pence's visit to Reykjav\u00edk.", "Update [11 September 2019]: Added Reykjav\u00edk City Hall to the list of entities which erected rainbow flags to mark Vice President Pence's visit to the city.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
