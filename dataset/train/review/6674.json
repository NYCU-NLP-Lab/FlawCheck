["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "At a town hall with CEOs, President Donald Trump revived some of his longstanding concerns about how the nation\u2019s unemployment statistics are calculated.", "Appearing to reference the number of Americans out of work, Trump said, \"We have 100 million people if you look. You know, the real number's not 4.6 percent (for the unemployment rate). They told me I had 4.6 percent last month. I'm doing great. I said yeah, but what about the hundred million people? A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people -- a good percentage of them would like to have jobs and they don't. You know, one of the statistics that, to me, is just ridiculous -- so, the 4.6 sounds good. But when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed. But I don't consider those people employed.\"", "Is Trump right that \"when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed\"? Not at all.", "Trump seems to suggest that government statisticians are performing something like medieval alchemy, turning lead (unemployment) into gold (employment) with the flick of a wand.", "That\u2019s not the case. Broadly speaking, if someone is already considered unemployed and they give up looking for a job, they would be counted as \"not in the labor force\" -- not as \"employed.\"", "In fact, there is an official statistical category for a person in this situation. If someone wants and looks for a job but then gives up, they are called \"discouraged workers.\" Specifically, these people \"want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months\" but are \"not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify.\"", "The problem for Trump is that \"discouraged workers\" are relatively rare -- in the most recent month, there were 522,000 of them. That\u2019s just one-fourteenth the number of unemployed workers, and only about one-half of 1 percent of the \"out of work\" Americans Trump seems to have been referring to.", "Speaking of which, as we have noted previously, Trump\u2019s 100-million figure of \"out of work\" Americans is highly misleading.", "This number -- in reality, a bit lower at 94 million -- includes any American age 16 and over who isn\u2019t institutionalized and who isn\u2019t either working or actively looking for work. This means the figure includes retirees, high school students over 16, undergraduate and graduate students, stay-at-home parents, disabled people, adults who are engaged in full-time education or training, and even trust-fund kids and those wealthy enough to be living off investments.", "In other words, the figure includes a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t be expected to be working, or who are engaged in other pursuits. We have previously estimated that no more than a quarter of the 94 million people not in the labor market are either out of work, looking for a job, or eager to get back in the job hunt if labor-market conditions were to improve.", "Here's a chart from the jobs site Indeed.com showing one analysis of the reasons that prime-working-age Americans may not be working.", "So suggesting that roughly 100 million Americans are out of work ropes in many people who, in fact, have no desire to find paid employment.", "Our ruling", "Trump said, \"When you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed.\" That\u2019s flat wrong -- someone who stops looking for work would be shifted to the \"out of the labor force\" category, not the \"employed category.\" We rate the statement False.", "Donald Trump, remarks at a CEO town hall, April 4, 2017", "PolitiFact, \"Fact-checking Donald Trump's address to Congress,\" Feb. 28, 2017", "PolitiFact, \"Donald Trump repeats Pants on Fire claim that unemployment rate could be 42 percent,\" Feb. 11, 2016", "PolitiFact, \"Donald Trump says U.S. has 93 million people 'out of work,' but that's way too high,\" Aug. 31, 2015", "Email interview with Jed Kolko, chief economist for Indeed.com, April 4, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
