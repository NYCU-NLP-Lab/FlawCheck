They define it generally as businesses with 500 or fewer employees.", "Immediately before claiming loans didn't go to \"small businesses,\" Biden said half the jobs in the U.S. are from small businesses, a stat that only works if you include all companies up to 500 employees.", "In a virtual campaign stop focused on La Crosse on May 20, 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took aim at the federal government\u2019s response to small business woes.", "As of early May 2020, almost one in three small businesses reported closing their doors temporarily, and nearly one-fourth said they were within two months of closing permanently, according to a survey by MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.", "The government\u2019s primary response has been the Paycheck Protection Program, which distributed more than $500 billion in forgivable loans for small businesses to use for payroll, mortgages, rent and utilities.", "But Biden claimed much of that effort missed the intended target \u2014 small businesses.", "\"Small businesses are the foundation of our communities and of this country and the American dream. And they also hire more people than all those major corporations combined,\" Biden said in the livestream appearance. \"Now because of what I\u2019d call a corrupt recovery that\u2019s focused on helping the wealthy, the well-connected, not the millions of mom and pops facing financial ruin, the warning signs are flashing.", "\"Forty percent of the initial small business funds didn\u2019t go to small businesses at all.\"", "We\u2019re going to focus in on that last line.", "Did 40% of the PPP funds really go somewhere other than small businesses?", "The PPP was intended as a lifeline to weather the economic shutdown, but funds disappeared quickly. The first pool of nearly $350 billion was exhausted April 16, with 80% of applicants unable to get funding, the Washington Post reported.", "A second round of funding was made available starting May 1. As of May 21, 2020, the program had approved 4.4 million loans for a total of $512 billion. The average loan was $116,232.", "The loans can be fully forgiven if funds are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The loans are subject to various requirements, such as recipients using at least 75% of the funds for payroll and maintaining or quickly rehiring employees.", "But there has been controversy over who received the funds.", "Many larger companies have returned funds they received through the program in the wake of public outrage, including Shake Shack and Potbelly.", "More than $1 billion from the first round of funding went to publicly traded companies, the Washington Post reported. And 43 loans went to companies with more than 500 workers.", "The Small Business Administration, which administers the PPP, typically defines a small business as one with less than 500 employees, though that figure can vary by industry. And the PPP included exceptions for some businesses above that level.", "The SBA hasn\u2019t released any data on the size of the firms receiving loans. Agency spokeswoman Carol Chastang said they intend to do so, but not until the PPP has ended.", "So the only available data that speaks to business size is the size of the loans.", "Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said that\u2019s what the former vice president based his claim on, assuming that larger loans meant larger businesses since the funding is intended primarily to cover payroll.", "Biden referred to the \"initial\" round of PPP funding, which ended April 16. Within that group, about 44% of the money was doled out in loans of more than $1 million.", "There was more recent data available at the time Biden said this, though, factoring in all loans through May 16. At that point about 36% of all funding was part of loans of more than $1 million.", "So 40% of the PPP funding went to larger loans, around the figure Biden cited.", "But is it accurate to refer to that portion as not going to small businesses?", "Biden\u2019s statement hinges on the definition of small business \u2014 and he uses two himself.", "The program Biden referenced is run by the SBA and specifically allows loans for businesses that meet that agency\u2019s definition \u2014 generally 500 or fewer employees. So under that definition every company receiving a loan is a small business.", "We gave U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson a True rating when he leaned on that SBA definition in May 2019 to say \"99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses.\"", "And Biden himself indirectly used this definition moments before making the 40% claim, when he said small businesses \"hire more people than all the major corporations combined.\" Gwin confirmed that was a paraphrase of an SBA statistic showing small businesses employ about half the private workforce.", "That SBA stat only holds true if you define small businesses as companies with 500 employees or less. If you drop the threshold to 100, that group employs one-third. If the cutoff is 20 employees, that\u2019s less than one-quarter of the private workforce.", "So Biden used the 500-employee cutoff to demonstrate how important small businesses are, then immediately abandoned it to claim companies getting the larger loans aren\u2019t actually small.", "That\u2019s problematic. It\u2019s fair for Biden to make the case that some businesses receiving the loans aren\u2019t what many would consider \"small,\" but it\u2019s not fair to use two different definitions to make adjoining points.", "Biden said \"40% of the initial small business funds didn\u2019t go to small businesses at all.\"", "We don\u2019t know how big the businesses getting the loans actually are, so Biden is creating his own definition of \"small businesses\" based on loan size. A definition that conflicts with the official government definition this program uses.", "What\u2019s more, that definition conflicts with how he referenced small businesses a few sentences earlier to discuss the impact they have on the economy.", "There\u2019s an element of truth here. The 40% figure roughly matches the portion of loans that topped $1 million, which given the purpose of the loan means these companies have operating budgets of at least several million dollars.", "But the way Biden explained this figure conflicts with both the government definition and his own definition from a moment earlier.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "YouTube.com, Virtual Rural Issues Roundtable with Joe Biden and Ron Kind in LaCrosse, WI, May 20, 2020", "U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Coronavirus Impact Poll, May 5, 2020", "Washington Post, Public companies received $1 billion in stimulus funds meant for small businesses, May 1, 2020", "U.S. Small Business Administration, Paycheck Protection Program, accessed May 21, 2020", "Politico, As deadline looms, companies rush to return small business funds, May 17, 2020", "U.S. Small Business Administration, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Report, May 16, 2020", "U.S. Small Business Administration, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Report, April 16, 2020", "Email exchange with Michael Gwin, spokesman for Joe Biden, May 20-22, 2020", "U.S. Small Business Administration, 2019 Small Business Profile, accessed May 22, 2020", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, Yes, small businesses account for 99% of all Wisconsin companies, May 7, 2019", "Email exchange with Carol Chastang, SBA spokeswoman, May 20-22, 2020", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
