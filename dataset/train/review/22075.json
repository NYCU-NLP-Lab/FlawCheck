Good to help out one another. Please let your friends know when u eat out w them, no don\u2019t give chance anymore. $300 is a lot of money for fine ? So don\u2019t sit on the tape with ( / ) or ( X ) ya. Same as queuing up.\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:", "Ya Kun refers to Ya Kun Kaya Toast, a Singaporean cafe franchise, and Compass1 refers to this\u00a0shopping mall in Singapore.", "\u201cX space\u201d is a reference to seats marked with a cross in certain establishments in Singapore that are\u00a0required to be kept empty as per government guidelines on social distancing.

In response to the misleading posts,\u00a0Enterprise Singapore, one of the government agencies overseeing the implementation of the social distancing order in the country, issued this statement on its Facebook page\u00a0on March 27, 2020.", "It reads, in part: \u201cThere is a rumour circulating on social media and via text messaging platforms claiming that an Enterprise Singapore safe distancing ambassador had imposed a fine on an individual, for sitting on a seat that was marked out as not to be occupied.", "\u201cThis is FALSE. Safe distancing ambassadors are deployed by various government agencies to guide and ensure that businesses implement and comply with the safe distancing measures. They do not impose fines.\u201d", "On March 26, 2020, Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health announced stricter \"safe distancing measures\" to be in place until April 30, 2020, to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Businesses are given 1-2 days to comply with the recommended measures, after which another check will be conducted.", "\u201cIf the measures are still not implemented, ESG and SFA will issue an official warning letter to the business owner. Following this, a third visit will be made for further checks on compliance.
