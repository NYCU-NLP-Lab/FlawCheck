["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on August 31, 2016", "Donald Trump\u2019s new TV ad promises a bright future if he\u2019s elected, and a gloomy one if Hillary Clinton wins. But that\u2019s based on murky evidence and misrepresentations.", "The Trump campaign released the ad, called \u201cTwo Americas: Economy,\u201d Aug. 29, and said it would run in nine battleground states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado.", "One big misrepresentation is a claim that \u201chundreds of thousands of jobs [would] disappear\u201d as a result of Clinton\u2019s proposal to raise taxes. The campaign cites a study by the Tax Foundation, which predicted no such thing.", "The study actually found that Clinton\u2019s plan would result in slightly less job growth than would be the case under current law. No jobs would \u201cdisappear.\u201d", "The Tax Foundation study said Clinton\u2019s plan would result in \u201c311,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs\u201d over the next 10 years, but that doesn\u2019t mean fewer than now \u2014 it means fewer than currently projected.", "Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, told us the Congressional Budget Office was projecting a gain of about 7 million new jobs under current law. \u201cWe see Hillary Clinton\u2019s tax proposals as maybe dialing that back to 6.7 million.\u201d", "And that\u2019s just one study, by a pro-business group that looked at only the impact of Clinton\u2019s tax plan. Another study, by Clinton supporter Mark Zandi and his colleagues at Moody\u2019s Analytics, considered the impact of all of Clinton\u2019s policy proposals, projecting a gain of 19 million jobs over 10 years, or 6 million more than under current law. Take your pick.", "The ad also claims that \u201cthe middle class gets crushed\u201d under Clinton, based on the same Tax Foundation study, which found that her tax policies would reduce wages by 0.8 percent. Again, however, that\u2019s a reduction in future growth, not a reduction in current wages.", "The Tax Foundation\u2019s Cole told us, \u201cCBO expects wages to rise about 36 percent over the next 10\u00a0years, or 12 percent after adjusting for inflation. The tax increases dial that back to about 11 percent.\u201d", "So under this pro-business group\u2019s projection, real wages would increase under Clinton by 11 percent instead of 12 percent. Whether that\u2019s being \u201ccrushed\u201d or not is a matter of opinion.", "After painting its bleak picture of life under Clinton using pictures of gloomy people in tones of gray, the ad shifts to full-color pictures of smiling people enjoying life under Trump.", "But the ad\u2019s colors are brighter than the murky evidence cited by the campaign.", "To support a claim that \u201cwages go up\u201d and \u201cmillions of new jobs\u201d would appear under Trump, the ad cites a Tax Foundation study of Trump\u2019s original proposal for a huge, nearly $12 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Not mentioned is that Trump has since abandoned that plan and proposed a different tax plan with higher tax rates than he proposed at first. The Tax Foundation has not analyzed his latest plan, as it lacks sufficient detail, Cole told us.", "The Trump plan is similar in some respects to a more detailed tax plan put forth by House Republicans. That plan calls for a cut less than one-fourth as large as Trump\u2019s original proposal; the Tax Foundation estimated it would reduce government revenues by $2.4 trillion over 10 years,\u00a0compared with Trump\u2019s abandoned $12 trillion cut.", "The Tax Foundation said the House GOP\u2019s plan would result in an \u201cadditional 1.7 million full-time equivalent jobs\u201d over 10 years. If one\u00a0rounds that up to 2 million, it would be correct grammar to use the plural \u201cmillions\u201d as the Trump ad does \u2014 but just barely. And in any case, Trump has yet to endorse that plan.", "The ad claims \u201cworking families\u201d would get tax relief under Trump. But that\u2019s not entirely clear from what he has said most recently.", "In his original plan, married couples filing jointly would have paid zero tax on taxable income up to $50,000. But as mentioned, Trump has set that plan aside, and it\u2019s unclear how his latest plan would affect middle-income workers. The Tax Foundation notes that Trump\u2019s most recent tax speech \u201cdid not address whether the revised tax plan would retain this large tax cut for middle-income taxpayers.\u201d", "Trump has specified that he would create three federal income tax rates for individuals of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. But he hasn\u2019t said which earners would fall into those brackets.", "In that respect, Trump is a little like Clinton, who also has been promising tax cuts for the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d but without as yet providing any details.", "What we know is that what Clinton has proposed so far is a $1.1 trillion, 10-year tax increase that would fall mostly on the very highest incomes. The nonpartisan\u00a0Tax Policy Center estimates that nearly 78 percent of the increase would be paid by the top 1 percent of earners, who are making more than about $732,000.", "That top 1 percent, on the other hand, would have received\u00a035 percent of the tax cuts Trump originally proposed, according to TPC\u2019s analysis. They would have seen an average tax cut of over $275,000, and a 17 percent increase in after-tax income in 2017.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cab483d1-0b71-44d7-aca5-5b6f112e80da", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
