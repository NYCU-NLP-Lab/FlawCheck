Also, it\u2019s impossible to \u2018find\u2019 a cast ballot in a ballot box \u2014 even if it were permitted to be opened before polls close \u2014 because all ballots are anonymous once cast. For absentee voters, the law assumes those voters cannot vote in person on Election Day (or during early voting). The COVID exception is new for this election, allowing in-county voters who otherwise can vote in person during the period but choose not to. Nevertheless, the law does not contemplate the opportunity of re-voting after the ballot is cast.

The question didn\u2019t break the top 20 searches for the day of the debate, Oct. 22, or any day since then, according to Google trends.", "The first version of the claim we could find was from the day after the debate in a story published on a New Jersey-based conservative website. Similar claims were featured on some other conservative outlets, including a weekend politics show on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky News Australia.", "They all cited Google Trends graphs that show the popularity of that question \u2014 or a similar question \u2014 over time.", "There are a few important things to understand about those graphs, though. First, they aren\u2019t showing actual search numbers. They are showing the relative popularity of the question over time. Second, they aren\u2019t comparing the number of searches for that question to other Google searches. As we said, the graphs are only comparing that one search query to itself, at various points in time. Third, and most importantly, the graphs can look very different, depending on how the parameters are set.", "For example, a graph with a tight timeframe, say, Oct. 17 to Oct. 25 \u2014 which covers the time shortly before the Oct. 22 debate and the days immediately after \u2014 shows what looks to be a rise in searches for that question right after the debate.", "But if the search is extended to go from Oct. 1 to Oct. 25, for example, the Google Trends graph shows interest in the question for most of the month. There are spikes on Oct. 2, Oct. 10 and Oct. 20, and then again on Oct. 25, the day that the ultra-conservative Gateway Pundit published a story linking interest in the question to unsubstantiated claims about Hunter Biden. That story was shared on Facebook pages with a combined following of 1.9 million, according to data from CrowdTangle.", "Extending that search to the end of the month shows that the most interest in that question in October came after Trump tweeted about it on Oct. 27.", "So, it\u2019s not true that the answer to, \u201cCAN I CHANGE MY VOTE?\u201d is \u201cYES\u201d in most states.
