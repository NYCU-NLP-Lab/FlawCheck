["About this rating", "Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has a reputation for giving\u00a0away footballs to young fans in the stands every time he scores a touchdown, a  tradition in which he has been engaging since at least as far back October 2011. According to a recent meme, the NFL fines Newton more than $5,000 every time he\u00a0gives away one of their balls:", "The meme shown here became popular\u00a0shortly after Newton had a humorous interaction with a referee on 6 December 2015. After scoring a touchdown,\u00a0Newton tried\u00a0to give the\u00a0football to a fan, but a referee interfered with the attempt:", "Props to Cam Newton for this. pic.twitter.com/SotxufxhQw", "\u2014 The Sports Quotient (@SportsQuotient) December 6, 2015", "The referee may have been slightly annoyed with Newton for giving away a football, but the the stunt\u00a0did not result in a\u00a0fine of $5,512  (or any other amount) from the NFL.", "However, while Newton is not fined $5,512 every time he gives away a football (and he certainly hasn't been fined more than $250,000 for the practice), there is some potential truth to the rumor. The NFL does have a\u00a0rule that prohibits players from throwing or kicking footballs into the stands:", "The NFL doesn't fine Newton for giving footballs away, according to a league spokesman. But all NFL players are fined $5,250 when they throw or punt a ball into the stands because of issues of crowd safety.", "The NFL could fine Cam Newton if he threw or kicked the ball into the stands, but the Panthers quarterback has never received this type of fine since he typically gently hands balls to spectators in the stands.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
