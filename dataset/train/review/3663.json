["Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, thinks her opponent has been in office way too long.", "Grimes released a new ad last week that blasted McConnell for his 30-year tenure in Washington. McConnell -- the expected Senate majority leader if he defeats Grimes and the GOP wins enough seats in November -- is running for his sixth term.", "The ad says that one of the side effects of staying in office too long is that a senator can become a multi-millionaire and lose sight of the needs of average constituents.", "\"What can happen in 30 years?\" the ad\u2019s narration says. \"A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office, while voting 17 times against the minimum wage, three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas, and 12 times against extending unemployment benefits for laid off workers.\"", "That\u2019s a lot to chew on, but we\u2019ll limit our assessment here to the question of whether senators can really make millions in office. Our friends over at the\u00a0Washington Post Fact Checker looked into a similar claim by Grimes in May and found that it fell flat. Because the charge is being aired anew, we decided to take a look.", "Senate salaries", "It\u2019s true that McConnell was not a millionaire when he became a senator in 1985 but has become a multimillionaire since then.", "As of 2012, his estimated worth was $22.8 million, making him the 10th-richest senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collects data on money in politics.", "That\u2019s almost twice as much net worth than the typical senator in 2012; the average was $12.1 million.", "The problem with the ad is its strong suggestion that McConnell made his millions from being a senator. That\u2019s not the case.", "When we asked the Grimes campaign for evidence, they pointed to Senate salaries going back to 1985.", "Senators\u2019 salaries have grown from $75,100 in 1985 to $174,000 in 2009, and they haven\u2019t changed since. McConnell has been the Senate minority leader since 2007, meaning his salary is higher -- about $193,400, according to the Congressional Research Service.", "(For comparison, Grimes\u2019 current annual salary as Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state is $117,329, according to the Kentucky state government\u2019s salary database.)", "So adding up annual salaries between 1985 and 2014 and adjusting for McConnell\u2019s leadership positions, McConnell would have earned more than $4 million before taxes and deductions.", "But as of 2012, McConnell is worth nearly $23 million. If his wealth didn\u2019t come from his office, how did McConnell get so rich?", "McConnell\u2019s wealth", "The truth is, much of McConnell\u2019s money comes from his second\u00a0wife, Elaine Chao, whom he married in 1993. (McConnell was married to his first wife, feminist scholar Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 until 1980.) Congressional financial disclosure forms cover both spouses if the lawmaker is married.", "Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, is the daughter of James S. C. Chao, the founder of a major international trade company.", "After immigrating to the United States from China in the 1960s, Mr.\u00a0Chao founded Foremost Maritime Corporation -- now the Foremost Group, of which he is the chairman. We couldn\u2019t figure out exactly how much James Chao is worth. But the Chao Family Foundations recently donated $40 million to build a new executive education center at Harvard Business School.", "So how did McConnell\u2019s finances change when he married Elaine Chao?", "The good news is that elected officials are required to fill out public financial disclosure forms annually. The bad news is that the Senate Public Disclosure Office at the Capitol tosses out any forms that are more than six years old.", "However, we were able to access McConnell\u2019s disclosure forms back to 1995 through the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. And McConnell\u2019s campaign gave us the forms for 1994, 1993 and 1992.", "All congressional financial disclosure forms show assets, income and liabilities in broad value ranges. For example, if someone owns a piece of property worth $800,000, it will be categorized on the form as being valued between $500,000 and $1 million.", "For consistency, let\u2019s assume the maximum amount possible based on those broad ranges. In 1992 -- in the middle of his second term and the year before he married Chao -- McConnell had up to $825,000 in assets and about $46,000 in income (such as speaking fees and investment returns) on top of his Senate salary. He also had up to $300,000 in liabilities, such as property mortgages, bringing down his net worth.", "After marrying Chao in 1993, McConnell reported a maximum of $2.6 million in assets -- including a piece of real estate worth up to $1 million that belonged to Chao -- and $93,500 on top of his Senate income. He also had $815,000 in liabilities. And that same year, McConnell inherited his mother\u2019s estate.", "Fast-forwarding to 2012, his net worth -- $22.8 million -- was nearly three times higher than it was five years earlier (in 2007, it was $7.8 million). In 2008, as we found in McConnell's discloure forms from that year, he and his wife\u00a0received a gift of between $5 million and $25 million after Chao\u2019s mother died. This apparently accounts for the bulk of the increase during that five-year period.", "Our ruling", "Grimes\u2019\u00a0ad said, \"What can happen in 30 years? A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office.\"", "What's\u00a0problematic here is the ad\u2019s strong suggestion that McConnell somehow managed to leverage his public office into personal riches. In truth, most of the growth in his wealth stems from his marriage and money his wife received after her mother died.", "The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate this claim Mostly False.", "Correction, Aug. 25, 2014: An earlier version of this article included the figure for Grimes\u2019 salary that was reported on her Senate candidate financial disclosure form. However, this figure -- $188,000 -- included earnings from 2013, as well as from part of 2014. To make the comparison equivalent to McConnell\u2019s salary, we\u2019ve adjusted her annual pay to $117,329.)", "Alison for Kentucky, \"What Can Happen,\" Aug. 15, 2014", "Washington Post, \"How did Mitch McConnell\u2019s net worth soar?,\" May 22, 2014", "Center for Responsive Politics, Mitch McConnell personal finances report, accessed Aug. 22, 2014", "Congressional Research Service, \"Congressional Salaries and Allowances,\" Jan. 7, 2014", "Congressional Research Service, \"The distribution of household income,\" March 10, 2014", "Senate financial disclosure, Grimes - 2014, Aug. 13, 2014", "Senate financial disclosure, McConnell - 2008, accessed Aug. 21, 2014", "Senate financial disclosure, McConnell - 1992, accessed Aug. 21, 2014", "Senate financial disclosure, McConnell - 1993, accessed Aug. 21, 2014", "Chao Family Foundations, \"About the Foundations,\" accessed Aug. 21, 2014", "New York Times, \"Girding for a Fight, McConnell Enlists His Wife,\" May 13, 2014", "Email and phone interview, McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore, Aug. 21, 2014", "Email interview, Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton, Aug. 21, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
