["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In 2011, Florida state legislators approved a bill to link teacher pay to student performance.\n\nDespite resistance from some educators, including a lawsuit filed by the teachers\u2019 union, state Rep. Bill Proctor, R-St. Augustine, stood firm behind Senate Bill 736. Proctor is the chair of a House education committee and chancellor at Flagler College.\n\n\"Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level, and grade level isn\u2019t that difficult,\" Proctor said in comments to the St. Augustine Record. \"We\u2019ll see which teachers affect learning in their students.\"\n\nWe were surprised by that statistic: Do half of Florida\u2019s high school graduates head off to college or work without reading at grade level?\n\nFlorida\u2019s seniors aren\u2019t tested for reading skills as they don their caps and gowns. But we found two compelling pieces of evidence that indicate Proctor is probably right.\n\nFCAT and college entrance exams", "Florida high school students take the\u00a0Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT, in the 10th grade.", "Proctor\u2019s office sent us to the most-recent 10th grade FCAT results. A \"3 or higher\" is considered reading at grade level. \u00a0During the 2010-11 school year, only 39 percent of nearly 186,000 10th graders scored that well.", "But 60 percent passed the test, which means it\u2019s possible to pass the test and read below grade level. Students are required to pass the 10th grade FCAT to graduate.\n\nStudents who fail have two opportunities per year to retake the test which would ultimately boost that 39 percent figure who scored at grade level. The retest data mixes students from different years, though, so we can\u2019t give a definitive number for how many more students passed the FCAT in a specific graduating class.\n\n\"Yes, we graduate students that cannot read on 10th grade reading level,\" said Lindy Smith, an aide to Proctor, in an email. \"Of those students passing the 10th grade Reading FCAT, I do not know how many actually graduated - but as you know students must pass 10th grade Reading FCAT in order to graduate. We expect some growth in reading in grades 11 and 12 but do not test those results on FCAT.\"\n\nThe other piece of evidence came from the Florida Department of Education. Staff there pointed us to a December 2011 report on school assessment standards.\n\nThe report stated that to be \"college ready\" students must graduate from high school, take certain courses and demonstrate basic literary skills. During the 2009-10 school year, 55 percent of the graduating seniors scored college ready for reading based on the ACT, SAT or CPT (The CPT, or College Placement Test, is primary used for the state\u2019s public community colleges.) That number, too, supports Proctor\u2019s claim.\n\nExperts on testing and education", "If the number of students reading at grade level is so abysmally low, why the repeated push for testing?\n\nWe posed that question to Matthew Ladner, a senior advisor of policy and research for the Foundation for Excellence in Education (chaired by former Gov. Jeb Bush). Ladner\ncoauthored Report Card on American Education: Ranking State K-12 Performance, Progress and Reform for the American Legislative Exchange Council.\n\nWithout the testing, Florida wouldn\u2019t have a measurement of its students\u2019 performance, he said. And although no one is happy about that 39 percent figure of students reading at grade level in the 10th grade, Florida has made gains. Ladner pointed to the National Assessment of Education Progress which tests samples of students. Florida\u2019s fourth grade reading results were below the national average in 1998, but climbed enough by 2011 to be above the national average.\n\n\"What you find is while there is still plenty of room for improvement in Florida, there has been a large amount of progress in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nWe also spoke with Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, a national organization which advocates for better forms of assessment. Schaeffer said that Proctor\u2019s claim sounded accurate, but he said that what constitutes \"grade level\" isn\u2019t objective criteria.\n\n\"Grade level is a political construct,\" he said. \"If you gave the FCAT to many competent adults they would fail.\"\n\nSchaeffer also said that the SAT and other college entrance exams are given to students who are already college bound, so that measure doesn\u2019t provide a full picture -- for example students who have dropped out.\n\nThe State Board of Education approves the achievement level descriptions for FCAT 2.0.\n\nOur ruling\n\nProctor said \"Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level.\" The results for 10th grade reading FCAT show only 39 percent at grade level. Some additional students met that grade level mark through retests or by a sufficient score on the SAT or ACT, which would boost that 39 percent figure. Another way to measure Proctor\u2019s claim is by looking at the percentage who were deemed college ready for reading based on college entrance exams, and that figure was 55 percent for 2009-10. By both measurements, the figure is close to 50 percent.
