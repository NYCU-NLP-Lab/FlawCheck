Clinton, in contrast, remains on the side of the frackers, Sanders said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, when he launched a multipart attack on Clinton\u2019s positions on fracking, trade and campaign finance.", "\"Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water,\" he said April 10, \"and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country.\"", "Was Sanders telling the fracking truth?

Some environmentalists, though, are doubtful that it\u2019s that much better than coal or oil, given reports that fracking can cause methane leaks (a greenhouse gas that\u2019s much more potent than carbon dioxide) and earthquakes and set water ablaze.", "Clinton clearly supported the practice as secretary of state. Her special envoy for international energy affairs launched the Global Shale Gas Initiative encouraging other countries to explore shale as an energy source.", "An in-depth investigation by progressive magazine Mother Jones said that Clinton\u2019s support of fracking was \"part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel.\"", "We found instances of Clinton and the State Department talking up fracking to Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India.", "\"The United States will promote the use of shale gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources,\" Clinton said in a 2009 speech to the Inter-American Development Bank.", "After Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she continued to support fracking but repeatedly called for \"smart regulations\" in speeches and in her book, Hard Choices.", "Fracking with nuance in 2016", "Compared with Sanders\u2019 unequivocal opposition and the Republicans\u2019 strong support, Clinton has a more complicated answer when it comes to fracking.

Estimates for fugitive emissions, typically expressed as a percentage of the total production, vary widely.
