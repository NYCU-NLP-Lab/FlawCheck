The claim remains noteworthy because income is on the minds of farmers completing their planting season and the coronavirus pandemic has led Congress to allocate billions of dollars in federal aid, with additional legislation pending.", "\"You suffered a lot with people that were stupid,\" Trump said at the rally. \"Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster.\"", "Whether that income has gone up 50%, however, requires some explanation.", "Alejandro Plastina, an assistant professor of economics at Iowa State University, said net income has increased, but mostly because a large portion of it came from federal aid to farmers in 2017 through 2019 to counter the effects of a United States trade dispute with China.", "Plastina said removing direct government farm program payments would show 2016 through 2019 net income, which accounts for total yields and additional revenue farmers collect, increasing 42% and net cash income that covers only total crop yields and livestock increasing 17% percent.", "Why the different net income figures, and why are they different from Trump\u2019s? Because the U.S. Department of Agriculture calculates net farm income by taking into account farmers\u2019 inventories, total yield revenues, and machinery and other costs applied to the production process that offset income. For example, the net cash income that only encompasses total yields increased 25% with direct farm program payments from $95.6 billion in 2016 to $120 billion in 2019, according USDA Economic Research Service data.", "According to that USDA data, farm net income increased 50% from 2016, the last full year Barack Obama was president, through 2019, from $62.3 billion to $93.6 billion.

Today we\u2019ve seen a 20% increase in farm bankruptcy.\"", "According to the American Farm Bureau, farm bankruptcies in the U.S. increased 20% from 2018 to 2019, even with direct farm payment programs.

Data from the USDA shows that while net income has increased by 50%, but federal aid to farmers accounts for a large portion of that increase and the aid was not the usual kind of federal assistance farmers receive.
