Amidst growing accounts of bear encounters and sightings around the northern island town of Takikawa in September, city officials deployed the \u201cMonster Wolf\u201d robot to tackle the problem.", "The two robots were installed around farmland, and were meant to scare away intruders. The \u201cMonster Wolf\u201d is a shaggy body on four legs, with a blond mane and glowing-red eyes. When its motion detectors are activated, it moves its head, flashes lights, and emits 60 different sounds including howling and machine-like noises. The robots are manufactured by Ohta Seiki, which has sold around 70 units since 2018.", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=45&v=-gI3KdrKfbs&feature=emb_title", "According to Japanese news outlet Kyodo News, there were 13,670 bear sightings across the various islands in Japan from April to September 2020 \u2014 the highest number for this time period since 2016.
