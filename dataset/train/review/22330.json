["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 10, 2019", "Under President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2018, there would have been hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits each year from 2018 to 2027, according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That contradicts Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s claim that the U.S. \u201cwould actually be on a glide path to balancing the budget\u201d had Congress enacted Trump\u2019s desired plan.", "CBO did say that deficits and debt would be lower under Trump\u2019s plan than they would have otherwise been under law at the time. But, while the Office of Management and Budget projected that Trump\u2019s budget would add $3.2 trillion to the deficit over that 10-year period, CBO estimated deficits would increase by $6.8 trillion. And, in 2027, when OMB projected there would actually be a $16 billion surplus, CBO estimated a $720 billion deficit.", "Mulvaney, still the OMB director, made his claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Jan. 6. When the show\u2019s host, Jake Tapper, said that former House Speaker Paul Ryan was frustrated the president \u201cdoesn\u2019t show any political will or interest in doing anything that would reduce the deficit or the national debt, other than growing the economy,\u201d Mulvaney claimed that Trump\u2019s first budget proposal paved the way to a balanced budget.", "Mulvaney, CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Jan. 6: But maybe you should remind him the next time he tells you, that it\u2019s the Congress that actually spends the money. If the Congress had adopted the president\u2019s budgets over the last two years, we would not have the deficit that we have now, not have the debt that we have now, and would actually be on a glide path to balancing the budget, which is what our first budget did.", "But the budget wouldn\u2019t come close to being balanced, CBO said.", "Trump\u2019s OMB did estimate that his 2018 budget would reduce projected deficits by $5.6 trillion over 10 years. Trump\u2019s plan to reduce spending, the administration said, would increase the deficit in 2018, but produce smaller deficits than there would have otherwise been each year from 2019 until 2026. Plus, there would be a budget surplus in 2027.", "However, CBO, making different economic assumptions than OMB, including slower economic growth, reached a different conclusion. It said Trump\u2019s plan increased deficits and debt less than current law would, but that the difference was not as much as OMB figured.", "For example, CBO found the president\u2019s budget would reduce projected deficits by $3.3 trillion over 10 years, but would still add a total of $6.8 trillion to the deficit in that time.\u00a0(That\u2019s a static estimate, not taking into account macroeconomic effects. CBO said that \u201ceconomic feedback would further reduce the cumulative deficit between 2018 and 2027 by roughly $160 billion.\u201d) OMB, on the other hand, estimated that Trump\u2019s budget would increase the deficit by just $3.2 trillion over 10 years, or less than half of what CBO said.", "More important, in 2027, when OMB said the budget would balance with a $16 billion surplus, CBO projected there would be a $720 billion deficit.", "In other words, as the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explained: \u201cOverall, CBO\u2019s estimate shows that after adjusting for extremely rosy assumptions, and even after incorporating deep unspecified spending cuts, the President\u2019s budget would fall well far short of balance, allow debt to rise from today\u2019s levels, but nonetheless, reduce the debt significantly relative to current law.\u201d", "We\u2019d also note that budget came out before Trump signed Republican-crafted legislation overhauling the tax code in December 2017. CBO estimates the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase deficits by $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028.", "As for Trump\u2019s budget for fiscal 2019, CBO said it, too, would result in higher deficits and debt, though to a lesser degree than without Trump\u2019s proposed policies.", "\u201cCompared with CBO\u2019s baseline projections, the deficit under the President\u2019s proposals would be smaller in every year between 2019 and 2028,\u201d CBO said. \u201cOver that period, the cumulative deficit would be $3.0 trillion smaller than the $12.4 trillion in CBO\u2019s baseline,\u201d and \u201c[a]s a result of those smaller deficits, debt held by the public would also be smaller each year under the President\u2019s proposals than under current law.\u201d", "Still, CBO projected that Trump\u2019s budget would lead to a cumulative deficit of $9.4 trillion over the 2019\u20132028 period, and that federal debt held by the public would climb from 79 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 86 percent of GDP in 2028. It did not say the budget would balance.", "Again, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said: \u201cCBO\u2019s analysis shows that with realistic economic assumptions, even the President\u2019s aggressive package of spending cuts would not be enough to prevent the debt from rising as a share of the economy nor to avoid the return of trillion-dollar deficits. Unfortunately, the recent tax cuts and spending bills have made an unsustainable fiscal situation even harder to bring under control, especially without major changes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, and the tax code.\u201d", "Even OMB said Trump\u2019s fiscal 2019 budget would add more than $7 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, and it did not project the budget was on a path to being balanced.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
