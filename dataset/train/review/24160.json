["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on December 19, 2019", "A bogus headline claims that a \u201csecond Democrat\u201d has left the party \u201cin 24 hours\u201d because of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. But one of them is a state senator who left the party a month ago and his decision had nothing to do with the impeachment.", "A headline blaring, \u201cImpeachment Backfiring: SECOND Democrat Leaves The Party In 24 Hours,\u201d has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook since it was posted Dec. 15. But it\u2019s not accurate.", "The story refers to Rep. Jeff Van Drew and John Yudichak, a\u00a0state senator in Pennsylvania.", "The day before it was published, news reports that Van Drew had decided to leave the Democratic Party and join the Republicans began circulating online. Van Drew represents the 2nd Congressional District in New Jersey \u2014 which has more registered Democrats than Republicans, although President Donald Trump won the district in 2016. Van Drew has publicly opposed impeaching Trump, drawing praise from the president on Twitter.", "When it came to the vote on impeachment, Van Drew was one of two Democrats to vote against the first article, abuse of power, and one of three Democrats to vote against the second article, obstruction of Congress.", "Although Van Drew had recently declined to confirm whether or not he would actually leave the Democratic Party, he sat with Trump in the White House the day after the impeachment vote and announced that he would join the Republican Party.", "On Nov. 19, almost a month before the reports about Van Drew possibly switching parties, Yudichak announced that he would leave the Democratic Party to become an independent and caucus with the Republicans in the Pennsylvania Senate. Now he is not affiliated with any party, his spokeswoman, Carly Simpson, confirmed in an interview with FactCheck.org.", "The state senator has no bearing on the impeachment inquiry, and he hasn\u2019t said anything about impeachment in the many interviews he\u2019s given about his decision. Rather, he\u2019s repeatedly said some version of what he told Neil Cavuto of Fox News on Nov. 23: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as leaving the Democratic Party or embracing the Republican Party. What I\u2019m doing in moving to become an independent is really trying to change the toxic conversation that we have going on here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across the country.\u201d", "Asked if Yudichak has a position on impeachment, Simpson told us, \u201che\u2019s a state senator \u2014 we\u2019re not getting involved in that.\u201d", "Also, in October, Yudichak endorsed Democrat Joe Biden for president, and said in late November on PBS\u2019 \u201cKeystone Edition\u201d that he would continue to support Biden for president \u201cand continue to support other Democratic ideas.\u201d", "So, the story that follows the bogus headline is wrong to claim that \u201cYudichak\u2019s announcement comes less than 24 hours since we learned that New Jersey Democratic Congressman Jeff Van Drew has also made a decision that speaks volumes.\u201d Yudichak announced his decision nearly a month prior, and it had nothing to do with the impeachment inquiry.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
