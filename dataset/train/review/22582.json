["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In an attempt to portray Mitt Romney as \"all over the map\" on foreign policy, President Barack Obama said the candidate once argued that the United States \"should ask Pakistan for permission\" to strike Osama bin Laden.\n\n\"When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call,\" Obama said at the debate in Boca Raton, Fla. \"But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man. And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve previously rated an Obama claim that Romney\u2019s view on killing bin Laden was \"it's not worth moving heaven and earth.\" We found it Half True. While Romney used those words, he also explained that he wanted to see a broader focus against the \"worldwide jihadist effort,\" not just the al-Qaida leader.\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019re asking whether Romney once said \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to strike if bin Laden was in reach.\n\n \u2018We keep our options quiet\u2019\n\nObama approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist  mastermind in his compound in Pakistan.\n\nThe secret, unilateral Navy SEALS mission followed through on a 2007 Obama campaign promise: \"If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President (Pervez) Musharraf won't act, we will.\"\n\nObama\u2019s words attracted criticism from his Democratic and Republican opponents at the time \u2014 including Romney.\n\nThe Republican primary candidate told reporters in Iowa in August 2007 that Obama\u2019s comments were \"ill-timed and ill-considered.\"", "A Romney campaign news release in December 2007 said, \"Sen. Obama Recently Suggested Attacking Inside Pakistan Without Pakistani Approval.\"\n\nRomney didn\u2019t explicitly say that he would ask for permission to strike inside the country.\n\nRather, he said he wanted to \"participate with other nations,\" to fight terrorism and criticized Obama for saying he would attack \"without Pakistani approval.\"\n\nAnd there\u2019s a bit more to the story.\n\nAt the Aug. 5, 2007, Republican debate in Iowa, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Romney to explain his reaction to Obama\u2019s pledge.\n\n\"I think Barack Obama is confused as to who are our friends and who are our enemies,\" Romney said. \"... He says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend.\"\n\nStephanopoulos pushed for details: \"But if your CIA director called you and said we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no. What do you do?\"\n\nRomney responded:", "Stephanopoulos clarified: \"So ... what I'm hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it was foolish to talk about it in public. Does anybody disagree with that?\"\n\nA transcript shows former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson speaking up \u2014 but not Romney.\n\n Our ruling\n\nObama claimed that during the 2008 campaign, Romney said, \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to take out bin Laden. The reality is somewhat more complex.\n\nRomney did express a preference for working with the Pakistanis, and he attacked Obama for saying he would strike if Musharraf wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBut Romney\u2019s clearest objection was to Obama saying the United States would attack inside Pakistan without approval \u2014 not to the option itself. \"We keep our options quiet,\" he said.\n\nObama oversimplified Romney\u2019s stance four years ago.
