["By Robert Farley", "Posted on December 12, 2019", "President Donald Trump accused CNN of manipulating video to make it appear that \u201cmassive crowds\u201d protested his decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Trump called it \u201cfake news as usual,\u201d but we couldn\u2019t find any CNN video that had been manipulated in the ways Trump claimed. The White House didn\u2019t provide any evidence, either.", "Instead, a CNN reporter, speaking from the West Bank nearly a week after Trump\u2019s announcement, said that the response by Palestinians to Trump\u2019s announcement was \u201cmuted, at least by what the expectations were\u201d and that \u201cthe number of Palestinians who have taken to the streets remains, relatively speaking, low.\u201d", "And while the protests at the time of the announcement of the embassy move were not as large as some expected, when the embassy actually opened in Jerusalem in May 2018, the New York Times reported that \u201ctens of thousands of Palestinians took part\u201d in protests in Gaza. At least 58 demonstrators were killed and more than 2,700 demonstrators were injured.", "During remarks at the Israeli American Council National Summit on Dec. 7, Trump said that while presidents for two decades promised to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, \u201cI kept my promises.\u201d Trump said after word got out that he intended to announce the move, he was \u201cbesieged\u201d by calls from foreign leaders trying to dissuade him \u2014 but he dodged the calls.", "Trump said after he actually made the announcement, the mass violence some had warned of never materialized. But he said CNN\u00a0tried to \u201ccon\u201d viewers into thinking otherwise.", "Trump, Dec. 7: And a day went by, and a second day went by, and there was no violence. I heard there was going to be massive violence. They showed violence \u2014 because about 20 people were violent in the front row, but there was nobody behind them. So CNN had the cameras very low, pointing to the sky. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true.", "They said, \u201cMassive crowds have gathered. Massive crowds.\u201d And I looked, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a strange angle. I\u2019ve never seen that angle.\u201d It was like \u2014 you had a cameraman sitting on the floor pointing up. But every once in a while, you say, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody behind the people in the front row. What\u2019s going on?\u201d And it was a con. It was fake news as usual.", "We reached out to the White House press office for clarification about which CNN report the president was referring to, but we did not get a response.", "However, the reports we found from CNN at the time of the announcement contradict the president\u2019s anecdote. (This\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0first time\u00a0that we have written about the president\u2019s false or unsubstantiated claims of \u201cfake news.\u201d)", "Trump announced on Dec. 6, 2017, that he would officially move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Although Palestinian groups called for \u201cthree days of rage\u201d in protest of Trump\u2019s announcement, mass violence did not unfold on the scale many feared.", "The day after Trump\u2019s announcement, CNN reporter Ian Lee \u2014 wearing a bulletproof vest and military helmet \u2014\u00a0 reported live from Ramallah on the West Bank about protests that had broken out at the border with Israel.", "\u201cPalestinians did call for a strike,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBusinesses are closed. Schools are closed. And you are seeing a lot of people go out in the street and voice their anger.\u201d Some of them, he said, were burning tires. Lee, along with what looked like a few hundred protesters, scattered as Israeli soldiers fired tear gas into the crowd to disperse it.", "CNN\u2019s reporting was similar to that of other news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and the Times of Israel. In a Dec. 7, 2017, story, the Wall Street Journal said \u201c[c]lashes between Israelis and Palestinians erupted\u201d after Trump\u2019s announcement.", "Wall Street Journal, Dec. 7: Battles broke out in a number of West Bank cities and near Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities, who said about 50 Palestinians were injured. Youths burned tires and threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets.", "A day later, the Times of Israel reported that an \u201cestimated 5,000 Palestinian protesters held demonstrations and clashed with Israeli security forces at some 30 locations across the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday [Dec. 8, 2017] after midday prayers, in a show of anger over US President Donald Trump\u2019s declared recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201d", "The New York Times on Dec. 8 said that \u201cthousands of Palestinian protesters confronted Israeli soldiers at the Gaza border,\u201d and \u201cscores of protesters were said to have been wounded, many by rubber-tipped bullets.\u201d However, the Times said that \u201cthe enormous wave of violence that had been feared after Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to formally recognize Jerusalem\u00a0as the capital of Israel did not immediately materialize.\u201d", "Several days later, on Dec. 12, CNN\u2019s Arwa Damon again reported from the streets of Ramallah, where a couple dozen protesters could be seen hurling rocks at Israeli forces. A chyron noted that in the days following Trump\u2019s announcement there were \u201cdozens hurt in protests against U.S. embassy move.\u201d But CNN did not attempt to pad the size of the crowds.", "To the contrary, Damon reported that \u201cthe number of Palestinians who have taken to the streets remains, relatively speaking, low.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a back and forth,\u201d Damon reported of the violent skirmishes between protesters and Israeli forces. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the norm here. In fact, a little muted, at least by what the expectations were. \u2026 Yet that is hardly a reflection of what is happening within the population\u2019s heart, the anger of it all.\u201d", "Later, the report included footage of a \u201csmall demonstration\u201d that had taken place in Ramallah earlier, a peaceful march that the video makes clear included only several dozen people. The CNN video shows the camera angle at street level, but also from above looking down at the crowd.", "Those demonstrations, however, were dwarfed by the ones surrounding the actual opening of the embassy in Jerusalem in May 2018, many of which were marked by violence.", "According to the New York Times, on the day of the embassy relocation, \u201ctens of thousands of Palestinians\u201d took part in protests focused on the embassy move. The protests turned bloody when demonstrators tried to cross a border fence separating Israel from Gaza, the Times reported, and Israeli soldiers fired on the protesters. Palestinian officials said at least 58 people were killed and more than 2,700 injured \u2014 at least 1,350 by gunfire.", "The same day, Fox News reported: \u201cMore than 35,000 protesters amassed at a dozen locations\u201d along the Israeli border, and 52 Palestinians were reportedly killed.", "From the Israel-Gaza border, Fox News\u2019 Benjamin Hall reported that some \u201chad hoped that they wouldn\u2019t come out in the numbers that they did. But they did. And in fact this is the most violent day that we\u2019ve seen here on the border since the War of 2014.\u201d", "Speaking at the Israeli American Council National Summit, Trump also added another layer of exaggeration to an already bogus anecdote about how he balked at a $1 billion price tag for a new embassy in Jerusalem and instead renovated an existing facility for about $250,000.", "The renovation is a temporary solution, and Trump\u2019s State Department has said there was never a formal proposal for a new building.", "As we wrote in our March 6, 2018, story \u201cTrump\u2019s Bogus Embassy Boast,\u201d during a briefing on Feb. 26, 2018, then State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: \u201cWe have not had any formal discussions or any formal proposals of the sort, and when it comes to overall cost estimates, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll have to work out with Congress.\u201d", "We won\u2019t rehash all the details except to note that in previous tellings \u2014 more than 10 times \u2014 Trump has said he was told the cost of a new embassy was estimated at $1 billion. In the version he offered at the recent summit, however, Trump repeatedly claimed that staff came to him and said \u201cthey want to spend $2 billion to build the embassy.\u201d", "We asked the White House press office for documentation of such an estimate, but we received no response.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org collaborates with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d to produce online fact-checking videos, which can be viewed\u00a0here.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
