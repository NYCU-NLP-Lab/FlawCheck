["About this rating", "On Sept. 15, 2020, Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden sat down with Jose Diaz-Balart for an interview on Telemundo Noticias. Shortly after the interview aired, a 26-second clip started to circulate in conservative circles that purported to show how Biden was \"caught red-handed\" using a teleprompter \u2014 insinuating that Biden's answers were scripted. This clip reached a wider audience on Sept. 21, when U.S. President Donald Trump's son Eric shared the clip with the comment: \"Unreal!\"", "Biden was not caught red-handed using a teleprompter. This clip is missing context and is being shared with a bad-faith accusation in an attempt to smear the presidential candidate.", "Biden's interview with Telemundo featured a number of questions from potential voters via a video stream that was broadcast on a nearby screen. In the above-displayed clip, Biden is addressing a woman on this video screen. When the video goes dark, he appears to say, \"OK, I lost that line,\" meaning that the video feed had gone dark. Diaz-Balart then tells Biden not to worry about the feed, and says, \"we can talk, you and I, on that\" issue.", "Here's a still from Telemundo's broadcast showing what was on this screen a few moments before the viral clip at the center of this false rumor:", "When Diaz-Balart was asked if Biden was using a teleprompter during this interview, he told Politico reporter Marc Caputo \"of course not.\"", "Diaz-Balart said: \u201cOf course not. He was asked to answer questions from Telemundo viewers \u2014they were on a monitor. He would answer the monitor. In one moment the monitor went to black \u2014 he said 'I lost the lady.' I told him he could answer looking at me. And that was that.\u201d", "Biden's full interview with Telemundo can be viewed below.
