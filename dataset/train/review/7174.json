["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Factual claims are apparently now like Pok\u00e9mon. They can be anywhere.", "We stumbled across an interesting factoid recently while flipping through a Snapchat story documenting First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s visit to West Africa and Morocco from June 27 to July 1. Obama just joined Snapchat, if you\u2019re interested.", "Snapchats disappear, but we were able to grab a screengrab with a sobering claim about illiteracy rates among women in Morocco. The snap had the headline \"Moroccan illiteracy\" and said that \"90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate.\"", "Is that true? Or should this claim disappear right along with your Snapchat?", "We wanted to find out.", "Tracking the claim to its source", "The journey of this claim is particularly interesting, and shows the perils of how incorrect or outdated statistics can be repeated over and over.", "The snap cites as its source a blog post by Vital Voices, a non-profit that advances women\u2019s causes around the globe.", "That actually is a reposting of an article from the IntLawGrrls website, a blog dedicated to discussion of international law and policy. The original IntLawGrrls post is from September 2011 and was written by Christie Edwards, the current director of international humanitarian law at the American Red Cross.", "Edwards claimed in her piece that \"recent surveys in Morocco estimated the country\u2019s illiteracy rate to be approximately 55 percent of all women. Fully 90 percent of rural women in Morocco are illiterate.\"", "Edwards\u2019 blog cites a UNICEF table of statistics.", "But that table doesn\u2019t correspond to her figures.", "The UNICEF table only lists an overall literacy rate of 74 percent for women 15-24 in Morocco (or an illiteracy rate of 26 percent). It makes no mention of illiteracy rates for a wider age range of women or for rural women specifically.", "So we asked Edwards where she got her data from.", "A spokeswoman told us the statistic actually comes from a 2004 USAID report on education in the Muslim world.", "That report includes, without citation, the following passage: \"Literacy levels remain very low: 63 percent for men and 38 percent for women. Illiteracy is a particular problem for women in rural areas, where nine out of 10 women are illiterate.\"", "The claim that nine out of 10 rural Moroccan women are illiterate goes back even further, to a 1996 USAID resource request report that claims, \"Women remain especially disadvantaged by low literacy (13% of rural women are literate).\"", "So to recap, a 2016 Snapchat relies on a crosspost of a 2011 blog that erroneously cites UNICEF data when in fact it\u2019s coming from a 2004 USAID report that is using a 1996 USAID resource request as is its foundation.", "If that sounds fishy, it is.", "Illiteracy in Morocco", "To find out the current illiteracy rate among Moroccan women, we examined public records maintained by UNESCO\u2019s Institute for Statistics. The website\u2019s profile on Morocco lists a literacy rate of around 62.05 percent for women aged 15 years and older in 2015, which translates to an illiteracy rate of 37.95 percent.\u00a0(Correction:\u00a0An earlier version of this fact-check listed a different percentage.)", "The database doesn\u2019t give specific information about illiteracy for rural versus urban women.", "Leonardo Menchini, the head of the social inclusion section at UNICEF Morocco, shared the most recent data on illiteracy rates for urban and rural populations with PolitiFact. UNICEF\u2019s data come from the 2014 Moroccan census.", "The takeaway: illiteracy remains an issue for females in Morocco, but not near the levels seen in the Snapchat.", "Our ruling", "A Snapchat story featuring First Lady Michelle Obama claimed that, in Morocco, \"90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate.\"", "That data is, in some cases, at least 20 years old -- way older than Snapchat.", "The claim cites old data from a report in 2004, that tracks back to a 1996 USAID request report. The most recent information from UNESCO and UNICEF indicate that Morocco\u2019s illiteracy among women is still relatively high (60 percent in rural areas and 42 percent overall), but much lower than what the snap says.", "We rate this claim False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/452873e9-e53d-4ae9-9483-c9f7c3576d83", "Email with Jenelle Eli, International Communications at the American Red Cross, July 7, 2016", "Email interview with Leonardo Menchini, head of the social inclusion section at UNICEF Morocco, July 8, 2016", "Haut Commisariat au Plan, \"Data from the 2014 general census of population and housing,\" accessed July 8, 2016", "Snapchat, \"Moroccan illiteracy,\" June 30, 2016", "USAID, \"Results review and resource request,\" March 1996", "USAID, \"Strengthening education in the muslim world,\" April 2004", "UNESCO Institute for Statistics, \"Morocco,\" accessed July 8, 2016", "UNICEF, \"At a glance: Morocco,\" accessed July 7, 2016", "Vitalvoices.org, \"Morocco\u2019s future depends on women,\" September 17, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
