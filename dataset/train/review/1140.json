["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on March 22, 2019", "Democratic lawmakers claim the president\u2019s proposed 2020 budget would \u201cransack\u201d or \u201cslash\u201d Medicare and Medicaid, likening it to an \u201cassault on Medicare\u201d and \u201cthe health care of seniors and families across America.\u201d Experts agree the proposed cuts to Medicaid are significant, but many of the Medicare proposals echo those of Barack Obama and wouldn\u2019t directly affect beneficiaries.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed 2020 budget includes a net $777 billion reduction in Medicaid spending and funding for the Affordable Care Act marketplace subsidies over 10 years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Those cuts would come from repealing the ACA, including the Medicaid expansion, and turning Medicaid into a block grant program. Several Democrats have misleadingly used a higher gross figure of $1.5 trillion in cuts.", "As for Medicare \u2014 a program politicians of both parties often highlight in lines of attack (see \u201cA Campaign Full of Mediscare,\u201d 2012) \u2014 those proposed spending reductions total a net $515 billion to $575 billion over 10 years, depending on how they\u2019re measured, says the budget watchdog group the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That\u2019s 5 to 5.6 percent of projected Medicare spending over the next decade. Several Democrats have used a higher figure of $845 billion, but that includes two programs that the Trump administration proposes moving to other parts of the budget.", "Notably, several of the Medicare proposals in Trump\u2019s budget are similar to cost-cutting measures Obama had espoused when he was president \u2014 some of which Republicans lambasted at the time.\u00a0Readers of FactCheck.org may remember repeated claims from GOP lawmakers in years past that the Affordable Care Act would \u201ccut\u201d or \u201cgut\u201d Medicare by $500 billion or $716 billion\u00a0\u201cat the expense of the elderly.\u201d Now, the shoe is on the other party\u2019s foot, with Democrats claiming these spending growth reductions would harm Medicare.", "At least one of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals \u2014 a change in out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage \u2014 would directly affect beneficiaries, causing some to pay less and others to pay more. And one lawmaker\u2019s office argues that Trump\u2019s proposed cuts, which include a repeal of the ACA, can\u2019t be compared to many of Obama\u2019s, because the cuts proposed by Obama were part of\u00a0the ACA, resulting in an\u00a0overall increase in health care spending and reduction in the uninsured.", "It\u2019s important to note that a president\u2019s budget proposal is more a symbolic statement of priorities than something Congress would vote on.\u00a0Indeed, Congress passed \u2014 and Trump signed \u2014 a very different bipartisan\u00a0two-year spending bill\u00a0a few days prior to the White House releasing its\u00a0FY 2019 budget proposal.", "Let\u2019s take a look at what the president proposed.", "Democrats have pointed out that Trump, as a presidential candidate, said he would \u201csave Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts,\u201d and yet his budget proposal includes spending reductions to all three.", "\u201cAfter exploding the deficit with his GOP tax scam for the rich, President Trump is once again trying to ransack Medicare, Medicaid and the health care of seniors and families across America,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement to the Associated Press.", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at a media availability on March 12: \u201cThe Trump budget calls for a $1.5 trillion cut in Medicaid, $850 billion cut in Medicare.\u201d Schumer called it \u201chypocritical.\u201d", "\u201cPresident Trump: \u2018I will not cut Medicare or Social Security.\u2019 President Trump\u2019s budget slashes it,\u201d Schumer said.", "Sen. Richard Blumenthal called the budget an \u201cassault on Medicare,\u201d while Sen.

Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said CRFB\u2019s characterizations of some Trump policies mimicking those of Obama were \u201cgenerally correct.\u201d", "Proposals to reduce post-acute care payments ($110 billion reduction over 10 years) and to cut payments for bad debt ($40 billion) are similar to Obama policies, CRFB said. In fact, Obama\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget included nearly $100 billion in reduced post-acute care payments.", "The Trump budget\u2019s proposal to \u201cequalize site-of-service payments,\u201d meaning pay the same for outpatient services\u00a0whether in a\u00a0doctor\u2019s offices or other facilities ($160 billion), and to change graduate medical education payments ($50 billion) are expansions of Obama proposals, CRFB said. Van de Water noted in a post on CBPP\u2019s website that the site-of-service measure was similar to one from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent congressional entity that advises Congress.", "\u201cThe proposals are similar to those in last year\u2019s [fiscal 2019] budget,\u201d Van de Water told us in an email. \u201cExcept for the proposed changes in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and perhaps the medical liability reform, the proposals would not directly affect beneficiaries.\u201d", "Both of the budget groups were critical of Trump\u2019s overall budget, with CRFB writing it was \u201criddled with gimmicks and unrealistic assumptions\u201d and CBPP calling it \u201ca disturbing vision\u201d that would \u201cmake poverty more widespread, widen inequality and racial disparities, and increase the ranks of the uninsured.\u201d CBPP, however, didn\u2019t mention Medicare in that assessment.", "Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and director of its Medicare policy program,\u00a0also agreed that many of Trump\u2019s Medicare spending proposals were similar to his predecessor\u2019s: \u201cIn a sense, yes, they are similar in that they generally aim to lower the growth in Medicare spending by reducing payments to providers, though the specific proposals differ,\u201d she said in an email.", "One proposal that would directly affect beneficiaries is a change to out-of-pocket spending in Medicare Part D ($65 billion over 10 years).", "Van de Water explained\u00a0in a post on the CBPP website: \u201cThe proposed changes in the Medicare Part D drug benefit would reduce out-of-pocket costs for some beneficiaries, including those with the highest spending, while raising costs for others. The budget would limit beneficiaries\u2019 annual out-of-pocket drug spending and eliminate cost sharing on generic drugs for recipients of Medicare\u2019s low-income drug subsidy (LIS), which could improve LIS recipients\u2019 access to care and promote medication adherence. At the same time, the budget would\u00a0raise\u00a0Part D premiums and charge more to beneficiaries whose drug spending is high but below the threshold at which catastrophic coverage kicks in.\u201d", "Neuman too, said: \u201cWhen it comes to out-of-pocket spending on drug costs, the Administration\u2019s budget is a double-edged sword; it helps some, but increases costs for others.\u201d She said most of the proposals in the budget \u201cwould reduce the growth in spending for hospitals and other health care providers, without directly affecting beneficiaries,\u201d though it was \u201cvery hard to predict\u201d precisely how the proposals would affect seniors.", "For comparison, Obama\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget included $401 billion in Medicare spending reductions over 10 years, but it called for a $39 billion increase in Medicaid spending, according to CRFB\u2019s breakdown.", "Henry V. Connelly, deputy communications director for Speaker Pelosi,\u00a0told us that Medicare advocacy groups had \u201cconcluded [Trump\u2019s] cuts would indeed hurt Medicare beneficiaries.\u201d He pointed to a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0from the Center for Medicare Advocacy and the Medicare Rights Center: \u201cAmong other things, the administration\u2019s proposal would curtail Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 appeal rights and increase the amount many would pay for needed prescriptions,\u201d the groups said. \u201cIt would also jeopardize beneficiary access to critical services by significantly cutting provider payments.\u201d", "Schumer\u2019s office told us that while Obama\u2019s proposed budgets also called for cutting provider payments, that was in the context of the ACA and an overall expansion of health care coverage. \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s proposed reductions in Medicare spending aren\u2019t being reinvested into health care programs,\u201d Schumer\u2019s office said.", "The ACA included a $716 billion reduction\u00a0in the future growth of Medicare spending over 10 years, according to a 2012 assessment by the Congressional Budget Office, with most of that ($415 billion) in reductions in the growth of payments to hospitals. Schumer\u2019s office said \u201cproviders supported the ACA because they were able to now treat a significant influx of newly insured patients instead of providing uncompensated care.\u201d", "There\u2019s support for that.\u00a0Chip Kahn, president and chief executive officer of the Federation of American Hospitals, criticized Trump\u2019s budget for including \u201carbitrary and blunt Medicare cuts to hospitals who care for the nation\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d saying it was \u201cno time to gut Medicare.\u201d", "But in March 2010, when Congress was debating the ACA, Kahn said in a letter to then-Sen. Harry Reid that the legislation would expand coverage to millions of Americans and provide \u201ca framework for health care delivery reform.\u201d He wrote:\u00a0\u201cThat is why hospitals will forgo $155 billion in Medicare\u00a0and Medicaid payments over 10 years as part of a shared sacrifice to bring about the benefits that health reform will deliver to all Americans.\u201d", "So, the FAH supported cuts to the growth of hospital payments as a trade-off for a reduction in the uninsured.", "It\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s proposed budget doesn\u2019t offer that. Instead, it would reduce Medicaid spending and eliminate the ACA premium subsidies for a net $777 billion reduction over a decade. Together with proposed reductions in Medicare spending, that comes to about $1.35 trillion less in future Medicare and Medicaid spending.", "But lumping them together also glosses over the fact that several of the administration\u2019s Medicare proposals bear some resemblance to measures Democrats once supported and Republicans criticized.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
