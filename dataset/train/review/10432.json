West.", "In the video, it does appear that a pedestrian struck the back of Fields\u2019 car with an object. But it isn\u2019t clear from that video or others shared by the media that the driver had slowed, or that he was \u201cbehaving normally\u201d prior to that. A longer version of the same video clip shows the car speeding down the street toward the crowd.", "A day before it published the video, the Department of Memes on Aug. 12 posted a story that claimed: \u201cLocal police think he was terrified of leftist protesters who were blocking traffic in the street when he accelerated his vehicle into the crowd, fatally injuring a yet unidentified heavyset 32-year-old woman.\u201d", "Lorenz also tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m at the police station now interviewing officers and other witnesses. Every witness here claims the act was deliberate.\u201d", "A day later, Lorenz explained that she deleted her tweet saying several officers believed the driver \u201cwasn\u2019t malicious\u201d because \u201capparently a bunch of 4chan trolls are taking it out of context and mischaracterizing this info.\u201d", "Indeed, police initially charged Fields with one count of second-degree murder for causing the death of Heather Heyer, 32, of Charlottesville. Nineteen others suffered injuries in the wreck. In addition to second-degree murder, Fields was charged with three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and-run. Five additional felony counts were added later in the week, including two more counts of malicious wounding and three counts of aggravated malicious wounding.", "According to Charlottesville police, a Dodge Challenger driven by Fields sped down Fourth Street and caused a chain-reaction accident that resulted in vehicles being pushed into a crowd of pedestrians.", "Charlottesville police, Aug. 13: The three-vehicle crash occurred on 4th Street. A Dodge Challenger was traveling south on 4th Street at a high rate of speed when it rear-ended a sedan headed south on 4th Street. The impact of that crash pushed the sedan into the minivan in front of it. The minivan had slowed for a crowd a people crossing through the intersection. The impact of the crash pushed the vehicles into the crowd of pedestrians. The Dodge Challenger fled the scene, but was located and stopped a short time later by Charlottesville Police.", "According to Virginia code, aggravated malicious wounding occurs if someone wounds another person or \u201cby any means causes bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill.\u201d In other words, by its very definition, the charge against Fields means police believe Fields acted with willful intent to injure or kill.", "Department of Memes website. \u201cVIDEO: Protesters Attacked Charlottesville Driver\u2019s Car With Baseball Bat.\u201d 13 Aug 2017.", "Department of Memes. \u201cAbout\u201d page.
