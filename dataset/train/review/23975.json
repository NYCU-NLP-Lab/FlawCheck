Even for a Washington insider, it takes a special kind of dishonesty to publicly oppose Obamacare while personally profiting from it.\"", "Given Jolly\u2019s stance to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it would indeed be awkward if he made $80,000 lobbying for the law. We decided to check the paperwork on this one.", "Peters makes a call on call center", "Jolly worked as an aide and general counsel for the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young for more than a decade before becoming a lobbyist in 2007 for Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates.

The center began taking calls for enrollment assistance on Oct. 1.", "Neither Jolly nor Faneuil would further specify Jolly\u2019s role with the company, although Jolly\u2019s campaign emphasized that the Washington call center contract wasn\u2019t awarded to Faneuil until March 2013, when Jolly was no longer being paid.", "Peters didn\u2019t connect her own dots in the ensuing days.
