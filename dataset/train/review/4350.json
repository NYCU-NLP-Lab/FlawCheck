["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on March 17, 2021", "Hall of Fame boxer Marvelous Marvin Hagler \u201cdied on March 13 of natural causes,\u201d according to a statement posted on his official website. In a Facebook post, his widow, Kay Hagler, wrote that his death was not the result of a COVID-19 vaccination, as social media posts have claimed without evidence.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "More than\u00a0half a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain \u2014 or no side effects at all. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said, these vaccines \u201chave undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\u201d", "A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated. Approximately 5 per million people vaccinated have experienced anaphylaxis after a COVID-19 vaccine, according\u00a0to the CDC.", "To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn\u2019t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.", "There is evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in male adolescents and young adults.", "Based on data collected through August 2021, the reporting rates of either condition in the U.S. are highest in males 16 to 17 years old after the second dose (105.9 cases per million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), followed by 12- to 15-year-old males (70.7 cases per million). The rate for 18- to 24-year-old males was 52.4 cases and 56.3 cases per million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively.", "Health officials have emphasized that vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated \u201cresponded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly.\u201d", "The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an\u00a0increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, especially in women ages 30\u00a0to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and\u00a0include\u00a0severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.", "According to the CDC, TTS has occurred in around 4 people per million doses administered. As of early April,\u00a0the syndrome has been confirmed in 60 cases, including nine deaths, after more than 18.6 million doses of the J&J vaccine. Although TTS remains rare, because of the availability of mRNA vaccines, which are not associated with this serious side effect, the FDA on May 5 limited authorized use of the J&J vaccine to adults who either couldn\u2019t get one of the other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines because of medical or access reasons, or only wanted a J&J vaccine for protection against the disease. Several months earlier, on Dec. 16, 2021,\u00a0the CDC had recommended the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots over J&J\u2019s.", "The J&J vaccine has also been linked to an increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks nerve cells.\u00a0Most people\u00a0who develop GBS fully recover, although some have permanent nerve damage and the condition can be fatal.", "Safety surveillance data suggest that compared with the mRNA vaccines, which have not been linked to GBS, the J&J vaccine is associated with 15.5 additional GBS cases per million doses of vaccine in the three weeks following vaccination. Most reported cases following J&J vaccination have occurred in men 50 years old and older.", "Link to this", "There is no evidence that the death of 66-year-old Marvelous Marvin Hagler, a former middleweight boxing champion, was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine, as some have claimed or suggested on social media. It\u2019s the second time this year that we have written about unsubstantiated claims that the vaccines led to a famous Black athlete\u2019s death.", "Hagler\u2019s wife, Kay Hagler, announced on Facebook March 13 that he passed unexpectedly that day. Less than 48 hours later, she went back to the popular platform to refute online rumors about how her late husband died.", "\u201cFor sure wasn\u2019t the vaccine that caused his death,\u201d she wrote in a March 15 post on Hagler\u2019s verified fan club page. \u201cMy baby left in peace with his [usual] smile and now is not the time to talk nonsense.\u201d", "TMZ Sports reported that James Hagler, one of the boxing legend\u2019s sons, said his father passed away after he had gone to the hospital for chest pains and trouble breathing. A message later posted on Marvelous Marvin Hagler\u2019s official website said he died \u201cof natural causes near his home in New Hampshire.\u201d", "No other details were provided in the brief statement.", "Many social media claims linking Hagler\u2019s death to a COVID-19 vaccination were based solely on a post from Thomas Hearns, one of his most famous boxing rivals.", "The day Hagler died, Hearns \u2014 in a since-deleted post \u2014 took to Instagram to encourage people to pray for his friend and former opponent, whom he said had suffered complications after a vaccination.", "\u201cA real true warrior Pray for the king and his family .. he\u2019s in ICU fighting the after effects of the vaccine!\u201d Hearns wrote \u2014 without disclosing the source of that information.", "In her Facebook post, Kay Hagler never actually confirmed whether her husband had been vaccinated against COVID-19.", "In a follow-up post that also was deleted, Hearns said that his original post about Hagler was not intended to be an \u201canti vaccine campaign.\u201d", "Yet that\u2019s exactly how some have used his post on social media.", "\u201cThe vaccine killed Marvin Hagler,\u201d one Twitter user wrote in a post including a screenshot of Hearns\u2019 comments on Instagram, for example.", "In another post referencing Hearns\u2019 original comments, a Facebook user wrote, in part: \u201cMarvin Hagler passed away at age of 66 after receiving the Covid vaccine. When will people wake up. Thousands are dying and tens of thousands are being injured by the vaccine.\u201d", "But even if Hagler was vaccinated before his death, it\u2019s wrong to assume the vaccine caused his passing. SciCheck has written before about that faulty reasoning.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized that the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are safe and effective.", "The CDC says common vaccination side effects include fatigue, headache, chills, fever and nausea, as well as pain and swelling at the site of the injection.", "But more severe allergic reactions are \u201crare\u201d and have \u201coccurred in approximately 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated\u201d in the U.S. That\u2019s based on events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the CDC says. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, regardless of whether a reaction that occurs after immunization is thought to be linked to the vaccine.", "Further, as of March 16, CDC and Food and Drug Administration physicians had investigated all 1,913 VAERS reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine and found \u201cno evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.\u201d", "At the time, more than 109 million COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered in the U.S.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
