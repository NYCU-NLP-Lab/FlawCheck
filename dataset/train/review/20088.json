The account's user appeared to take the view that Breitbart is a hub of neo-Nazism and racism. However, while Breitbart is an openly politically conservative web site, classification of it as definitively anti-Semitic or racist is subjective. In a November 2016 Los Angeles Times profile, company executives firmly rejected that characterization, saying that several senior-level employees (as well as the late Andrew Breitbart, its founder) are Jewish:", "[Breitbart executive and Donald Trump campaign operative Steve] Bannon\u2019s appointment to the White House has been harshly criticized by members of both parties who have latched on to some of Breitbart News\u2019 more outlandish headlines to denounce him as an anti-Semite and the site itself as white nationalist ... Breitbart leaders have gone on the counteroffensive, calling the attacks false and threatening a lawsuit against \u201ca major media company,\u201d which it has not identified. \u201cWe think we were influential in the election and people are resentful of it,\u201d said [president Larry] Solov, noting that he is Jewish, as was Breitbart. \u201cWe are a nationalist website. How the word \u2018white\u2019 got tacked on is part of a coordinated media smear campaign,\u201d said Marlow. \u201cWe like that we have a border \u2014 we don\u2019t want to cede our country to unelected global bureaucrats. It has nothing to do with skin tone.\u201d Breitbart employs a number of minorities and women in prominent editorial positions. In a recent article, its London editor in chief Raheem Kassam praised Bannon for hiring a \u201cbrown guy\u201d from \u201ca Muslim family to run his London operation.\u201d The company has also been accused of being part of the alt-right \u2014 the informal political cohort often described as militantly conservative \u2014 after Bannon was quoted in Mother Jones saying Breitbart was a platform for the movement. But company leaders deny they are actually part of the alt-right. \u201cWe have done a number of articles on the alt-right, but that doesn\u2019t make us alt-right,\u201d Solov said.", "The user responsible for the spread of the e-mail shared a second screenshot:", "@slpng_giants @HarryandDavid Here are screenshots of my Inbox from the emails from Harry and David: pic.twitter.com/tTf01T8gPt \u2014 Jeff (@benthere536) December 6, 2016", "The letter, which was addressed to a customer service inbox (not a company public relations account), read:", "I would love to send Harry & David gifts to friends and family this holiday season. However, your company is advertising on the white supremacist neo-Nazi website, Breitbart. This site is the antithesis of everything I value and stand for.

It originated with an account younger than a month old, tweeting to near exclusion about companies advertising with Breitbart. A Harry & David representative authorized to speak on the matter explained that the company had never had an advertising relationship with Breitbart, and did little advertising to begin with.", "A final possibility is that an unauthorized or third-party advertisement for Harry & David appeared on Breitbart, a situation over which the company has little control.", "Ng, David. \u00a0 \"Inside Breitbart's Westside L.A.
