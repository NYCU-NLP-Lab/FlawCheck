The same survey cites an 8.4 percent uninsured rate for Californians under 65 years of age.", "The \u2018all ages\u2019 uninsured rate is slightly lower because it includes the 65 and older population, the vast majority of which has health insurance through Medicare.", "The governor\u2019s office also cited several sources as evidence that California\u2019s uninsured rate has reached \"a historic low.\"", "Those include a health care almanac maintained by the California Health Care Foundation.

That rate is for all ages in California.", "When discussing this topic, many researchers cite the uninsured rate for Californians under 65, which was slightly higher at 8.4 percent.

A health care almanac shows the state\u2019s uninsured rate for Californians under 65 hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before dropping sharply in recent years. Its records go back to 1987 when that rate was 17.6 percent.", "Researchers who study California\u2019s uninsured rate say this measurement was not closely tracked before the 1980s, but said the rate was certainly not lower in past decades.
