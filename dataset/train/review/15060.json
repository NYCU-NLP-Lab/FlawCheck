Such initiatives have been stalled in the House, currently controlled by the Republicans, and to an extent the Senate, where the GOP minority has tools it can use to block legislation.", "So Obama sought to paint congressional Republicans as being derelict in their duty by leaving town for the summer recess.", "\"House Republicans actually got together this week and voted to sue me for taking actions on my own,\" Obama said. \"And then they left town for the month without settling a bunch of unfinished business that matters to working families across America. \u2026 And when they return from vacation next month, instead of trying to pass partisan bills on party lines, hopefully we can come together with the sense of common purpose that you expect.
