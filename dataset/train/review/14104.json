I have to applaud the special effects \u2014 the first time I saw it I was shocked. This was NOT a reenactment of a real story, Not an advertisement and Not for marketing of another film.", "A response video explains how effects like the ones shown in \"Exhibit B-5\" were created:", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
