["One of the posts, archived here, has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook and claims that \u201cthe US health dept chief J Anthony said that salons have been responsible for almost 50% deaths\u201d, adding that \u201cBarber's salon poses the biggest risk factor for Corona!

The US Secretary for Health and Human Services is Alex Azar and the closest health professional with\u00a0a similar name is Dr Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).", "Fauci has been leading the battle against COVID-19 in the US and has stressed the need for social distancing at all times.
