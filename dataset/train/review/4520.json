["Two different claims about Maharani Radhika Raje Gaekwad of Baroda have been making the rounds on social media recently. The first is that Forbes declared her the most beautiful woman out of all the Indian royal families. The second is about her making the decision to leave behind her royal life to become a Jain Sadhvi. A few photos of Maharani Radhika Raje along with a video of a woman are being circulated along with these claims. In the video, a woman wearing a white-coloured sari and gold ornaments. Her hair is being shaved off in what looks like a religious ceremony. Facebook user Anil Chetan claimed in an August 12 post that the clip featured none other than Raje. By the time this article was written, his post had been shared 1,600 times and the video had been viewed more than 2 lakh times.
