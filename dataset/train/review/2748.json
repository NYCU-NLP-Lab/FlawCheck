["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on May 17, 2016", "For at least five years, Donald Trump has been making false claims about hairspray and its impact on the ozone layer. Most recently, the likely Republican presidential nominee made comments at a campaign rally in West Virginia:", "Hairspray is made up of chemicals that make hair stiff and a propellant. Hairspray and many other aerosols used chlorofluorocarbons as propellants until many major countries began phasing out these chemicals after the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. CFCs are potent ozone-depleting substances.", "In the place of CFCs, many countries started using hydrochlorofluorocarbons\u00a0and hydrofluorocarbons\u00a0as propellants in aerosols. CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs are all potent greenhouse gases. But HCFCs are about 5 percent to 10 percent as potent at depleting ozone as CFCs, while HFCs are generally not thought of as ozone-depleting substances. Though still used in other forms, HCFCs were phased out of aerosols in the United States in 1994, while HFCs still remain in use.", "Trump has made claims about hairspray and the ozone layer at least three times. Back in 2011 in Sydney, he implied the \u201ceight-inch concrete floors\u201d and \u201ceight-inch concrete walls\u201d of Trump Tower would prevent hairspray from \u201cdestroying the ozone that\u2019s 400 miles up in the air.\u201d In December 2015, at a campaign rally in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, Trump also said he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink anything gets out\u201d of his \u201csealed\u201d apartment when he uses hairspray.", "On May 5, 2016, at a campaign rally in Charleston, Trump implied that the regulations on hairspray and coal mining are both unwarranted. At the rally, an official from the West Virginia Coal Association endorsed Trump and presented him with a hard hat. Trump tried on the hat, which prompted him to talk about his hair:", "Trump, May 5: Give me a little spray. \u2026 You know you\u2019re not allowed to use hairspray anymore because it affects the ozone, you know that, right? I said, you mean to tell me, cause you know hairspray\u2019s not like it used to be, it used to be real good. \u2026 Today you put the hairspray on, it\u2019s good for 12 minutes, right. \u2026 So if I take hairspray and I spray it in my apartment, which is all sealed, you\u2019re telling me that affects the ozone layer? \u201cYes.\u201d I say no way folks. No way. No way. That\u2019s like a lot of the rules and regulations you people have in the mines, right, it\u2019s the same kind of stuff.", "We contacted Trump\u2019s campaign for comment, but it hasn\u2019t responded. If someone does get back to us, we will update this report accordingly. In the next sections, we\u2019ll outline how and why many countries agreed to phase out CFCs and replace them with HCFCs and HFCs. We\u2019ll also explain why using hairspray inside wouldn\u2019t prevent ozone-depleting substances from reaching the atmosphere, as Trump claimed.", "First developed in the 1930s under the trade name Freon, CFCs were originally assumed to be safe for the environment. For this reason, CFCs made their way into a slew of household items, from the coolants used in refrigerators to Styrofoam to\u00a0aerosols like hairspray.", "But in the 1970s researchers began questioning the safety of these chemicals. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina, chemists at the University of California, Irvine at the time, discovered that CFCs were capable of depleting the ozone layer \u2014 winning the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995 for their work.", "Then in the 1980s, scientists realized the ice particles in clouds over the Artic and Antarctic sped up the process Molina and Rowland\u00a0originally discovered. Joseph Farman, a geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey at the time, and researchers at NASA\u00a0found a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica that was roughly the size of the United States.", "How do CFCs deplete the ozone layer? When a CFC molecule makes it to the stratosphere, solar radiation breaks it down, leaving behind a lone chlorine atom. The chlorine atom (Cl\u2013) then reacts with an ozone molecule (O3), leaving behind chlorine oxide (ClO) and oxygen (O2). In fact, Molina discovered that one chlorine atom could start a chain reaction that would lead\u00a0to the break up of around 100,000 ozone molecules.", "First off, a CFC molecule doesn\u2019t have 400 miles to travel to reach the ozone layer, as Trump claimed in 2011. About 90 percent of the ozone layer can be found between 6\u00a0to 10 miles above the earth\u2019s surface, with the last 10 percent of the ozone layer extending as far as 30 miles above the surface. The stratosphere spans 5.5 to 30 miles above the earth\u2019s surface.", "Second, a depleted ozone layer is no small matter. A weakened ozone layer leads to an increase in ultraviolet\u00a0radiation, which then brings about higher rates of skin cancer, cataracts and immune system problems in human populations. Increased UV radiation can also disrupt vital processes in plants and marine ecosystems.", "The gravity of the issue prompted policymakers globally to sign the Montreal Protocol on Sept. 16, 1987. The agreement took effect on Jan. 1, 1989, and aimed to reduce the production and use of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. However, the protocol has been amended six times to take into consideration new scientific information and accelerate reductions in CFC and HCFC use. First signed by 46 countries, the protocol now has close to 200 signatories, including the United States.", "In 2014, five international entities, including the United Nations Environmental Program and NASA, published a report that found actions \u201ctaken under the Montreal Protocol have led to decreases in the atmospheric abundance of controlled ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), and are enabling the return of the ozone layer toward 1980 levels.\u201d In fact, the report states the recovery of the ozone layer is \u201cexpected to occur before midcentury in midlatitudes and the Arctic, and somewhat later for the Antarctic ozone hole.\u201d", "In short, the propellants used in hairspray and other substances, CFCs in particular, have been banned. But the chemicals that make hair stiff weren\u2019t subject to these regulations. And CFCs were banned for good reason, despite Trump\u2019s implication. Regulations implemented with the Montreal Protocol appear to be reversing the damage done to the ozone layer by CFCs in hairspray and other substances.", "While hairspray no longer uses CFCs to propel the stiffening agent out of the can, it does use other chemicals as propellants that are potent greenhouse gases \u2014 namely HFCs.", "In fact, the aforementioned 2014 report also found that \u201cclimate benefits of the Montreal Protocol could be significantly offset by projected emissions of HFCs used to replace\u201d ozone-depleting substances.", "Today HFC use (in hairspray and otherwise) \u201cmakes a small contribution\u201d to greenhouse gas emissions each year, explain the report authors. But emissions from HFCs \u201care currently growing at a rate of about 7% per year\u201d and increasing demand could result in HFC emissions reaching levels \u201cnearly as high as the peak emission of CFCs\u201d by 2050.", "To be clear, CFCs are detrimental to the environment for at least two reasons \u2014 they efficiently deplete ozone and they are potent greenhouse gases. That is, they contribute to global warming. HFCs, on the other hand, do not contribute to ozone depletion directly and efficiently like CFCs. But they still negatively impact the climate as greenhouse gases.", "Margaret M. Hurwitz, an atmospheric scientist at NASA, and others found that HFCs may indirectly contribute to ozone depletion by modifying atmospheric temperatures and circulation.", "Speaking about her Oct. 22, 2015, study published in Geophysical Research Letters, Hurwitz told Phys.org that her results don\u2019t suggest \u201cHFCs are an existential threat to the ozone layer.\u201d Still, \u201cHFCs are, in fact, weak ozone-depleting substances,\u201d she said.", "Hurwitz also explained to us by email that \u201c[p]er unit mass, CFC-11 causes about 400 times more depletion of the protective stratospheric ozone than the HFCs, while HCFC-22 causes 8 times more ozone depletion\u201d than HFCs, for example. So the effect of HFCs on the ozone layer is significantly less than that of CFCs, but it\u2019s not zero.", "In addition, Steve Montzka, a chemist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reiterated to us by email, \u201cIt was never the stiffening agent in the spray that caused the problem [with the ozone layer], it was the propellant.\u201d We can\u2019t comment on whether \u201chairspray\u2019s not like it used to be,\u201d as Trump claimed. But we can say changes in hairspray quality wouldn\u2019t be a result of the replacement of CFCs with HFCs due to regulations on the former.", "We also asked Montzka whether using hairspray inside would prevent CFCs or HFCs from having an effect on the ozone layer compared with\u00a0using it outside, as Trump claimed. \u201cIt makes absolutely no difference!\u201d he said. If you spray these chemicals \u201cinside your house or apartment, it will eventually make it outside.\u201d", "\u201cThese gases cannot and are not confined to the kitchen or bedroom; they mix, diffuse, and are moved out of the local release area to be transported throughout the lower atmosphere (over months) before they are transported upward to the stratosphere,\u201d where the ozone layer is located, David Fahey, a physicist at NOAA, told us\u00a0in an email.", "In sum, the \u201ceight-inch concrete floors\u201d and \u201ceight-inch concrete walls\u201d of Trump Tower wouldn\u2019t prevent the propellants in hairspray from reaching the ozone layer, which is 6\u00a0to 30 miles, not 400 miles, above the earth\u2019s surface. This means Trump\u2019s hairspray use over the years has either directly (through CFCs) or indirectly (HFCs) contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer, albeit to a very small extent, despite what he has claimed.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6af2c285-aaa5-474f-80f0-22e5d81b5481", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
