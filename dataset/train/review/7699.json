["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 10, 2017", "Q: Has the U.S. Supreme Court issued a warrant for the arrest of one of Barack Obama\u2019s treasury secretaries?", "A: No. The person named in a fictional story doesn\u2019t even exist.", "The U.S. Supreme Court currently has 50 cases on the docket for the term that began in October. None of them directly concerns the Treasury Department.", "But two deceptive websites have fabricated stories claiming that the nation\u2019s highest court is hearing a case about federal funds that were mishandled by the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.", "A story originally published by a website called Freedum Junkshun claims that the Supreme Court has issued \u201cits first bench warrant ever\u201d for the arrest of a man formerly in charge of Obama\u2019s Treasury Department. Facebook users flagged it as potentially false news.", "In addition, a subsequent story from a related website called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense says that the same man has since died under \u201csuspicious circumstances.\u201d", "Both stories are attributed to the same writer with the name Flagg Eagleton, and both websites describe their work as satirical fiction. Other websites, though, have republished the stories without any kind of disclaimer.", "According to the story posted on freedumjunkshun.com, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch said that they can\u2019t rule on the case until they hear the \u201cin-person testimony of the man in charge at the time, Donald M. Allard.\u201d", "However, no one by that name has ever been secretary of the Treasury Department. The two secretaries who served under Obama were Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew.", "The Supreme Court also doesn\u2019t hear testimony. It\u2019s an appeals court that reviews the rulings of lower courts and makes its decisions based on its interpretation of the law and the arguments made by lawyers.", "And the follow-up story from thelastlineofdefense.org reports that Allard recently died under \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d in Washington, D.C. But the photo posted with the story is actually from a 2011 shooting at a motel in Orange County, California.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Supreme Court of the United States.
