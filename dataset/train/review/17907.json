["By Angelo Fichera and Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 11, 2021", "One America News Network recently spotlighted one man\u2019s analysis that wrongly suggests precinct-level voting data in Georgia proved a computer algorithm was used to swing the election to President Joe Biden. A hand tally of paper ballots confirmed the election outcome, one of many indications the claim is false.", "The latest example in a string of bogus claims suggesting that the 2020 election was stolen via computer software comes from a dubious One America News Network report, which presents an analysis purportedly proving that precinct-level election results in Georgia were \u201cimpossible\u201d without the use of an algorithm.", "The video, now circulating on Facebook, highlights one person\u2019s questionable analysis showing that former President Donald Trump got the same share of the votes across multiple precincts in Fulton County, Georgia, during specific reporting times.", "But experts say the conclusion being offered in the video is bunk.", "OAN\u2019s Christina Bobb tells viewers that Edward Solomon, a \u201cmathematician\u201d who \u201ctook a closer look at the election results at the precinct level,\u201d determined that \u201ccomputer software must have used an algorithm to change the votes.\u201d The algorithm was used \u201clong enough to change the advantage,\u201d she says.", "While the conservative outlet refers to him as an \u201cexpert mathematician\u201d \u2014 and the notoriously unreliable website the Gateway Pundit referred to him as a \u201cRenowned Mathematician\u201d in sharing OAN\u2019s report \u2014 Solomon\u2019s exact credentials aren\u2019t clear.", "In a document on Scribd making similar allegations of fraud in Pennsylvania, he claims to \u201chave devoted my life to the study of numbers, fractions and ratios, and have written academic materials on the subject.\u201d", "According to his social media profiles, Solomon has been associated with Stony Brook University. A university spokesperson told us that he attended classes as a math major for various terms between 2008 and 2015, but did not get a degree.", "Solomon did not respond to emails or Facebook messages asking for his credentials, and where exactly he got his data.", "Solomon maintains a YouTube channel where he has posted many videos purporting to prove election fraud. Among his older videos, too, are calls that he made to the radio show of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. In one, Solomon alleged that the gunman in the fatal 2013 shooting at the Washington Navy Yard had been identified online before the shooting even took place.", "As we said, we don\u2019t know where Solomon got the data that he showed in the OAN clip. It didn\u2019t come from Edison Research, which provides vote tabulation data to the media, the firm told us. And it doesn\u2019t match the data available from Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State. But even if it is an accurate snapshot of precinct-level vote entries on election night, it doesn\u2019t prove that there was fraud committed by an algorithm, experts say.", "\u201cThat several precincts would show exactly the same vote shares at different times is not at all surprising,\u201d said Philip Stark, associate dean of the division of mathematical and physical sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. Stark also serves on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Board of Advisors.", "Noting that it was hard to fully assess Solomon\u2019s claims because the origins of the data aren\u2019t clear, Stark\u00a0said in an email that precincts showing the same vote shares would be even more expected by incorporating multiple snapshots of time (as Solomon does). How polarized or close to evenly split an area is could also affect the chances of that occurring, he said.", "For instance, Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, leans Democratic and in the OAN video Solomon cited a number of precincts that skew heavily Democratic. In our review of those precincts\u2019 final election results, the 2020 vote shares were not markedly different from those in the 2016 presidential election. While the split was similar, Trump actually fared a little better in 2020 in many of those precincts.", "In precinct 10J, for example, Hillary Clinton earned about 96% of the total vote in 2016 compared to Trump\u2019s 3%. In 2020, President Joe Biden received 94% of the vote in that precinct while Trump received 5%.", "\u201cIt seems like [Solomon] may have sifted through the early Fulton County data \u2026 and picked out entries that have the proportion \u2018pattern\u2019 [he] dreamed up, using teensy numbers that are utterly inconsequential,\u201d Charleen Adams, a research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has written about the misleading use of statistics in election fraud claims, told us by email.", "There are other problems with the claim, too.", "Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting systems manager, said in a phone interview that Solomon\u2019s claim \u201cshows a basic misunderstanding of how vote counts work.\u201d", "In order for an algorithm to tamper with votes, he said, it would have to access both the election management system (EMS), which tabulates the votes, and the election night reporting system (ENR), which publishes the results.", "The EMS is not connected to the internet, Sterling said. So there would be no way for a computer running a nefarious algorithm to reach it.", "Ryan Macias, former acting director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s Voting System Testing and Certification Program, also pointed out in a phone interview that Georgia\u2019s audit \u2014 which included a hand tally of the paper ballots \u2014 and recount further disprove the claim that an algorithm was used to steal the election for Biden. The counts ultimately confirmed the originally reported election outcome.", "\u201cThat is the verification that the system is correct,\u201d Macias said.", "Stark agreed that the audit undermined the theory of an algorithm manipulating the votes. He was one of dozens of experts who signed a letter in November saying that there was no substantial evidence put forward to support the allegation that the 2020 election had been rigged.", "That said, Stark said he and other experts do have actual security concerns, and election systems \u2014 including in Georgia \u2014 can be improved to engender more confidence in the process. (For example, he advocates that hand-marked ballots be used in place of the touchscreen tablets, or ballot-marking devices, that print out a voter\u2019s selection on a paper with a barcode that is then scanned for counting. Ballot-marking devices should be reserved for voters who need that assistance, he contends.)", "However, those concerns are not unique to the 2020 election, he said, and they are not the same as baseless claims that algorithms were used to commit massive, wide-scale fraud.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
