Among them: Harry Alford, president and chief executive officer of the D.C.-based National Black Chamber of Commerce.", "Alford, who spoke in Milwaukee in 2008, said at one point:", "\"I want to thank the Lord for our Constitution. I also want to thank the NRA for its legacy. The National Rifle Association was started, founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan.\"", "Well known as a defender of the right to bear arms, the 5 million-member NRA does describe itself as \"America's longest-standing civil rights organization.\"", "But is that why it was founded?", "Not even close.", "What the NRA says", "Here\u2019s what the NRA says on its website about its founding:", "Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to \"promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,\" according to a magazine editorial written by Church.", "After being granted a charter by the State of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA's first president.", "An important facet of the NRA's creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York State, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held.", "No mention of religious leaders, slaves or the KKK.", "Brief histories of the NRA by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post contain no such mentions, either. We called and emailed the NRA to inquire about Alford\u2019s claim, but the group offered no response.

Williams returned home to Monroe, N.C., after serving in World War II, the Ku Klux Klan was \"beating, lynching and murdering blacks at will.\"", "In 1957, Williams got a charter from the NRA, founded the Black Armed Guard and repeatedly thwarted KKK attacks, Coulter wrote. She didn't say whether the NRA played a role in the guard's fighting the Klan.", "Again, no reference to religious leaders or slaves. And the fighting against the KKK -- whether it involved the NRA or not -- would have occurred more than 85 years after the NRA\u2019s founding.", "3.
