["By Robert Farley", "Posted on July 22, 2016", "Donald Trump doubled down on his baseless insinuation that a photograph published by the National Enquirer shows Ted Cruz\u2019s father with \u201ccrazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast.\u201d", "A day after accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Trump touted the national tabloid as a credible source worthy of a Pulitzer Prize, and said the newspaper would not have run the photo if it was \u201cwrong.\u201d Moreover, Trump said, the Cruz camp \u201cnever denied\u201d that it was Rafael Cruz in the photo with the man who assassinated President John F. Kennedy.", "That\u2019s all nonsense.", "As we wrote on May 3, the thinly sourced story hangs largely on comments from an expert who told the paper that a photo of an unidentified man handing out pro-Fidel Castro leaflets with Oswald has \u201cmore similarity than dissimilarity\u201d with a passport photo of Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael.", "The photo expert, Mitch Goldstone, president and CEO of ScanMyPhotos, a California-based digitizing photo service, was quoted in the Enquirer story \u2014 \u201cTed Cruz Father Linked to JFK Assassination!\u201d \u2014 as saying, \u201c[I]t looks to be the same person and I can say as much with a high degree of confidence.\u201d", "Note the parsing of words.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t saying with a high degree of certainty that it is Rafael Cruz. He\u2019s saying with a high degree of certainty that it \u201clooks to be the same person.\u201d", "Goldstone told us in a phone interview that he never claimed the man in the picture with Oswald was definitely Rafael Cruz, and he called Trump\u2019s unqualified assertion that it is\u00a0Cruz \u201cstupid.\u201d\u00a0Goldstone said he compared,\u00a0by eye, the photo of the unidentified man in the picture with Oswald with a passport photo of a young Rafael Cruz, and concluded \u201cThey look pretty close.\u201d", "That\u2019s the thin reed upon which this story hangs.", "Nonetheless, Trump proclaimed in a May 3\u00a0interview on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that Cruz\u2019s \u201cfather was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald\u2019s being, you know, shot! I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous \u2026 And nobody even brings it up. I mean, they don\u2019t even talk about that, that was reported and nobody talks about it. But I think it\u2019s horrible, I think it\u2019s absolutely horrible, that a man can go and do that, what he\u2019s saying there.\u201d", "Trump later added, \u201cI mean what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before the death \u2013 before the shooting? It\u2019s horrible.\u201d", "The day after his controversial convention speech, Cruz said those comments by Trump played a role in his decision not to endorse Trump.", "\u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and who attack my father,\u201d Cruz said.", "The day after his convention speech, in remarks to supporters in Cleveland, Trump fired back at Cruz, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it.\u201d Trump then launched into a defense of an unflattering image of Cruz\u2019s wife that Trump retweeted, \u00a0as well as his comments about Cruz\u2019s father.", "\u201cAll I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer, there\u2019s a picture of him [Rafael Cruz] and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that frankly in many respects, should be very respected. They got O.J. They got Edwards. They got this. I mean, if that was the New York Times, they would have gotten Pulitzer prizes for their reporting.\u201d", "Although Trump said the photo showed the two \u201chaving breakfast,\u201d the picture in question actually shows Oswald distributing pro-Castro literature in New Orleans in August 1963, a few months prior to Kennedy\u2019s assassination in Dallas. According to the Miami Herald, another man in the picture was never identified by the Warren Commission, whose investigation concluded Kennedy was assassinated by Oswald and that Oswald acted alone.", "In his post-convention remarks, Trump said the whole issue \u201chad nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out.\u201d No \u201cmight\u201d about it. Trump did \u201cpoint it out\u201d on national TV, and he definitively proclaimed the man in the picture to be Rafael Cruz, even though the text of the National Enquirer story doesn\u2019t go quite that far.", "Trump went on to say that neither Cruz nor anyone in his camp ever denied that it was Rafael Cruz in the photo.", "\u201cNow, Ted never denied that it was his father,\u201d Trump said in his post-convention remarks, adding later, \u201cBut they never denied. Did anybody ever deny that it was the father? They\u2019re not saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not really my father.\u2019 It\u2019s little hard to do. It looks like him.\u201d", "In fact, they have.", "\u201cThis is another garbage story in a tabloid full of garbage,\u201d Communications Director Alice Stewart told McClatchy. \u201cThe story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous, it\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d Rafael Cruz\u00a0told ABC News on May 3. \u201cI was never in New Orleans at that time.\u201d", "Ted Cruz dismissed the Enquirer story as \u201cidiotic\u201d and called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who is \u201cutterly amoral\u201d and a \u201cbully.\u201d", "\u201cDonald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in the assassinating JFK,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNow, let\u2019s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a responsible position. This is just kooky.\u201d", "As for Trump\u2019s claim that the unidentified man in the photo with Oswald \u201clooks like\u201d Rafael Cruz, experts told us not to put much stock in that kind of assessment.", "Anil Jain, a computer scientist and expert on facial recognition and biometric identification at Michigan State University, told us the images are of a poor quality, black and white, and grainy, and that \u201cIt would be very difficult, even for a photo expert, to extract facial attributes.\u201d Any conclusion about similarities is subjective, he said.", "So to sum up: despite Trump\u2019s claim to the contrary, the Cruz campaign categorically denied that it is Rafael Cruz in the photo. And Ted Cruz called the Enquirer story \u201cnuts.\u201d And there is still no evidence \u2014 at all \u2014 that the man in the photo with Oswald is Rafael Cruz.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9a194e4c-4486-4024-8e6d-d94124b8932f", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
