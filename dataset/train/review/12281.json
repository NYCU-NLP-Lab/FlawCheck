["By Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 29, 2019 | Corrected on January 30, 2019", "Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris made a few false and misleading claims in two events that kicked off her 2020 presidential campaign.", "Harris this week joined a growing number of Democrats who say they will run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. After making her announcement in California, the senator went to Des Moines, Iowa, the next day for a televised town hall meeting hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.", "Harris told the crowd\u00a0in Oakland that paychecks weren\u2019t keeping pace with the increasing cost of living. But weekly earnings, in inflation-adjusted dollars, have been going up under the Trump administration.", "Harris, Jan. 27:\u00a0Our economy today is not working for working people.\u00a0The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren\u2019t keeping up.", "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, real (meaning, inflation-adjusted) average weekly earnings for\u00a0rank-and-file\u00a0production and nonsupervisory workers\u00a0have gone up 2.5 percent since President Donald Trump took office. Those earnings rose 4.7 percent during Barack Obama\u2019s last four years as president.", "The average real weekly earnings of all private-sector workers\u00a0have increased by 2.4 percent\u00a0during Trump\u2019s tenure; they went up 3.9 percent in the previous four years.", "So, paychecks, on average, have kept up with rising inflation.", "Here\u2019s the chart on rank-and-file weekly earnings:", "In January, BLS said that real average hourly earnings for all employees went up 1.1 percent and for production and nonsupervisory employees 1.5 percent for the 12 months ending December 2018. For real average weekly earnings, the increase was 1.2 percent for both groups.", "When we asked the Harris campaign about the senator\u2019s claim, it pointed to a CBS News article from July, which said, \u201cAverage hourly earnings in June grew just 2.7 percent from the year before \u2014 slower than the rate of inflation.\u201d At the time, BLS said the average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, were \u201cunchanged\u201d for all workers, though they dropped 0.2 percent for the 12-month-period ending in June for rank-and-file workers.", "BLS\u2019 latest figures show wages outpacing inflation, however.", "The campaign also pointed to a different metric: a look at the buying power of wages in the late 1970s compared with today. In an August report, the Pew Research Center said, \u201cAfter adjusting for inflation, however, today\u2019s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power it did in 1978, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then.\u201d", "Pew also found that the wage gains have disproportionately gone to higher-wage workers.", "Pew Research Center, Aug. 7, 2018:\u00a0Meanwhile, wage gains have gone largely to the highest earners. Since 2000, usual weekly wages have risen 3% (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution and 4.3% among the lowest quarter. But among people in the top tenth of the distribution, real wages have risen a cumulative 15.7%, to $2,112 a week \u2013 nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).", "But that doesn\u2019t support the claim that wages aren\u2019t keeping pace with the cost of living.", "Harris also exaggerated the tax savings for corporations under the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in late December 2017.", "Harris, Jan. 27: And when American families are barely living paycheck to paycheck, what is this administration\u2019s response? \u2026\u00a0Their response is to give away a trillion dollars to the biggest corporations in this country.", "According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided a tax reduction over 10 years of a\u00a0net $653.8 billion for businesses. Harris\u2019 campaign confirmed to us that she was referring only to the law\u2019s reduction of the top corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent, which JCT estimates will reduce corporate taxes by $1.35 trillion over a decade.", "But other provisions in the law that raised business taxes, such as changes in allowable deductions for net operating losses and interest, caused the net benefit for corporations to be hundreds of billions lower than that.", "The individual income tax changes in the law amounted to an estimated $1.13 trillion tax reduction over 10 years, and overall, including changes to international taxes, the law would reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over that time period.", "Harris\u2019 claim echoes past statements by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who misleadingly said last year that the tax law was \u201ca $1.3 trillion tax break for corporations.\u201d As we\u2019ve said, the net benefit is about half that.", "Plus,\u00a0Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, told us when we wrote about this claim before that the $324 billion the international tax provisions would raise over 10 years would come \u201calmost all from corporations.\u201d Nearly all of that comes from\u00a0a\u00a0one-time, reduced rate\u00a0on foreign profits that U.S. corporations have kept overseas.", "In the CNN town hall on Jan. 28, Tapper asked Harris about \u201ccriticism we\u2019re hearing of you from the left\u201d \u2014 specifically during her time as the state attorney general.", "Tapper: [T]hey talk about things that you did as attorney general or as prosecutor or as a district attorney in San Francisco. Let me just ask about one of them.", "Harris: Sure.", "Tapper: Which is, when you were attorney general, you opposed legislation that would have required your office to investigate fatal shootings involving police officers. Why did you oppose that bill?", "Harris: So, I did not oppose the bill. I had a process when I was attorney general of not weighing in on bills and initiatives, because as attorney general, I had a responsibility for writing the title and summary. So I did not weigh in.", "That\u2019s misleading. Harris\u00a0may not have taken an official position on the bill, but she did oppose the concept of the bill. And her views on the topic were well known.", "The bill \u2014 AB 86, sponsored by Assemblymember Kevin McCarty \u2014 would have required the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate police shootings that involved the death of a civilian. It would have given the special prosecutor the authority to determine whether criminal charges should be filed.", "The Assembly Committee on Public Safety approved the bill in April 2015, but it went no further.", "At the time, Harris did not take an official position on McCarty\u2019s bill. But she had already made clear that \u201cshe does not support the idea of taking prosecutorial discretion away from locally elected district attorneys,\u201d\u00a0the Capitol Weekly wrote in a May 18, 2015, story.", "Capitol Weekly, May 18, 2015:\u00a0[Harris] has said the current process of investigating civilian deaths by local law enforcement is effective enough. She also has said that the local district attorneys should have the authority to investigate officer-involved shootings, in part because they are elected by \u2014 and held accountable to \u2014 local constituents.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an inherent conflict,\u201d Harris said in an interview with The Chronicle back in December. \u201cWhere there are abuses, we have designed the system to address them.\u201d", "During that interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Harris said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys.\u201d", "She told the Chronicle that the state didn\u2019t need a mechanism for a special prosecutor, because \u201cif I decided that there was a case where there was a local prosecutor who was breaking the law, who was committing prosecutorial misconduct, we would come in and take the case.\u201d", "McCarty, who supported Harris\u2019 successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2016, told the Los Angeles Times\u00a0in 2016 that he was disappointed that she didn\u2019t support his bill.", "Although Harris said her office had a policy of not taking a position on legislation, we found at least one example of her taking a position on a bill. In 2015, Harris\u00a0opposed state legislation that would have imposed statewide standards for the use of body cameras on law enforcement officials \u2014 saying she didn\u2019t want a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach,\u201d and preferred leaving such decisions up to local officials.", "When we asked about Harris\u2019 response to Tapper, her campaign told us\u00a0that the senator \u201cmisheard the question.\u201d She thought Tapper was asking about her position on a ballot initiative, and her office does not weigh in on ballot initiatives because it writes the title and summary, her campaign said. We note, however, that Harris immediately responded to Tapper\u2019s question by saying, \u201cI did not oppose the bill.\u201d [Emphasis is ours.]\u00a0It wasn\u2019t until later in her response that she referenced ballot initiatives.", "As for Harris\u2019 position on the special prosecutor bill, her campaign said:\u00a0\u201cShe didn\u2019t take a position on the special prosecutor because she personally feels as the [Capitol Weekly] article says, \u2018local district attorneys should have the authority to investigate officer-involved shootings, in part because they are elected by \u2014 and held accountable to \u2014 local constituents.'\u201d", "Correction, Jan. 30: Our original story included a typo. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided a net tax reduction over 10 years for businesses of an estimated $653.8 billion, not million, as we originally wrote.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
