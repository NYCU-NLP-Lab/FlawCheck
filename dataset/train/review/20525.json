Using the key words \u20181212 pillars Rameshwaram temple\u2019, we found that architecture containing exactly 1212 pillars pertains to the Ramanathaswamy temple, at Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu. The temple has 1212 pillars in the outer corridor, considered to be the longest temple corridor in the world. This information is available on the website of the Ramanathaswamy temple.", "The claim, insofar as it states that there is a hall of 1212 pillars at the Rameshwaram temple, is correct, Interestingly however, the outer corridor (or third corridor), which has 1212 pillars, looks nothing like the picture circulated on social media. A photograph of the corridor at the Ramanathaswamy temple is posted below.", "Since the photograph which has been shared with the claim does not represent the temple at Rameshwaram, Alt News used the reverse-image search tool to establish its origin.

This suggests that the photograph shared so widely on social media, is photoshopped. Alt News could not find the precise image from any credible source. Moreover, a closer look at the viral image reveals that the pillars on the left have been photoshopped, as the damage visible on the pillar in the foreground is replicated in the other pillars.", "The Ramanathaswamy temple at Rameshwaram, as it stands today, was built in the 12th century by the Pandya dynasty, which had its capital at Madurai in Tamil Nadu. The temple is among the finest specimens of Dravidian architecture, of which colonnades are a key feature.", "The tomb of Hoshang Shah, built in the 15th century CE in the then kingdom of Malwa, on the other hand is a classic example of Indo-Islamic architecture, drawing influence and inspiration from Islamic as well as Hindu motifs.
