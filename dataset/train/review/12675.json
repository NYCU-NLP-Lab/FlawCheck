["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 19, 2020", "A viral claim on Facebook erroneously tells users that \u201cyou will test positive\u201d for COVID-19 if \u201cyou\u2019ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years.\u201d Vaccine and infectious disease experts told us that\u2019s false, and the Food and Drug Administration says this hasn\u2019t been observed in any authorized tests.", "Social media users are spreading a baseless claim that the flu vaccine will lead to a false-positive test result for COVID-19.", "\u201cIf you had a flu shot you will get likely get a false positive on a covid19 test,\u201d a Facebook post claims. Other posts assert: \u201cIf you\u2019ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years, you will test positive for the Wuhan strain of the Covid-19 flu.\u201d", "That\u2019s false, according to experts in vaccines and infectious diseases \u2014 and the federal agency that authorizes such tests.", "First of all, the reference to the \u201cCovid-19 flu\u201d is incorrect. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and coronaviruses are distinct from influenza viruses.", "Flu shots are made using inactivated (not infectious) flu viruses or with a single gene from a flu virus in order to produce an immune response, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nasal spray flu vaccine is made with weakened flu viruses. It takes about two weeks after someone is vaccinated for the body to develop antibodies, which help protect against the flu.", "Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview that the \u201cPCR tests\u201d \u2014 or polymerase chain reaction tests \u2014 used to identify active COVID-19 infections look for \u201cgenetic fragments that are unique to this coronavirus.\u201d", "Offit said there\u2019s no cross-reaction between influenza and the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, meaning traces of influenza wouldn\u2019t result in a positive result for COVID-19.", "Likewise, Offit said, antibody tests \u2014 or serological tests, which look for antibodies in the blood to determine past infections \u2014 \u201cuse proteins from this SARS-CoV-2, which do not cross-react with proteins from influenza.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re structurally unique,\u201d he said.", "A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration further told us that all FDA-authorized tests for COVID-19 are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus or influenza antibodies and that, to date, there has been no such cross-reactivity observed for any of the tests. That check on tests diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is important given overlapping symptoms between the two illnesses, the spokesperson added.", "Offit emphasized that flu vaccines do not contain coronaviruses, as we\u2019ve previously explained. That misconception about flu vaccines may contribute to the erroneous notion that the flu shot leads to false positive COVID-19 results. (There\u2019s also no evidence that the flu shot increases risk of COVID-19, as the CDC notes and as we\u2019ve previously reported.)", "Most flu vaccines are manufactured using chicken eggs, but about 10% in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines \u2014 which use Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells. Offit said those cells are \u201cfree from any virus.\u201d", "Many of the posts advancing the false claim attribute it to Rashid Buttar, an osteopathic doctor who has spread conspiracy theories online. Buttar has been previously reprimanded (including last year) by the North Carolina Medical Board. In 2010, he accepted a reprimand and agreed to provide patients with a consent form disclosing that the \u201ctreatment and therapies that are to be provided by Dr. Buttar have not been proven effective by traditional research studies or conventional clinical trials.\u201d", "Buttar made remarks about the false positives, similar to the Facebook claims, in a video that has appeared across social media platforms since April.", "\u201cAll the way back to 1984, all the way up to now, 2018, there are multiple studies that show that if you\u2019ve had the flu shot \u2014 especially the trivalent flu shot \u2014 false positives on COVID-19 testing,\u201d Buttar claims. Later, he adds: \u201cThe studies clearly show that if you\u2019ve had a flu shot, you\u2019re going to test positive for COVID-19.\u201d", "But the novel coronavirus wasn\u2019t discovered until late 2019, so there couldn\u2019t have been studies between 1984 and 2018 that looked at false positive test results for the virus that causes COVID-19.", "The fact-checking website Health Feedback previously debunked the same claim when it was being circulated with references to a 2012 study in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The study compared the incidence of non-influenza respiratory viruses in children who had received the trivalent flu vaccine \u2014 which protects against three different flu viruses \u2014 with those who hadn\u2019t received the vaccine.", "The study looked at four types of coronavirus that cause the common cold \u2014 not SARS-CoV-2. And, of 69 trivalent flu vaccine recipients, only one tested positive for a coronavirus \u2014 which Health Feedback notes is \u201cinsufficient to draw any causal association between the flu shot and coronavirus detection.\u201d", "Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email that \u201c[f]lu vaccines will not cause false positive tests in people infected with SARS-CoV2. The influenza virus is very different from coronaviruses.\u201d", "\u201cIf the influenza vaccine produced antibodies against SARS-CoV2, we would not be seeing so many severe cases of Covid19,\u201d he said. \u201cAre these people claiming that the flu vaccine also protects against Covid19?\u201d (It doesn\u2019t.)", "And Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Columbia University Medical Center, said he also was aware of no evidence to support the claim that flu shots would cause false positive results for COVID-19.", "\u201cThe fact that there were individuals who tested negative for the coronavirus suggests that this can\u2019t be true, as a number of them must have had flu shots, certainly within the past ten years,\u201d he said in an email.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
