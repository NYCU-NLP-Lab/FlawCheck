Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM.", "In the Feb. 25, 2015 interview, which we caught online, Patrick said: \"We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We\u2019ll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That\u2019s more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined.\"", "This fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined?", "We emailed Patrick\u2019s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction\u2014rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state\u2019s expected fiscal-year-end reserves.", "The Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year state revenue forecast in January 2015. Hegar said the state\u2019s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017.", "Per Patrick\u2019s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined.", "Texas, Alaska outpace other states", "An online search led us to a fall 2014 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined \"Year-End Balances\" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, \"a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015.\"", "Pew official", "For more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a report on how states might build rainy day funds.

An adjoining chart indicates Texas ending fiscal 2015 with $8 billion in its rainy day fund alone compared to other states together winding up with about $34 billion in such funds.", "Texas appears to have bigger balances than many states.
