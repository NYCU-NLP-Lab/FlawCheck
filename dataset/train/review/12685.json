The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people,\" the writer, German Lopez, explained.", "\"Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms,\" Lopez wrote.", "The Switzerland-based group actually offered a less specific estimate. On page 46 of the survey itself, the group estimated that the United States is home to \"roughly 35-50 percent\" of the world\u2019s civilian-owned guns.", "Lopez, for his part, told PolitiFact that he split the difference in the range.", "\"It's pretty typical in research to just take the average of a range,\" he said. \"So the range here is 35-50. If you take the average of this, it lands at about 42. That's with a margin of error of about 7.5, obviously, but it's just a shorthand for what the research finds.\"", "The Small Arms Study from 2007 remains the most comprehensive research private gun ownership worldwide, said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of the widely-cited study \"Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries,\" published in 2016.", "The Small Arms Study is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva that\u2019s supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as donations from other governments.
