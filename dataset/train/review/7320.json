Oregon has no U.S. senator named Meekal Night (the state's sitting senators are Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley), and Senate Bill 816 (S. 816) of the current Congress deals with \"amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow rollovers from 529 programs to ABLE accounts,\" not the elimination of discounts for seniors and veterans.", "(Likewise, the Oregon state senate has no such senator or bill, either.)", "This meme is a simply a fabrication created by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a site that is part of a network of fake news sites dedicated to spreading political misinformation and disinformation under the guise of proffering \u201csatire.\u201d", "The Fake News Codex. \u00a0  \u201cChristopher Blair Network.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0  7 May 2018.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
