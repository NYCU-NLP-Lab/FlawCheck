["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In Oregon, fresh cut Christmas trees are as cherished as hazelnuts and Hood strawberries: We grow a lot of them, so we own them. So it was with some astonishment that PolitiFact Oregon heard that President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy holiday trees.\n\n\"Is President Obama 'the Grinch who taxed Christmas' trees?\" queried a headline on the Los Angeles Times website. A Republican congressman from Louisiana issued a press release, slamming the Democratic president for trying to \"sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees.\" By the end of Nov. 9, 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation had logged more than 2,000 comments on its blog post, \"Obama Couldn\u2019t Wait: His New Christmas Tree Tax.\"\n\nLocally, we spotted a Multnomah County GOP retweet of the Republican National Committee: \"Obama admin creates new tax on Christmas tree farms, fees get passed onto the consumer.\"\n\nWhat in the name of Rudolph and Frosty and the Polar Express was going on?\n\nOregon is the No. 1 grower of Christmas firs and pine, harvesting more than 7 million trees. (That\u2019s twice the haul of No. 2 North Carolina.) \u00a0Was the president seriously imposing a new \"tax\" that might make our holidays a little less ho-ho-ho?\n\nAs it happens, a national fresh tree group had sought the 15-cent tree assessment to better promote its products. It\u2019s a \"checkoff program\"much like the ones already in place for beef (\"it\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner\")and pork (\"the other white meat\").\n\nThe Agriculture Department approved the idea. The Internet exploded. By the end of the day, the White House had decided to re-assess. \u00a0\n\nBetty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who heads up the Christmas Tree Promotion Now campaign, said she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by the president. \u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s absurd. We\u2019ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years. The industry has talked about this for 20 years,\" Malone said. \"This started long before Obama\" was in the White House.\n\nTo be fair, not everyone in the industry embraces the idea, although the National Christmas Tree Association reports the majority of responses to the proposed program were positive.\n\nWould the fee be passed on to consumers? That\u2019s unclear, said Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association. \"It doesn\u2019t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFinally, there\u2019s the question of whether the 15-cent assessment is actually a \"tax.\" The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn\u2019t go to government. Rick Dungey, spokesman for the national tree association, insists it is not a tax. (He also says consumers should not see a difference in tree prices.)\n\nIn Oregon, at least, revenue has to go into the general treasury in order to be considered a tax. If the government doesn\u2019t touch the money, even though government mandates it, the assessment is neither a tax nor a fee.\n\nBut we digress. We\u2019re talking about the federal government. Let\u2019s turn to federal sources, with the help of national PolitiFact.\n\n\"It certainly doesn't smell or quack like a tax,\" said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and a former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton.\n\nOn the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the Cato Institute, says \"a coercive levy is a tax.\"", "We also checked with Stephen Bell, communications director for U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the Louisiana congressman who vowed to block Obama\u2019s sneaky tree tax, and Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman. It didn\u2019t matter to either of them that industry had sought the assessment or that industry was denying it\u2019s a tax.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter who asked for it,\" said Bell. \"It\u2019s at the sole discretion of the Obama administration to impose a tax, and they decided to impose this 15-cent tree tax.\"\n\nThis is a tax, added Spicer, because \"it\u2019s not voluntary. It\u2019s not a contribution to a cause.\"\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Sources appear split on whether this truly is a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. As for the claim that Obama created this new tax, that suggests that he came up with the program -- when it\u2019s clear the idea preceded his presidency and originated with the industry.\n\nThose are pretty big facts to ignore. So we rate the claim Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.", "Interview with Betty Malone, Nov. 9, 2011", "Interview with Stephen Bell, spokesman, U.S. Rep.
