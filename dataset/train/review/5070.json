["About this rating", "On 1 May 2015, a rumor began to circulate online claiming a \u201cstudy\u201d assessed the beards of average men and made a shocking discovery: they\u2019re basically dripping with fecal matter (known colloquially as \u201cpoop\u201d).", "The headlines followed, ones such as \u201cStudy: Men\u2019s Beards are Filled with Poop and Nasty Bacteria,\u201d \u201cYour beard is dirty as a toilet,\u201d and \u201cHow Filthy Is Your Beard?\u201d The intrigue of the claim at a time when beards were certainly somewhat in fashion led to little scrutiny of its base facts... most notably, what study?", "For example, here is one of the earliest iterations of this claim, which came from a site devoted to casting calls (not a medical journal or other scientifically credible site) and was loaded with scary phrases about fecal contamination:", "However, a new study has shown that beards are basically filled with more bacteria than the inside of a toilet. According to KOAT Albuquerque, several anonymous men allowed a microbiologist to swab their beards for bacterial testing. A few of the beards contained standard stuff while others revealed fecal matter. While the microbiologist recommended a good beard scrubbing and regular hand-washing to diminish the amount of germs, he didn\u2019t explain how a man\u2019s beard could end up with poop in the first place.", "But that underlying \u201cstudy\u201d was actually merely a brief local news report by Albuquerque station KOAT that consisted of a newsperson and a Quest Diagnostics lab in Albuquerque taking swabs from the beards of a small handful of volunteers, analyzing them for microbes, finding a few seemingly yucky results, and discussing the outcome with a single microbiologist \u2014 from whom a few very short, sensational-sounding, out-of-context sound bites were excerpted.", "This tenuous \u201cstudy\u201d was soon the subject of a multiplicity of sensationalized headlines comparing men\u2019s beards to everything fecal:", "o Cosmopolitan: \u201cNew study finds beards are toilet-level dirty\u201d", "o New York Post: \u201cBearded men have poop on their faces\u201d", "o Canada Journal: \u201cYour filthy beard contains more s\u2014 than a toilet, study shows\u201d", "o Daily Mirror: \u201cSome beards contain more poo than a toilet shocking study reveals\u201d", "o News.com.au: \u201cShock new research reveals some beards contain more poo than a toilet\u201d", "o WSB-TV: \u201cBeards are filled with bacteria and \u2018as dirty as toilets\u2019\u201d", "However, as the Guardian observed, KOAT\u2019s process fell far short of what constitutes a rigorous study and didn\u2019t actually detect the presence of fecal material in men\u2019s beards:", "As far as I can tell there was no proper study, no team of microbiologists and no poo in beards. The origin of the story appears to be this segment from a TV news network in New Mexico, which involved a reporter swabbing a \u201chandful\u201d of men\u2019s beards and then sending the swabs to a microbiologist in a lab to culture any microbes present.", "The reporter then interviewed the microbiologist, John Golobic, who identified a few of the bacteria present as \u201centerics\u201d, that is they are bacteria that normally live in the intestines.", "\u201cThose are the types of things you\u2019d find in faeces,\u201d he said.", "And that\u2019s all. Somehow, from this story other media organisations have managed to get poo in beards.", "While it is true that human faeces are partially composed of gut bacteria, it\u2019s not accurate to describe those bacteria on their own as faeces.", "Similarly, the Washington Post noted that \u201cgut bacteria\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing as \u201cpoop,\u201d not is its presence either alarming or harmful:", "The problem with this is that bacteria known to associate poop is not necessarily literal poop. In fact it\u2019s probably not. And saying that something is gross for being covered in bacteria is pretty ridiculous, because anything that exists in our physical realm is definitely going to be covered in bacteria.", "I have bad news for y\u2019all: You\u2019re covered in poo bacteria. COVERED. Look to your left, look to your right. There\u2019s probably poo bacteria on both sides and also in front of you. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really fine. Embrace the poo bacteria, it is a part of you because you are a multitude of microorganisms, each more special than the last.", "But unless you\u2019ve put it there intentionally, you almost certainly don\u2019t have poop on your face. No matter how thick your beard is.", "The Guardian concurred in that assessment:", "Even if this was a properly conducted scientific study with a large number of samples and published in a reputable journal, there wouldn\u2019t necessarily be any cause for concern.", "Human skin is home to great diversity of microbes, and it\u2019s not unheard of for types of bacteria normally found in the gut, such as E. coli, to be also found on the skin.", "It may be true that some beards may be less than rigorously hygienic, but proclaiming them to be \u201cfilthy\u201d and \u201cdirty as a toilet\u201d based on a scant TV news survey is an alarmist exaggeration.", "Da, Royale. \u00a0 \"Some Beards as Dirty as Toilets.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 KOAT-TV. \u00a0 30 April 2015.", "Evershed, Nick. \u00a0 \"No Need for Men to Get Flush-Faced About Faeces in Beards.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 4 May 2015.", "Feltman, Rachel. \u00a0 \"No, Your Beard Isn\u2019t Full of Poop (Probably).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 4 May 2015.", "Project Casting. \u00a0 \"Study: Men's Beards Are Filled with Poop and Nasty Bacteria.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 3 May 2015.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
