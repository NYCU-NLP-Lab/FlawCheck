Very dishonest media!\" the Republican presidential candidate tweeted Oct. 30.", "Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!", "FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 that said the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into the private email server that Clinton used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information.", "There\u2019s no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook buried this story in the first couple days after it broke.", "We reached out to the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no response.", "Sure, the FBI story come out on a Friday, so it competed on social media with users\u2019 upcoming Halloween plans, the World Series and other events. But the topic was certainly popular.", "Twitter", "Twitter doesn\u2019t have an algorithm to highlight or suppress stories, said Jen Golbeck, a University of Maryland professor and social networks expert. In their feeds, users see everything posted by the people they follow.", "If Trump was referring to Twitter\u2019s \"moments\" feature, the FBI story appears on an accessible archived screenshot of the \"moments\" homepage the evening before he tweeted his claim.", "The website Mashable took a screenshot of Twitter\u2019s featured tweets, which Twitter displays when a logged-out user visits Twitter.com, around the time Trump tweeted.

It does have the ability to suppress or highlight stories by altering its algorithm, though no one has produced evidence that this is something Facebook did with the FBI story.", "Further, Facebook tailors its trending topics based on the particular user\u2019s interests. So the FBI story may not have appeared in one person\u2019s trending topics bar, while appearing in another\u2019s.", "While these companies probably don\u2019t suppress certain stories, it\u2019s hard to disprove a claim like Trump\u2019s beyond a shadow of a doubt because there are so many ways social media sites could manipulate content visibility, said Kjerstin Thorson, a communications professor at Michigan State University.", "\"Did it appear on people\u2019s trending box space on Facebook? How long was it there? Was it trending only for some people and not for others? Was the story made visible in people\u2019s Facebook news feeds or Twitter streams or in Google search results, via each platform\u2019s display algorithm?\" Thorson said. \u00a0\"Outside of internal company data, there is no source I know of who could check that.\"", "Our ruling", "Trump said, \"Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.
