["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "When it comes to the massive Medicare Part D prescription drug program, you\u2019d think Uncle Sam would have pretty good leverage in negotiating drug prices.\n\nBut the government is actually barred from doing such bargaining, according to Democratic Wisconsin Congresswoman Rep. Tammy Baldwin -- who lays blame on her opponent for the U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson.\n\nBaldwin attacked Thompson, who served as health and human services secretary under GOP President George W. Bush, in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview.\n\nShe told John \"Sly\" Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WTDY-AM and -FM in Madison:\n\n\"We have written into law, under Tommy Thompson's watch, a prohibition for the federal government to be involved in negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for better prices for seniors for drugs. That's unbelievable. You know, if you buy in bulk, you get a better deal.\"\n\nLet's check both parts of Baldwin\u2019s claim -- that the government is prohibited from negotiating on drug prices and that Thompson played a role in creating the ban.\n\nNegotiating drug prices\n\nMedicare Part D is a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Congress created it by passing legislation in 2003, although the program didn\u2019t take effect until 2006.\n\nHere is some background from PolitiFact National:\n\nIn rating as Half True a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum -- that Medicare Part D came in 40 percent under budget because of its design -- our colleagues explained that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them.\n\nPolitiFact National has also reportedon the program as part of its Obameter, which tracks promises President Barack Obama made as a candidate in 2008.\n\nSince Congress approved the program, proposed by Bush, Democrats have groused that it was a huge giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare negotiate lower prices. But he backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his health care reform bill, and no provision on negotiating drug prices was included in the bill that became law in 2010.\n\n(That eventually led our colleagues to rate Obama\u2019s pledge as a Promise Broken.)\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t any negotiating.\n\nA July 2006 New York Times article cited by Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus reported that \"Congress -- in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry \u2014 barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers.\"\n\nThompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir also cited the negotiating done by the various companies offering Medicare Part D plans, arguing it has resulted in the overall cost of Medicare Part D to be lower than projected.\n\n(PolitiFact National found in June 2011, in rating Santorum\u2019s claim, that the program came in under budget because fewer people than expected used it, drug spending increased less than expected and the program had encouraged use of generic drugs.)\n\nBut we\u2019re not here to settle Nemoir\u2019s claim; and one could argue, as Baldwin does, that costs could be even lower if the federal government did the negotiating.\n\nWhen we checked back with Nemoir, he acknowledged that the federal government is prohibited from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D plans.\n\nThompson\u2019s role\n\nThe second part of Baldwin\u2019s claim is that the prohibition was put into law \"under Thompson\u2019s watch\" -- indicating he didn\u2019t unilaterally impose the ban, but played a role.\n\nKraus cited a number of news articles, including one in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said Thompson was the Bush administration\u2019s \"point man\" on getting Medicare Part D through Congress; and one in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said Thompson \"lobbied tirelessly\" for the plan.\n\nMoreover, Nemoir acknowledged that the prohibition on the federal government was done under Thompson.\n\nOur rating\n\nBaldwin said federal law adopted \"under Tommy Thompson's watch\" prohibits the federal government from negotiating for \"better prices\" on prescription drugs for senior citizens.\n\nHer reference was to the Medicare Part D prescription program, which Thompson lobbied for and which includes the prohibition she stated.\n\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s statement True.", "WTDY AM-FM, John Sylvester interview (at 10:00) of Tammy Baldwin, Aug. 15, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Tammy Baldwin campaign communications director John Kraus, Aug. 22, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Tommy Thompson campaign political director Brian Nemoir, Aug. 23 and 31, 2012\n\nPolitiFact National, \"Action unlikely before end of administration,\" April 25, 2012\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, \"Resources on the Medicare prescription drug benefit\"\n\nAARP, \"How Medicare Part D works,\" January 2011\n\nNew York Times, \"A windfall from shifts to Medicare,\" July 18, 2006\n\nNew York Times, \"Despite Democrats\u2019 warnings, private Medicare plans find success,\" Aug. 25, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Some Wisconsin lawmakers undecided on federal Medicare bill, drug plan,\" Nov. 21, 2003\n\nPhiladelphia Inquirer, \"Thompson leaving, but Rumsfeld to stay,\" Dec. 4, 2004\n\nPolitiFact National, \"Did Medicare Part D come in 40 percent under budget because of its design?,\" June 15, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
