It has impact on estate planning, it has impact on future generations,\" Jensen told host Laura Ingraham. \"The idea that we\u2019re going to allow people to massage and game the numbers is a real issue because we're going to undermine the [public's] trust.\"", "On April 3, 2020, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics issued guidance to physicians, coroners, and medical examiners who fill out death certificates to list COVID-19 as an underlying cause of death in the absence of a test \"if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.\"", "The guidelines specify:", "In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID\u201319 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID\u201319 on a death certificate as 'probable' or 'presumed.' In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID\u201319 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID\u201319 should be conducted whenever possible.", "Jensen's commentary contributed to a narrative promoted by right-leaning media outlets that the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic is not as deadly or serious as reported, and that social-distancing measures implemented to control its spread are unwarranted. \"HUGE! MN Senator and Dr. Reveals HHS Document Coaching Him on How to Overcount COVID-19 Cases,\" read one headline from the conspiracy site The Gateway Pundit.", "Experts, however, agree that COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are being undercounted, not overcounted, due to the lack of available diagnostic tests.", "\"I don\u2019t think in any case are we over-estimating the deaths due to COVID-19. I think most likely we\u2019re underestimating and in some cases we may be underestimating by a lot,\" Bob Anderson, who heads the mortality statistics branch at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, told us by phone. Anderson noted that medical examiners' offices in the hard-hit state of New York are overwhelmed, and that the state has had an increase in unattended deaths in which COVID-19 was a likely factor, but no tests were available to confirm.", "\"We\u2019re not asking [health care providers] to write [COVID-19] down for everyone who was possibly exposed. We're asking only if the patient showed symptoms, and they're reasonably certain\" the patient had the disease, Anderson told us. \"When the evidence tells you that COVID-19 was the likely cause of death then you should report it as the likely cause of death, whether you have a lab test or not. And medical examiners, physicians, and coroners are trained to make these determinations.\"", "As of this writing, the U.S. had more than 700,000 COVID-19 cases, with the death count nearing 40,000. Our attempts to reach Scott Jensen for comment were unsuccessful.", "CDC.gov.\u00a0\"Guidance for Certifying Deaths Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201319).\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a03 April 2020.", "Kliff, Sarah and Julie Bosman.\u00a0\"Official Counts Understate the U.S. Coronavirus Death Toll.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times.\u00a05 April 2020.", "Brown, Emma, et al.\u00a0\"Which Deaths Count Toward the COVID-19 Death Toll?
