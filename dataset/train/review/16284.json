["By Catherine Monk", "Posted on November 15, 2018", "Q: Did Kurt Cobain predict a Donald Trump presidency more than 20 years ago?", "A: No. There is no evidence he did, and Cobain\u2019s former manager labeled the quote a fake.", "There is no evidence the late Kurt Cobain said Donald Trump might become president.", "That claim is made in a viral meme that displays a black-and-white photo of the former Nirvana frontman along with this made-up quote: \u201cIn the end I believe my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties are playing both sides from the middle and we\u2019ll elect a true outsider when we fully mature. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not a business tycoon who can\u2019t be bought and who does what\u2019s right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds.\u201d", "The meme, a version of which was reportedly first shared on a pro-Trump Facebook page in 2016, claims that Cobain made this prediction in 1993 \u2014 a year before the singer\u2019s death.", "Danny Goldberg, one of Nirvana\u2019s former managers, emphatically rejected this possibility when the meme went viral again this year. In an opinion piece for The Nation in August, Goldberg wrote, \u201cI know that the quote is not only made up but is also a grotesque perversion of Kurt\u2019s beliefs.\u201d", "We can\u2019t say what Cobain would think of the current political landscape, but we know he wasn\u2019t shy about sharing his political beliefs with reporters during his career.", "In a 1993 interview with The Advocate, Cobain discussed his decision to vote for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election (though he preferred one of Clinton\u2019s primary rivals, Jerry Brown). In the article, Cobain said he would perform at the White House, if asked. He also recalled his disappointment with Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential victory in 1980.", "At other times, the late singer similarly expressed his displeasure with the Republican Party.", "In a 1992 interview with Argentinian journalist Sergio Marchi, Cobain was very critical of the GOP, saying: \u201c\u2026 the Democrats are not close either morally or philosophically to what I think. The Democrats are very conservative, but at least they\u2019re not as conservative as the Republicans. Republicans are the incarnation of Satan. I hate them. For me the word Republican is a bad word; when someone says Republican they are saying \u2018cheat.\u2019 It\u2019s the most offensive term you can say to someone.\u201d", "In that interview, Cobain did mention his preference to see someone \u201cwho is not a professional politician\u201d become president, but when asked for his opinion of business tycoon Ross Perot, then a third-party candidate, Cobain responded, \u201cNah, the guy sucks. He\u2019s rich; I don\u2019t trust him as president.\u201d", "Although, Cobain suggested he would prefer Perot over Clinton and then-President George H. W. Bush, but didn\u2019t \u201cwant to waste\u201d his vote.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Allman, Kevin. \u201cThe Dark Side of Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain.\u201d The Advocate. 9 Feb 1993.", "Goldberg, Danny. \u201cThe Kurt Cobain Donald Trump Hoax.\u201d The Nation. 7 Aug 2018.", "Marchi, Sergio. \u201cI Used To Practice When I First Grabbed The Guitar.\u201d Cobain on Cobain: Interviews and Encounters, edited by Nick Soulsby, Chicago Review Press, 2016.", "Strauss, Neil. \u201cKurt Cobain\u2019s Downward Spiral: The Last Days of Nirvana\u2019s Leader.\u201d Rolling Stone. 2 Jun 1994.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
