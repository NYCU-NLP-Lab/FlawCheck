(Screenshot)", "Beto O\u2019Rourke may have lost his U.S. Senate race in 2018, but he still sees something to crow about. O\u2019Rourke told CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert that he helped boost turnout among young voters and that he did unusually well for a Democratic candidate in the GOP-leaning Lone Star State, where Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide race since 1994.", "\"Young voter turnout in early voting was up 500%. We won more votes than any Democrat has in the history of the state of Texas,\" O\u2019Rourke said on the show June 13.", "His campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but when we took a closer look at the data, we found that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s boast was on target.", "The part of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement about surging young-voter turnout tracks back to research by TargetSmart, a political data firm.", "On Oct. 30, the firm released a study of the data on early voting across the country. The firm used official state election figures, then harnessed a mixture of public and proprietary data to analyze this early turnout data through several demographic categories, including age.", "This prompted a number of news articles that noted the 500% increase in early voting by young people in Texas. But because the study was released one week before Election Day, we wondered whether that differential continued through the final data.", "TargetSmart\u2019s website includes final figures for 2018. It lists 118,383 Texans between the ages of 18 and 29 casting early ballots in the 2014 general election, compared to 674,027 casting early ballots in 2018.", "The 2018 figure for early voting was about 5.7 times higher than the figure for 2014, and that\u2019s close to the sixfold increase that would equate to a 500% bump.", "The increase was a smaller \u2060\u2014 though still substantial \u2060\u2014 200% once votes on Election Day are included in the tally. But in the interview with Colbert, O\u2019Rourke was clear about the metric he was using.", "Other data from 2018, from Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, found that the rate of overall youth turnout in Texas \u2060\u2014 not just early voting \u2060\u2014 roughly tripled over 2014. That\u2019s even higher than the increase found by TargetSmart.", "The Tufts study found that O\u2019Rourke saw his biggest levels of support in counties with high proportions of young voters, especially Latino youth.", "A footnote: O\u2019Rourke hired TargetSmart to work on data projects, but the data cited here was from a publicly released, 50-state project the firm undertook, not something that O\u2019Rourke paid for or had influence on.", "The part of his assertion about winning more votes than any Texas Democrat is also correct, though O\u2019Rourke benefited from the state\u2019s fast-growing population.", "We looked through vote totals for Democratic nominees who ran statewide in recent elections \u2014 presidential, senatorial, gubernatorial, attorney general, and other statewide offices.", "Here\u2019s the summary of what we found, along with the totals for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, a Texan who won a landslide presidential victory that year.", "In general, as the table shows, Democrats ran especially strong in Texas in 2018. It was a good year for the party nationally, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy ended up being unusually popular among Texas voters.", "Even though presidential-year turnout is usually higher than midterm-election turnout, no fewer than seven Texas Democrats won more votes in 2018 than Barack Obama did in either of his presidential runs in the state. The 2018 nominees who accomplished this were those for attorney general, lieutenant governor, agriculture commissioner, railroad commissioner, comptroller, land commissioner, and governor.", "The only pre-2018 candidate to come close to the top of this list was Hillary Clinton, the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee in 2016.", "Of course, all of these 2018 candidates, including O\u2019Rourke, were blessed with running after Texas\u2019 population had expanded dramatically.", "Texas has \"seen its number of registered voters increase more than fivefold over the past 55 years, from 3 million in 1964 to 7.7 million in 1990 and 15.8 million in 2019,\" said Mark P. Jones, a Rice University political scientist.", "Still, O\u2019Rourke beat them all, becoming the first Texas Democrat to win 4 million votes or more in a statewide election.", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s share of the vote \u2014 48.3% \u2014 is well below what Democrats tended to receive when Texas was a Democratic-dominated state, or at least more competitive than it is today.", "Still, during the current, two-decade-plus era in which Republicans have dominated Texas, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s showing represented a breakthrough for Democrats, despite his loss. He won a larger percentage of the vote than any statewide Democrat since 1998, when Paul Hobby won 49.0% in the race for state comptroller. (Hobby lost, too.)", "O\u2019Rourke said that in 2018 when he ran for senator, \"young voter turnout in early voting was up 500%. We won more votes than any Democrat has in the history of the state of Texas.\"", "His assertion about young voter turnout is backed up by an analysis of state election data by the firm TargetSmart. And he\u2019s correct that no Democrat has ever won more raw votes in a Texas statewide election than he has, an accomplishment achieved through a combination of his own electoral success, a pro-Democratic environment in 2018, and Texas\u2019 rapid population growth in recent years.", "We rate his statement True.", "Beto O\u2019Rourke, remarks on CBS\u2019 The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, June 13, 2019", "Tom Bonier, \"Early Vote Data Shows Young and Non-White Voter Turnout Surge,\" Oct. 30, 2018", "TargetSmart, TargetEarly database, accessed June 19, 2019", "Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (Tufts University), \"County by County, Young People of Color Key to Democratic Candidates in Close Races,\" Nov. 12, 2018", "SElectionAtlas.org", "Ballotpedia", "The Independent, \"Midterms 2018: Early voting by young people up 500% in Texas and Georgia,\" Oct. 31, 2018", "Politico, \"Here\u2019s What Beto Could Unleash on Trump,\" Feb. 22, 2019", "Washington Post, \"Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s voter-enthusiasm sales pitch isn\u2019t as strong as he thinks,\" March 25, 2019", "Email interview with Jennifer McAndrew, spokeswoman for the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, June 20, 2019", "Email interview with Michael Czin, spokesman for TargetSmart, June 19, 2019", "Email interview with Mark P.
