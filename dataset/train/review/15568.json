Since this one is new to many readers, we'll revisit some of our previous findings and address the new charge about slouching. (This is the first time we can recall slouching being used as the basis for a political attack.)", "The Obama photo was taken Sept. 16, 2007, in Indianola, Iowa, at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual political event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin. The caption on the\n\nTime\n\nphoto says Obama and the others \"stand during the national anthem.\"", "Obama was on stage with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Harkin's wife Ruth.", "As the\n\nTime\n\ncaption indicates, the photo was taken during the national anthem, not the pledge, so the photo does not support the allegation that Obama \"turns his back and . . . slouches\" during the pledge. This is corroborated by\n\nan ABC News video\n\nof the occasion.", "It's clear from the video that the assembled Democrats are not turning their backs on the flag to make an antipatriotic statement. They are looking at the same point \u2014 presumably the woman singing the anthem.", "It is a matter of interpretation whether Obama is slouching as the anthem is played. The photo shows him with his hands clasped in front of his waist while the others have their hands over the heart (a point of anthem protocol that we addressed in\n\nthis item).\n\nBut it doesn't look to us like he's slouching and there's no evidence to suggest his posture was making an antipatriotic statement.", "Obama has responded to these allegations by saying he often leads the pledge when he presides over the Senate, as seen in\n\nthis video from the Senate.", "So once again, we find a chain e-mail is incorrect about Obama.
