["About this rating", "After California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward in September 2018 to accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, conspiracy theorists spun yarns aimed at implicating her in a supposed plot by Democratic Party elites to smear Kavanaugh's reputation.", "Conspiracy mongers circulated miscaptioned photographs allegedly linking Dr. Ford to prominent liberals. They also asserted, falsely, that Ford had filed similar sexual misconduct accusations against a previous Trump appointee, Neil Gorsuch. They shared images that supposedly showed Ford attending an anti-Trump rally and exhibiting drunken behavior at parties.", "During the week of her scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, they made a concerted effort to demonstrate so-called \"close family ties\" between Ford and former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was fired in mid-2018 for sending anti-Trump text messages. Far-right bloggers have portrayed Strzok as a \"deep state\" operative \"planted\" in the FBI to undermine Trump's presidency.", "One version of the family-ties scenario held that Strzok's sister-in-law (identified in the video below as \"Jill Strzok\") works with, or used to work with, Christine Blasey Ford's brother, Thomas Blasey:\n\nShould we even be surprised anymore?

We can't tell, based on the information at hand, what familial connection (if any) the grandfathers may have had, nor how far back one has to trace these separate branches of the Strzok family tree to find a point of intersection. At best, Peter and Sidney Strzok could be distant cousins, which would make Jill Strzok Peter's distant cousin by marriage.\nAnother area of the chart indicates, correctly, that Christine Blasey Ford has a brother named Thomas Blasey, whom the Washington Post confirmed is a Washington-area lawyer. According to his LinkedIn profile, Blasey currently holds the position of assistant general counsel at Northrop Grumman Corporation in Falls Church, Virginia.\nIt's alleged that Thomas Blasey and Jill Strzok currently or formerly worked for the same company, Exelis Inc., an aerospace and defense contractor. Blasey's LinkedIn profile confirms he was employed by Exelis Inc. from 2011 to 2015. Although Jill Strzok's LinkedIn profile doesn't list Exelis by name, it does list ITT Corporation as one of her ongoing employers from 2005 to the present. Exelis Inc. was a division of ITT until it was spun off as a separate company (still branded \"ITT Exelis) in 2011. We found evidence that Strzok was an employee of Exelis Inc. in the form of an undated document naming ITT Exelis as the prime contractor for a military software design project and Jill Strzok as the \"procuring contract officer\" on behalf of Exelis.\nWe have not been able to determine the exact period of time during which Strzok worked specifically for Exelis, however. A popular \"people search\" website, Radaris.com, says she worked there between 2005 and 2007, though that information is unvetted and possibly unreliable.\nIn any case, it scarcely matters whether Strzok and Blasey worked for the company at the same time. Strzok is a subcontracts manager who worked out of Exelis's Colorado offices; Blasey is an intellectual property lawyer who worked out of the company's office in McLean, Virginia. It's unlikely their paths ever crossed.\nMore to the point, the notion that Jill Strzok and Thomas Blasey (who conceivably have never met one another) represent \"three degrees of separation\" between alleged \"deep state\" conspirator Peter Strzok and Christine Blasey Ford depends on Jill and Peter Strzok being close relatives, which they demonstrably are not.", "One version of the family-ties scenario held that Strzok's sister-in-law (identified in the video below as \"Jill Strzok\") works with, or used to work with, Christine Blasey Ford's brother, Thomas Blasey:", "Should we even be surprised anymore?
