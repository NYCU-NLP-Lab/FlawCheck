["On May 28, the Supreme Court heard the Suo Moto case regarding the plight of migrant labourers stranded in different parts of the country due to the lockdown. During the hearing, Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta presented the steps that the government had taken so far to tackle the issue. He argued that the Centre is doing a lot but there are \u201cProphets of Doom\u201d who spread negativity. He also said that these \u201carmchair intellectuals\u201d do not recognize the nation\u2019s effort.", "Solicitor General Tushar Mehta:", "\u201cCentre is doing a lot to prevent #COVID19 but there are Prophets of Doom in our country who only spread negativity, negativity, negativity.

There was a panic-stricken child. A vulture was waiting for the child to die. He photographed it and the photo was published in NYT and the photographer was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. He committed suicide after 4 months. A journalist had asked him \u2013 what happened to the child? He said I don\u2019t know, I had to return home. Then the reporter asked him \u2013 how many vultures were there? He said one. The reporter said \u2013 no. There were two.

In an attempt to silence any criticism of the government, the message draws parallels with Kevin Carter\u2019s story and compares those highlighting the misery of the migrant workers to vultures. Tushar Mehta got the year of the famine wrong but narrated the rest of the story almost verbatim.", "It is shocking that Solicitor General of India quoted word to word from a viral WhatsApp message in the top court of the country.", "Other versions of the story of the starving child and the vulture with a different messaging have been viral internationally since years. A different message accompanying the story was fact-checked by Snopes in 2008.", "The photograph of the starving child and the vulture is regarded as one of the most iconic images that came out of the 1993 famine in Sudan. Kevin Carter, the South African photojournalist, had committed suicide a few months after being awarded the Pulitzer prize for the image.", "The photograph first appeared in the New York Times on March 26, 1993. When flooded with queries about the fate of the child, in an editor\u2019s note on March 30, 1993, New York Times clarified, \u201cMany readers have asked about the fate of the girl. The photographer reports that she recovered enough to resume her trek after the vulture was chased away. It is not known whether she reached the center.\u201d", "Carter faced a lot of criticism from those who believed he did not help the child and shot a photograph instead. A profile on his life and death in TIME magazine said that the Pulitzer attracted \u201cthe critical focus that comes with fame.\u201d Some journalists in South Africa called his prize a \u201cfluke,\u201d alleging that he had somehow set up the tableau, said the article which has no mention of a conversation between another journalist and Carter where he was called a vulture. The closest reference to the statement is an opinion by the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times: \u201cThe man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering. Might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene.\u201d", "However, in another article on the most iconic photos in the world, TIME magazine wrote, \u201cAs he took the child\u2019s picture, a plump vulture landed nearby. Carter had reportedly been advised not to touch the victims because of disease, so instead of helping, he spent 20 minutes waiting in the hope that the stalking bird would open its wings. It did not. Carter scared the creature away and watched as the child continued toward the center. He then lit a cigarette, talked to God and wept.\u201d", "Therefore, as it seems, Carter chased away the scavenger to help the child. He could not lift the child because journalists were advised to not touch victims of famine because of disease.", "There is no literature claiming that the vulture and the child photograph was the reason for his death. His work, overall, was emotionally demanding and he often experienced existential lucidity that came with surviving violence again and again. He often used drugs to cope with his miseries. \u201cCarter had bounced from romance to romance, fathering a daughter out of wedlock,\u201d reads the TIME piece hinting at an unstable personal life. Carter\u2019s suicide note mentioned in TIME talked of financial troubles. He wrote: \u201c\u2026depressed \u2026 without phone \u2026 money for rent \u2026 money for child support \u2026 money for debts \u2026 money!!! \u2026 I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings & corpses & anger & pain \u2026 of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners \u2026 I have gone to join Ken if I am that lucky.\u201d", "Ken was one of Carter\u2019s closest friends who had died of a bullet wound covering violence in South Africa\u2019s Tokoza in 1994, close to a month before Carter committed suicide. His death had devastated Carter who told his friends that he, and not Ken, should have taken the bullet. His work assignments covering violence and misery took a toll on his mental health. \u201cEvery photographer who has been involved in these stories has been affected. You become changed forever. Nobody does this kind of work to make themselves feel good. It is very hard to continue,\u201d he was quoted telling his friends. His work was not going well on the days leading up to his death. According to his friends, he had begun to openly talk about suicide.", "He committed suicide on July 27, 1994.", "It was later confirmed that the child mistaken to be a girl was a boy and he had survived the famine. However, he died 14 years later from malaria fever. Based on a WhatsApp forward, the Solicitor General blamed Carter for the child\u2019s death and claimed that during a conversation with another journalist he was called a vulture. There is no record of any such conversation and moreover, Carter had chased away the bird when he shot the photograph and the child had survived. An article in Pgurus also promoted the misinformation that Kevin Carter committed suicide due to the horrors of the Sudanese famine.", "Donate Now", "Nobody's cheerleader, I tweet at @samjawed65", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
