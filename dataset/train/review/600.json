But Pence was speaking about the actions of Trump, not his own.", "Pence\u2019s comments ignore Trump\u2019s multiple feuds, many times with Democratic governors, about state-federal responsibilities and pandemic response.", "A Trump campaign spokesperson sent us a list of dozens of tele-conferences and meetings that Trump or Pence had with governors including Democrats such as New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer.

There were shortages of testing supplies, as well as personal protective\u00a0gear. Washington state asked for 4.2 million N-95 respirators. It got a bit under 500,000. It asked for about 300,000 gowns.
