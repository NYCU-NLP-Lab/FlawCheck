We checked several claims from that address.", "In a 40-minute speech to supporters near Knoxville ahead of Super Tuesday, presidential candidate Rick Santorum framed the health care debate in terms of government power versus individual choice.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, he said on Feb. 29, 2012, \"wants that power in the hands of government. He wants to control your insurance policies and your access and the reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and how much insurance companies -- not how much they\u2019ll make, how much they\u2019re allowed to keep of the money they collect.\n\n\"That\u2019s already in place by the way. The federal government has a regulation in place already that tells health insurance companies how much money they\u2019re allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues. Fifteen percent -- that\u2019s what they can keep. That\u2019s how much money they get to keep to run their businesses.\"\n\nHe wrapped up the topic saying, \"they\u2019re going to micromanage everything because they don\u2019t believe in you.\"\n\nWe decided to check the claim that the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep just 15 percent of their revenues to use for operating expenses.\n\nMedical loss ratio\n\nSantorum didn\u2019t call it by this name, and we didn\u2019t hear back from his campaign for our story, but it appears he was referring to the medical loss ratio, a provision of the 2010 health care reform law signed by Obama and opposed by congressional Republicans.\n\nThe provision is similar to others already in place in several states. It \"requires most insurance companies that cover individuals and small businesses to spend at least 80 percent of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement, leaving the remaining 20 percent for administration, marketing, and profit. The \u2026 threshold is higher for large group plans, which must spend at least 85 percent of premium dollars on health care and quality improvement,\" according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There are other exceptions for small companies. (You can read Kaiser\u2019s full explainer on the medical loss ratio here.)\n\nInsurance companies that exceed those limits are required to pay the money back in rebates to their customers, beginning in 2012.\n\nWith large group plans required to spend 85 percent of premium income on health care, what\u2019s left is the 15 percent to which Santorum referred.\n\nAccording to John Rother at the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, the medical loss ratio \"was enacted to put pressure on insurers to become more efficient\" as well as to \"make sure that consumers and businesses got a fair deal on their premiums.\"\n\nTimothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., called it \"a pro-consumer regulation.\"\n\nThe idea behind, he said, is that \"when people purchase health insurance, they ought to have the money go to health care.\"\n\nRevenue not affected\n\nSantorum referred to health insurers\u2019 overall revenue -- \"what they receive\" -- but the provision applies only to revenue from premiums. In other words, of what you pay your insurer in premiums, 80 or 85 percent must be spent on your health care. It may not pay for television commercials or new office space.\n\nBut other sources of revenue may be used for those purposes.\n\n\"Many (insurance companies) have side businesses, offering IT services and other services that are sold to health providers,\" said Rother.\n\nAdded Jost: \"Some insurers are heavily invested, and that doesn\u2019t figure in at all.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not that they are limited to 15 percent of their income for all of their expenses. They\u2019re limited in their premium income,\" Jost said.\n\nWhile they may not account for all revenue, Robert Zirkelbach, press secretary for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, pointed out that premiums comprise the majority of insurance companies\u2019 revenue.\n\nExpenses not affected\n\nSome insurers\u2019 expenses, such as quality improvement efforts, taxes, regulatory fees and patient safety, do not have to come out of the 15 percent.\n\nJost said some things that previously were considered administrative costs are now specifically exempted, namely quality improvement costs that include wellness programs and patient safety.\n\n\"It does not limit the insurers\u2019 ability to work with doctors and hospitals to improve quality. Those costs are not charged against the 15 or 20 percent limit,\" Rother said.\n\nBut Zirkelbach said the cap also encompasses services that affect consumers, including services to help patients navigate complicated delivery systems, efforts to modernize technology and programs to prevent fraud and abuse.\n\nHis group raised concerns about the medical loss ratio when it was being debated, citing fears it would disrupt the health insurance market and inhibit innovation.\n\nA Government Accountability Office study found that the majority of established insurers would have already been in compliance with the medical loss ratio in 2010 if it had been in effect. Thus, most policy holders won\u2019t be getting a rebate this year, Jost said. But they\u2019re also likely avoiding premium rate increases that might have happened without the rule.\n\n\"It\u2019s \u2026 fair to say that many insurers are showing that they can meet this requirement without breaking a sweat,\" Rother said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSantorum said the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep only 15 percent of their revenues to run their businesses.\n\nHis description of the medical loss ratio provision of the health reform law doesn't tell the whole story. The rule does require large group insurance plans to spend 85 percent of their premium income on real health care. For small group plans the rule is more generous. All health insurance companies are still free to spend other streams of revenue however they wish, and several types of expenses are specifically exempted from the 15 (or 20) percent limit.\n\nSantorum\u2019s statement leaves out a good deal of important information.
