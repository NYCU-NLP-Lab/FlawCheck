Spicer, in his daily press briefing on Jan. 30, 2017, pushed back by claiming that the presidential memorandum announcing the makeup of the council hadn\u2019t really changed dramatically.", "\"The language that's part of the president's memo is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001,\" Spicer said, holding up copies of the various memos (around the 6:55 mark of this video). \"The only thing that's changed in this is the addition of the Director of National Intelligence as a position that didn't exist in 2001. For what it's worth, it's the same as Obama's, save for the word \u2018also.\u2019 \"", "For those who don\u2019t know, the National Security Council was established in 1947 and gathers foreign and domestic policy and military officials to advise the president on national security.", "The two issues with Trump\u2019s restructuring concern the makeup of the full council and its principals committee, a subset of senior officials that is also \"literally 100 percent the same,\" according to Spicer.", "So is Spicer right that the Bush, Obama and Trump memos are nearly \"identical\"?", "We read Bush\u2019s 2001 memo, Obama\u2019s 2009 memo and Trump\u2019s 2017 memo, and found that Spicer\u2019s claim is misleading.", "The regular council", "Spicer is right about the makeup of the full National Security Council, albeit in a limited way.", "This sentence \u2014 \"The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings\" \u2014 appears pretty much verbatim in each president\u2019s memo. (The Director of National Intelligence was a position created in 2004, so Bush\u2019s memo says the CIA Director instead.)", "But in a broader sense, Spicer is off the mark. Each president has invited different government officials to sit on the council, but neither Bush nor Obama added his chief strategist. Trump appears to be the only president since the establishment of the council to include his, Bannon, according to a Congressional Research Service report.", "By statute, the members of the council are the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense and, as of 2007, secretary of energy.
