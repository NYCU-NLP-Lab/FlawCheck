["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The Democratic debate in Flint, Mich., opened with a discussion of\u00a0the city\u2019s lead poisoning crisis, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Flint isn\u2019t the only place where serious action is needed.", "\"We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate,\" Clinton said. \"We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I\u2019m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board.\"", "We were curious about Clinton\u2019s claim that Cleveland has it worse.", "If you stopped listening there, you might have thought she was saying the tap water in Ohio\u2019s second-largest city is also contaminated with lead \u2014\u00a0which is not the case.", "Later in the debate, Clinton made a point of mentioning lead coming from other sources, too:\u00a0\"I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes,\" she said.", "The Clinton campaign cited an\u00a0article\u00a0in the\u00a0Cleveland Plain Dealer, and we found other reports and data that back her point.", "Lead poisoning leads to serious neurological and behavioral effects ranging from shortened attention spans and developmental disabilities\u00a0to coma and even death.", "While no level of lead is safe in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a reference level of 5 micrograms of lead per one deciliter of blood as an indicator of higher-than-usual blood lead levels. According to the CDC, 2.5 percent of American children age 5 and under \u2014 about a half million kids \u2014 test at this level.", "Residents of Flint have been consuming tap water with lead since 2014, when the city switched its water source to the polluted Flint River to save money. In 2015, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas had elevated blood lead levels, according to an analysis by Monica Hanna-Attisha, a researcher at Flint\u2019s Hurley Children\u2019s Hospital.", "Clinton has a point that many other American cities are dealing with the toxin. Lead-contaminated tap water has run through faucets in Washington D.C., Durham, N.C., Lakehurst Acres, Maine, Jackson, Miss. and other places throughout the years.", "But in most places, lead poisoning elsewhere is mainly due to lead-based paint in older houses.", "That\u2019s the case for Cleveland, where a whopping 14.2 percent of kids tested at the reference level in 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. In the county, 10.3 percent of kids had elevated blood levels.", "Cleveland and Cuyahoga County aren\u2019t exactly outliers. Looking at 2014 CDC surveillance data for 1,425 counties in 29 states, 288 counties have higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint. (We should caution that the data is far from perfect; for example, 100 percent of kids in Colfax County, N.M., tested positive, but the sample size was just 33 kids.)", "What\u2019s more, 15 counties had the same percentage or higher rates of poisoned children as Flint, but at double the reference blood-lead level:", "Our ruling", "Clinton said, \"We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint.\"", "In Flint, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas in Flint tested positive for lead poisoning in 2015. In Cleveland, that rate was 14.2 percent in 2014.", "However, the lead in Cleveland came from paint, not water, and Clinton's initial\u00a0phrasing made that unclear.\u00a0With this caveat, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly True.", "CNN,Democratic Presidential Debate in Flint, Michigan, March 6, 2016", "Email interview with Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Hillary Clinton, March 7, 2016", "Cleveland Plain Dealer, \"It's not about the water, but Cleveland has a higher rate of lead poisoning than Flint, Michigan,\" Feb. 4, 2016", "World Health Organization, \"Lead poisoning and health,\" Aug. 2015", "CDC, \"What Do Parents Need to Know to Protect Their Children?\" June 9, 2014", "CDC, \"Lead Prevention Tips,\" June 9, 2014", "CDC, CDC\u2019s National Surveillance Data (1997-2014), accessed March 7, 2016", "CDC, CDC\u2019s State Surveillance Data, accessed March 7, 2016 (compiled here)", "New York Times, \"Unsafe Lead Levels in Tap Water Not Limited to Flint,\" Feb. 8, 2016", "Environmental Health Perspectives,\u00a0\"Out of Plumb: When Water Treatment Causes Lead Contamination,\" 2009", "The Clarion Ledger, \"Lead, water: Still questions in Jackson,\" Feb. 3, 2016", "Cuyahoga County Board of Health, \"City of Cleveland NeighborhoodsConfirmed Elevated Blood Lead Levels (EBLs) for Children < 6 years of age January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2014,\" accessed March 7, 2016", "New York Times, \"Flint Is in the News, but Lead Poisoning Is Even Worse in Cleveland,\" March 3, 2016", "Detroit Free Press, \"State data confirms higher blood-lead levels in Flint kids,\" Sept. 29, 2015", "Mona Hanna-Attisha, \"Pediatric lead exposure in Flint, Michigan: A Failure of Primary Prevention,\" Sept. 26, 2015", "Mother Jones, \"Raw Data: Lead Poisoning of Kids in Flint,\" Jan. 25, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
