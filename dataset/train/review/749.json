["\u201cMEXICO: Police are being attacked and brutalized by the migrant caravan as illegal migrants attempt to force their way into Mexico,\u201d according to\u00a0a Facebook post widely shared in Canada.", "Other posts feature the same photo and two more, depicting Mexican policemen in different locations at different times. None of the photos were taken when the caravan of Central American migrants\u00a0began its journey through Mexico a few weeks ago, or\u00a0even in 2018.", "This image was taken in December 2014 in Chilpancingo, a town in the Mexican state of Guerrero. Cristopher Rogel Blanquet, the photographer, told AFP that the photo was taken a few months after 43 students from Ayotzinapa, in the same state, were reported missing.", "In one Spanish-language Facebook post that took his photo out of context, Blanquet (whose comment is circled in red) said:\u00a0\u201cThis photo is from Guerrero, I took it during clashes in Chilpancingo on September 14, 2014.\u201d Also circled in red, another internet user pointed out the real context for the photo.", "\u201cThat day, there was going to be a concert by Panteon Rococo, but in the early morning there were clashes between students and the federal police, which lasted until 10 in the morning, more or less,\u201d Blanquet recalled.", "Cristopher Blanquet\u2019s photo was published in the online gallery of Mexican newspaper El Universal, where he worked in 2014. The photojournalist also shared the image on his Facebook page.", "A Google reverse image search of this photo\u00a0leads to a February 2011 article, pictured below. According to the article, the policeman was injured in clashes \u201cafter a group 200-strong attempted to force its way into the city\u2019s center square in order to protest against then-president of Mexico Felipe Calderon\u2019s visit in Oaxaca.\u201d Various other media\u00a0reported\u00a0on the same incident.", "Also using Google reverse\u00a0image search, this photo is found\u00a0on an October 2012 post on the news website Aristegui Noticias. According to the report, the photo of the injured policeman is credited to Mexican journalist Gustavo Aguado. On October 24,\u00a0he confirmed\u00a0the origin of his photo himself after it was shared out of context.", "Although the images of injured\u00a0Mexican police officers are real, none of these photos depicts scenes from the migrant caravan that is crossing Mexico towards the United States in the past days. According to the UN, the caravan is estimated to include 7,000 Central Americans.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
