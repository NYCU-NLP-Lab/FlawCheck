Terrill)", "Kurt Cobain, Nirvana\u2019s late frontman, was known to push boundaries, both on and off stage, and was often outspoken about his beliefs and his personal life.", "His frankness has also brought about some falsities, though, and a fake quote attributed to Cobain is circulating the internet, claiming that, in 1993, the grunge rocker predicted and approved of a Donald Trump presidency. It first was reportedly posted to a Facebook page called \"Trump Train\" in 2016 and has since popped up in various forms.", "It resurfaced again in a post on Feb. 9. and reads: \"In the end I believe my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties are playing both sides from the middle and we\u2019ll elect a true outsider when we fully mature. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not a business tycoon who can\u2019t be bought and who does what\u2019s right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds.\"", "The meme was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The meme includes no sourcing or information about where Cobain made the prediction (besides the year 1993) and there is no record of Cobain ever saying it. The statement has also been debunked by several media outlets since it went viral.", "Moreover, one of Nirvana\u2019s former managers, Danny Goldberg, dismissed that the late singer ever said the words in an opinion piece for The Nation in August 2018.", "\"As one of Nirvana\u2019s managers when Kurt was alive,\" Goldberg wrote, \"I know that the quote is not only made up but it is also a grotesque perversion of Kurt\u2019s beliefs.\"", "It\u2019s also important to note that one of Cobain\u2019s most known political beliefs was his opposition to the rich and established. Famously, when he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1992, he wore a T-shirt that read \"Corporate Magazines Still Suck!\"", "And in one 1992 interview with Argentinian journalist Sergio Marchi, Cobain did discuss his preference to see someone \"who is not a professional politician\" become president. But he was equally clear on what he thought of business tycoon Ross Perot, then a third-party candidate: \"The guy sucks. He\u2019s rich; I don\u2019t trust him as president.\"", "A fake quote predicting a Donald Trump presidency attributed to the late Kurt Cobain has resurfaced online after circulating the internet for years.", "There are no records of Cobain saying the statement, and those who were close to him emphatically reject he did \u2013 or would \u2013 say the words.", "We rate it Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Feb. 9, 2019", "The Nation, The Kurt Cobain Donald Trump Hoax, Aug. 7, 2018", "FactCheck.org, Fake Kurt Cobain Quote about Trump, Nov. 15, 2018", "Spin, An Obviously Bogus Pro-Trump Kurt Cobain Quote Is Going Viral on the Right-Wing Internet, Aug. 3, 2018", "The Advocate, Kurt Cobain interview, Feb. 9, 1993", "Sergio Marchi interview with Cobain, Oct. 31, 1992", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
