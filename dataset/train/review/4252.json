Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018", "The Obama administration negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal struck with Iran that lifted key sanctions against that country in exchange for Iran's allowing independent monitoring to ensure they were winding down their nuclear program.

Fox News repeated that quote in their version of the report:", "\u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed.", "\u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d", "The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201d", "It's unclear where Zolnour, who is a critic of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and is considered a conservative hardliner, came up with the 2,500 figure (nor did the Fox News story provide any additional information on that front).

Amidst popular uprisings against a regime that many citizens consider corrupt, a number of high-ranking Iranian officials have sent their children or relatives to live in the United States. This situation has fostered resentment among Iranians who question why a privileged class are free to travel and live in the U.S. while President Trump's travel ban has rendered doing so impossible for most ordinary citizens.", "Nader told us that \"I don\u2019t know if there was a specific policy to let [Iranian officials' families] settle [in the U.S.]. But there is definitely a sense of anger in Iran that the regime basically represses Iranians and says 'death to America,' yet sends its children to study in the U.S. and live good lives while Iranians are suffering.\"", "Zolnour's comment, Nader added, was likely a \"clumsy\" dig at Rouhani. As Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian noted, both Trump and Zoulnor probably intended it as a slight against their domestic adversaries and not a genuine revelation of truth about an international agreement they consider disagreeable:", "Fars is also regularly used as a vehicle to slander foreign nationals imprisoned in Iran who are denied due process or the right to defend themselves.

Still, it boggles the mind that he would uncritically accept information from such a quarter.", "But Trump \u2014 just like Zolnour and his fellow thugs in the Iranian regime \u2014 has little interest in factual accuracy. He\u2019s far more interested in assailing his domestic foes (in this case, his predecessor in office). And in this sense, we see a striking overlap between Trump and the mullahs. It\u2019s a sort of call-and-response relationship.", "A CBS News report on this issue similarly concluded by stating that:", "Fox News noted in its story that there's no evidence to support Zolnour's claim. Zolnour is a hard-liner, and was using the claim as a cudgel against his more moderate foes in Tehran.
