["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 23, 2020", "In early October, about 2,100 voters in Los Angeles County accidentally received mail-in ballots that were missing the presidential race entirely. The county sent corrected ballots to them. But President Donald Trump appears to have twisted the episode to claim the ballots \u201chad everything on it\u201d except \u201cmy name.\u201d", "Trump made the claim in two campaign rallies. He told a crowd in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 20 about \u201cphony fake ballots,\u201d saying: \u201cHow about the ones that were printed without my name on it, right? They had everything on it. They had every race, they had everything. You had the Senate, you had everything, they forgot to put me down.\u201d", "In Macon, Georgia, on Oct. 16, he said: \u201cThey had one little problem on one set of ballots, thousands and thousands \u2013thousands. They forgot to put the name of Donald Trump on the ballot, other than that the ballot was quite good.\u201d", "We asked the Trump campaign for support for the claim, as did our fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact. Neither of us received a response. But, as PolitiFact noted, Trump mentioned the Los Angeles County incident in a tweet and in an Oct. 8 Fox Business interview, in which anchor Maria Bartiromo said: \u201cYes, more than 2,000 L.A. County ballots printed, mailed without presidential election \u2014 without the presidential race on the ballots.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cThey forgot to put my name on the ballot.\u201d", "To be clear, the printing error left off Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s name too, and the entire presidential race. It was not a partisan issue, and it was immediately corrected.", "The Los Angeles Times reported that about 2,100 of the absentee ballots without the presidential race were mailed on Oct. 5. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s office said on Oct. 6 that the \u201cprinting error\u201d affected \u201cone precinct in Woodland Hills,\u201d and had been corrected. \u201cReplacement ballots were mailed to ALL impacted voters today after reaching out last night through email and robocalls to inform them of the issue.\u201d", "\u201cWhile this has impacted a very small number of Los Angeles County voters \u2013 we believe the faulty ballots were mailed to a single precinct of just over 2,100 voters, out of a total of more than 5.6 million registered voters in the County \u2013 we nevertheless apologize to those affected by the mistake,\u201d the registrar-recorder/county clerk\u2019s office said in an Oct. 6 statement.", "The office encouraged voters to discard the mistaken ballots, but said if voters had already returned them, \u201cwe will cancel their original ballot once their new ballot is received.\u201d", "The claim is part of a pattern of Trump misleadingly or falsely describing unintentional ballot or ballot application errors, usually in key swing states.", "In Georgia, Trump included several examples of what he called \u201ca big con job,\u201d saying, \u201cwe have to be very, very careful with the ballots\u201d:", "Pennsylvania. He mentioned \u201cmilitary ballots that had the name Trump on them and they\u2019re in a garbage can.\u201d", "In September, nine military ballots \u2014 seven cast for Trump \u2014 were found in a trash can in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. State elections officials have since said the ballots were discarded in error, according to the Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The state deputy secretary for elections told the paper military and overseas ballots sometimes are mailed in envelopes that are not clearly marked as ballots.", "Ohio. \u201cThey found 50,000 ballots from Ohio,\u201d Trump said. No one \u201cfound\u201d the ballots.", "As we\u2019ve written, the Franklin County Board of Elections said in an Oct. 9 press release that \u201c49,669 voters received an inaccurate ballot,\u201d promising to have correct ballots mailed out in 72 hours. \u201cWe want to make it clear that every voter who received an inaccurate ballot will receive a corrected ballot,\u201d the board said. \u201cStringent tracking measures are in place to guarantee that a voter can only cast one vote.\u201d", "North Carolina. \u201cThey find them from North Carolina, dumped in a river,\u201d Trump claimed.", "We don\u2019t know what \u201criver\u201d incident he\u2019s talking about, but 11,000 inaccurate pre-filled voter registration applications \u2014 not ballots \u2014 were sent to North Carolinians from Civitech, a technology vendor that works with companies and campaigns to increase voter registrations, the North Carolina State Board of Elections said in an Oct. 6 press release. Civitech\u2019s COO apologized and promised to send out \u201ccorrected mailers with blank applications to all affected NC recipients.\u201d", "Wisconsin. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, when asked about other claims by Trump that ballots had been found in a \u201criver,\u201d said on Oct. 1 he was talking about \u201ca ditch in Wisconsin\u201d instead.", "Later that day, Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said that no Wisconsin absentee ballots were in the three trays of mail found in a ditch in Greenville, Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. \u201cShe said she did not know if there were ballots from other states,\u201d the paper said.", "Virginia. \u201cThey find them, I think, 500,000 ballots in Virginia,\u201d Trump falsely said. \u201cThey were incorrect, they\u2019re printing them wrong.\u201d", "These were faulty ballot applications \u2014 not ballots \u2014 mailed to 580,000 mostly Fairfax County residents by the nonprofit Center For Voter Information with the wrong information. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this organization was acting maliciously, they just were not very diligent in their follow-through,\u201d Gary Scott, the county general registrar and director of elections, told ABC7.", "On Sept. 17, Trump\u00a0accused another swing state, Michigan, of plotting against him.", "Trump claimed in a tweet that Michigan\u2019s secretary of state \u201cpurposely misprinted Ballots for the Military, putting the wrong names on the Ballot, and actually listing a member of another party as a replacement for Vice President @Mike_Pence.\u201d He claimed it was \u201cdone illegally.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence anything was done purposely for the approximately 400 overseas and military ballots that may have been affected. Trump\u2019s name was on them, but Pence\u2019s wasn\u2019t.", "Instead, the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential candidate was listed as Trump\u2019s running mate. A spokeswoman for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told the Detroit Free Press that this was \u201ca temporary error in the (Qualified Voter File) data that caused some ballots downloaded (Tuesday) to display incorrect ballot information when clerks downloaded the (Qualified Voter File) ballot sent to military and overseas voters. Approximately 400 ballots were downloaded by clerks during this period; we don\u2019t know how many were sent.\u201d", "For more on Trump\u2019s false mail-in ballot claims, see our story \u201cTrump\u2019s Repeated False Attacks on Mail-In Ballots.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: Swing State Watch\u00a0is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
