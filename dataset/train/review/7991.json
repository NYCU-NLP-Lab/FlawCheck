["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 3, 2020", "A video suggesting that there\u2019s been \u201cvoter fraud\u201d in Utah has been circulating online, but all it actually shows is a misunderstanding of a poll worker\u2019s mistake on the first day of early, in-person voting. The mistake was corrected and the system worked, as intended.", "A video titled \u201cVOTER FRAUD? YOU TELL ME\u201d began circulating on social media a week before Election Day, causing confusion and concern among the hundreds of thousands of Instagram users who saw the original video.", "Despite the suggestion in the title, the video doesn\u2019t show voter fraud.", "Here\u2019s what it does show:", "A Utah voter named Taylor Zundel seated in a car, suggesting that her husband may have been a victim of voter fraud.", "\u201cI just think this is important to know and I think people should know this is happening and I just think it\u2019s important,\u201d she says in the recording.", "Zundel explains her experience and suspicions this way:", "\u201cMy husband gets his little voter card, he goes to the machine to vote and it says that he\u2019s already voted, which, he hasn\u2019t\u2026 he goes to the desk back where we checked in\u2026 they call somewhere in Salt Lake and clear his vote\u2026 He\u2019s able to vote. Great. But a few things cross my mind: First of all, who did he, apparently, vote for? I don\u2019t know. And they couldn\u2019t tell him. They couldn\u2019t tell who he voted for. Fine.\u00a0 Who did he vote for, though? Second of all, what if he hadn\u2019t voted this year? \u2026Like, again, who on record did he [vote for]? \u2026And then third, is it really that easy to just go and clear a vote? Because, if it is, that\u2019s a little scary. But, was it really cleared, I guess is what I\u2019m trying to say, also. Was it really cleared or was it just, like, another vote?\u201d", "\u201cIt just, it doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she says.", "But what really happened isn\u2019t mysterious.", "Salt Lake County has unrestricted in-person voting locations, so voters don\u2019t have to vote within their precincts, Sherrie Swensen, the Salt Lake County clerk who is in charge of elections, told us in a phone interview. They can vote at any location in the county.", "When voters show up, poll workers check them in and program a card for each voter based on their address. That card is inserted into the voting machine and the machine\u00a0displays the appropriate ballot for that voter\u2019s precinct on the touchscreen. The county has posted a\u00a0video\u00a0showing the process.", "Zundel and her husband, Colten Page, went to an early voting location in Draper City on the first day it was open, Oct. 26, Swensen said.", "The poll worker who checked in Page made a mistake and missed a step on the system to set up the card, neglecting to select \u201ccreate ballot style,\u201d Swensen said. By missing that step, the ballot for Page\u2019s precinct wasn\u2019t created and, instead, showed a blank ballot on the touchscreen.", "\u201cIt was the first day of early voting,\u201d Swensen said. \u201cThey were a little nervous, and she missed one step.\u201d", "The generic error message on the machine says: \u201cThis voter access card is already voted. Please remove it from the machine,\u201d Swensen told us, explaining, \u201cthat\u2019s built in as the generic message, built into the machine.\u201d", "As Zundel says in the video, Page was able to go back to the poll worker and get the problem fixed so that he could vote. But, again, there was nothing nefarious in how that was done, either.", "The poll worker called the Election Help Desk so the card could be cleared and recreated. It could then display the correct ballot for Page, Swensen said.", "So, the poll worker didn\u2019t \u201cclear a vote,\u201d as Zundel suggested. Rather, she cleared the card. There was no vote to clear, since Page hadn\u2019t been shown a ballot, and there would be no way to \u201cclear a vote\u201d from the system once it has been cast, Swensen said.", "\u201cI can understand her concern,\u201d Swensen said, but the Salt Lake County Clerk\u2019s office explained all this to Zundel in a public message on Instagram and offered to walk her through the process in person. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested,\u201d Swensen said.", "Zundel didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment sent to her Facebook page, where she also shared the video.", "Despite the county clerk\u2019s public explanation, the video spread even further when it was featured on Herman Cain\u2019s website, which became The Cain Gang after his death from COVID-19 in July. The story on that website didn\u2019t include any mention of the clerk\u2019s explanation (which was posted the day before), and instead carried this misleading headline: \u201cInstagram Testimony: People Are Showing Up to Vote and Being Told They Already Voted.\u201d It was billed as \u201ccommentary.\u201d", "Statewide, Utah had not received many complaints about potential voter fraud, Justin Lee, the director of elections, told us in a phone interview.", "Of the complaints that have been made, Lee said that, like this one, they \u201chave been very easy to explain.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
