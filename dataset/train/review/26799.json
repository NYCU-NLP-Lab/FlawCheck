Trump, the Manhattan real estate mogul who boasts about his wealth, maintains a fleet of aircraft and sells his own brand of neckties, paid respects on Sunday to an incongruous constituency.", "\u201cLook at all these bikers,\u201d Mr. Trump, standing before a crowd in front of the Lincoln Memorial, said with admiration. \u201cDo we love the bikers? Yes. We love the bikers.\u201d", "Mr. Trump was addressing a gathering at the 29th annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle run, a vast event over Memorial Day weekend that is dedicated to accounting for military members taken as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action.", "While it is true that police reported making no arrests at the Rolling Thunder rally, an estimated 5,000 people showed up to the event \u2014 a far cry from the 100,000 mentioned in the meme. Trump reportedly took some issue with the official numbers:", "The presumptive Republican nominee was also apparently disappointed with the crowd size \u2013 organizers estimated about 5,000 people were in attendance \u2013 arguing that there were 600,000 people who wanted to hear his speech but weren\u2019t allowed in.", "Trump complained, \u201cI thought this would be like Dr. Martin Luther King, where the people would be lined up from here all the way to the Washington monument, right? Unfortunately, they don\u2019t allow \u2018em to come in,\u201d without explaining who \u201cthey\u201d are or where these 600,000 people were hiding.", "While it's true that Donald Trump appeared at a motorcycle rally over Memorial Day weekend and that no one was arrested, the event wasn't specifically to support the presidential candidate, but to draw attention to prisoners of war and people gone missing in action. The photograph that was used to illustrate the meme's sentiment was not taken at either the 2016 Rolling Thunder event or a Donald Trump rally. It appeared on the internet as early as September 2013 and depicted the \"2 Million Bikers to DC\" event on 11 September 2013.", "Benen, Steve. \u00a0 \"Trump Takes the Wrong Message to the Wrong Crowd in the Wrong Way.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 MSNBC. \u00a0 31 May 2016.", "Kaplan, Thomas. \u00a0 \"Donald Trump and Bikers Share Affection at Rolling Thunder Rally.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 29 May 2016.", "NPR. \u00a0 \"'Bikers for Trump' Leader Says Candidate Has 'Untied fhe Tongue of America.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 30 May 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
