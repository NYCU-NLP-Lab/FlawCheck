All countries in the EU parliament elect representatives through a proportional voting system, though the methods differ.", "However, not everyone tasked with shaping European law is elected by the public. The European parliament is one of three legislative arms of the European Union. Another arm, the European Commission, whose members aren\u2019t elected by the public but can propose laws and allocate funding, has previously been criticised by some for being undemocratic.", "It is also true there are 650 members of the House of Commons, Parliament\u2019s lower house and they are elected by the public.

Life peers are notable individuals who are put forward by the Prime Minister or the House of Lords Appointments Commission, with leaders of other political parties allowed to suggest additions for political balance. Their given title, Baron or Baroness, cannot be passed to any descendants.", "Hereditary peers are peers who have inherited their title. They used to make up almost all of the House of Lords, until the 1999 House of Lords Act, which removed all but 92 hereditary peers from the House Of Lords, 90 of whom were elected by fellow hereditary lords and represent political parties or are cross-bench. If a\u00a0 hereditary peer in the House of Lords dies, steps down, or is removed from their role, a successor to that space is voted by other hereditary members of the House Of Lords. The two other roles are held by the incumbent Earl Marshall and Lord Great Chamberlain, which are roles passed down hereditarily. \u00a0 There are currently 26 Lords Spiritual, 87 accepted hereditary peers, and 659 life peers.", "The House of Lords works to check and challenge the work of parliament.
