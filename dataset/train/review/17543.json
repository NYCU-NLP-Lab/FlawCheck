["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 21, 2019", "Viral social media posts attribute a quotation about how \u201cto anger\u201d a conservative and a liberal to President Theodore Roosevelt.

I don\u2019t believe Theodore Roosevelt would have used this rhetorical juxtaposition.\u201d", "Roosevelt was a Republican who rose from vice president to the presidency in 1901 following the assassination of President William McKinley.

Republicans renominated Taft, but then Roosevelt ran in the general election under a newly formed Progressive Party, or the \u201cBull Moose Party.\u201d Democrat Woodrow Wilson ultimately won that election.", "Sidney Milkis \u2014 a professor in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia, who co-authored the book Theodore Roosevelt, the Progressive Party, and the Transformation of American Democracy \u2014 also questioned the idea that Roosevelt said the quotation in question.", "\u201cI have never seen this, and doubt very much it is authentic,\u201d Milkis said in an email. Roosevelt \u201ccalled reformers Progressives, and ran [as] a third party candidate on the Progressive Party ticket. Not until the New Deal was the dimension of conflict between liberals and conservatives.\u201d", "(The New Deal \u2014\u00a0under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s \u2014 was a series of government projects, programs and reforms in response to the Great Depression.)", "It\u2019s not just social media posts that have wrongly attributed the quotation to Roosevelt.", "It\u00a0appeared, for example, in a December 2016 opinion piece about the 2016 election in the literary magazine the New Criterion.
