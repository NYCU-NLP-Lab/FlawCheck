She said would you like to meet up for a drink ... We had two hours in a pub. She had a couple of dirty martinis and a couple of pints. We got along brilliantly. Then I put her in a cab. And it turned out to be a cab that took her to a party where she met Prince Harry. And then the next night, they had a solo dinner together and that was the last I ever heard from Meghan Markle. And I have never heard from her again. Meghan Markle ghosted me\u2026I really liked her this is why it hurts. No... I really liked her. I just think she\u2019s a slight social climber, I\u2019m afraid... I didn\u2019t really like being ghosted like that. I thought it was a strange thing to do.\u201d", "Morgan has told this story on several different occasions.
