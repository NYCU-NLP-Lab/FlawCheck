["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on November 5, 2020", "An inaccurate graphic on a local TV station briefly showed one Pennsylvania county with more mail-in votes\u00a0than the number of ballots it had received. The graphic was quickly corrected, but Facebook users are now sharing screenshots of it to misleadingly suggest it is evidence of voter fraud.", "Post-election Facebook posts are circulating an image of a local news station\u2019s implausibly high mail-in vote tally, with some misleadingly suggesting it is evidence of voter fraud. The tally, however, mistakenly included both in-person and mail-in ballots.", "One post\u00a0on Nov. 4, which has since been removed but was archived by the fact-checking website Lead Stories, shows part of a man\u2019s arm and various on-screen vote totals for Lancaster County in Pennsylvania.", "According to the image, 142,584 mail-in ballots had been counted, even though only 89,681 had been returned and 108,539 had been requested. \u201cJust in case your wondering how biden is gonna win,\u201d the post reads.", "Another Nov. 4 post shows the same photo and asks, \u201cAnyone see a problem with this?\u201d Some 60 other iterations of the same claim were shared on Facebook.", "The photo is real but is not evidence of voter fraud, as some posts imply.
