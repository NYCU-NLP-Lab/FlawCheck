Follow our post-election coverage here.", "U.S. President Joe Biden signed a flurry of executive orders after his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021, many of them reversing policies of former President Donald Trump. Subsequently, Trump supporters online began casting doubt on the legitimacy of these orders and drawing negative comparisons between his process and Trump\u2019s, often with little evidence.", "One particular video shared by the Facebook page PolitiChatter claimed that Biden was not signing real executive orders, but just blank pieces of paper. In the clip, someone is shooting a video of what appears to be a television broadcast of Biden's signing. The camera zooms in on the pages Biden signs and a voiceover claims no writing is visible on those pages. \"These people are faking this!\" the voiceover claims.", "The video was low quality and overexposed, making any writing on the white pages illegible. However, we found higher quality images from the same Jan. 21 event Getty Images' library. We verified this was the exact same event by comparing stills from the video to what Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were wearing that day and the location of the signing ceremony.", "WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 21: U.S. President Joe Biden signs an executive order as Vice President Kamala Harris looks on during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House January 21, 2021 in Washington, DC.

As some photographs\u2019 colors are adjusted to show higher contrast, print on white paper becomes more visible, something that isn\u2019t apparent in all images that may be edited in post-production.", "By contrast, the PolitiChatter video is overexposed, and details in the photograph appear lightened, including Biden's tie, Harris' outfit, and the white pieces of paper he signed.", "Furthermore, Biden\u2019s full list of executive orders is published on the White House website. We thus rate the above claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
