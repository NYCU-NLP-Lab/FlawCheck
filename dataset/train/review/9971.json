Jeb Bush said at a Republican presidential debate in South Carolina.", "\"She\u2019s under investigation with the FBI right now,\" Bush said Jan. 14. \"If she gets elected, her first 100 days \u2014 instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the court house.\"", "Actually, Clinton is not under FBI investigation. The inquiry to which Bush refers revolves around the private email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state. \u00a0And it is not a criminal investigation.", "Here are the facts.", "In July 2015, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent what is called a security referral to members of the executive branch. A security referral is essentially a notification that classified information might exist in a location outside of the government\u2019s possession. In this case, the location was Clinton\u2019s private email server.", "Soon after, the New York Times incorrectly reported that the inspectors general requested a criminal investigation into Clinton\u2019s email use \u2014 as opposed to a security referral.

The referral was in connection with Clinton\u2019s account, not whether Clinton herself mishandled information, and did not allege criminal activity.", "Officials told reporters at the time that the FBI was not targeting Clinton specifically.", "As part of its inquiry, the FBI has looked into the security setup for Clinton\u2019s home server and a thumb drive that has copies of Clinton\u2019s work emails.

It\u2019s even unclear at this point whether the FBI probe is just a preliminary inquiry or if it has evolved into a true investigation, according to Politico.", "Describing the inquiry, FBI Director James Comey told Congress in October 2015, \"The FBI is working on a referral given to us by inspectors general in connection with former Sec. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\"", "He declined to give any more specifics.", "Earlier this month, Fox News reported that the FBI was broadening its investigation to look into whether any connection between the State Department under Clinton and the nonprofit Clinton Foundation violated public corruption laws. Clinton denied that FBI was pursuing this line of inquiry.", "However, Fox bases its report on unnamed sources, so we cannot independently verify it, nor have any major media outlets.", "Bush\u2019s campaign and the FBI did not respond to our requests for comment in time for publication.", "Our ruling", "Bush said Clinton is \"under investigation with the FBI right now.\"", "Not quite. The FBI is conducting a general inquiry into the security of Clinton\u2019s private email server. But law enforcement officials have said Clinton herself is not the target of the inquiry, and it is not a full-blown criminal investigation.", "Clinton\u2019s actions are clearly front-and-center in an FBI investigation.
