The gang grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s.", "For this fact check, we examined the tweet about Harris. We also reviewed similar attacks.", "Harris repudiates claim", "The White House did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the claim. Harris strongly rejected it, replying to the White House on Twitter:", "\"As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That\u2019s being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.\"", "Harris was California\u2019s attorney general and San Francisco\u2019s district attorney before she was elected to the Senate in 2016.
