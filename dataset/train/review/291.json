We\u2019ve seen them win state House races in Wisconsin. We\u2019ve seen them win big mayor\u2019s races in New Hampshire. Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected.\"", "We wanted to know whether Democrats gained 50 seats formerly held by Republicans since Trump\u2019s election.", "The bulk of Lewandowski\u2019s count is backed up by legislative races. The trend even played out in the very district Lewandowski was trying to keep red, with Good beating out Buchanan for the Sarasota seat on Feb. 13.", "However, we could not verify Lewandowski\u2019s exact figure because he is counting small municipal elections, which can be hard to track. We could not reach him for this fact-check.", "Many experts we spoke to referred us to an analysis by Daily Kos Elections, which shows that Democrats took 36 seats, as of Feb. 11, 2018. (The Daily Kos is liberal political website. We verified the races on the spreadsheet.)", "The total includes special election victories, such as Democrat Doug Jones\u2019 win over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama and the special election for a state Senate seat in Wisconsin\u2019s 10th District.", "It also includes regular elections. For example, Democrats picked up 15 seats in the Virginia statehouse and a few more seats in New Jersey on Election Day in 2017.", "The Daily Kos list, however, doesn\u2019t include Democrat Phil Murphy\u2019s win over Republican Kim Guadagno in the general election to succeed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.", "The New Jersey governor\u2019s race brings the initial total to 37 Democratic gains.", "We found a slightly lower total from Geoffrey Skelley, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Skelley found that Democrats have gained 33 seats on net in special elections for state and federal legislature and elections in New Jersey and Virginia.", "Unlike the Daily Kos, Skelley\u2019s net total reflects that Republicans took three seats away from Democrats in special elections and one seat away in New Jersey.", "From here, we tried to find examples of municipal races where Democrats won seats from Republicans \u2014 not an easy task. There is no database of smaller municipal elections nationwide. Further, municipal elections are often nonpartisan races, so candidates aren\u2019t officially latched to one party or the other.", "With those limitations, we searched news stories. An article by the Huffington Post about \u00a0\"historic victories\" by Democrats on Nov. 7, 2017, includes two clear-cut examples of Democratic mayoral candidates beating Republican incumbents, including the Manchester, N.H., mayor\u2019s race that Lewandowski mentioned in his speech.", "Adding those races to the highest number of state-level wins brings our verified total to at least 39 flipped seats for Democrats.", "Regardless of the exact number, there\u2019s no denying Lewandowski\u2019s point: Democrats have won a significant number of elections since Trump won the presidency.", "\"Bottom line is that President Trump is energizing the Democratic Party,\" said Nathan Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns for Congress, governorships and president.", "Skelley said that the shift \"reflects the pendulum-swing nature of politics.\"", "\"Given the fact that Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats during Obama\u2019s time in office, including a multitude of losses in his first midterm cycle in 2010, I don\u2019t think Democratic gains in the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency are unprecedented,\" Skelley said.", "Lewandowski said, \"Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected.\"", "We found evidence of almost 40 seats that flipped from Republican to Democratic control since Trump took office. The bulk happened at the state legislative level.", "However, Lewandowski is also counting small municipal elections, which are harder to track. We found a couple of examples of Democratic mayors beating Republican incumbents. Beyond mayor\u2019s races, it\u2019s hard to say a seat flipped when some local elections are nonpartisan.
