["A controversy over a harmless advertisement by jewellery brand Tanishq featuring an interfaith couple was blown out of proportion due to social media vitriol. The company\u2019s brand manager Mansoor Khan\u2019s social media profiles were circulated with threatening messages, forcing him to eventually take down his accounts. The jewellery brand succumbed to the outrage and pulled down the advertisement two days after its release. But Tanishq made fresh headlines on October 14 after NDTV claimed that its Gandhidham store was attacked and the manager was forced to write an apology note. Twitter user \u2018The Skin Doctor\u2019 posted an alleged call recording with the branch manager refuting reports that the store was \u2018attacked\u2019.", "This is fake news.
