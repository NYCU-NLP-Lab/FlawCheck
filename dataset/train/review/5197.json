["About this rating", "On 17 March 2016, an image purportedly showing two tweets from Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, each stating that Americans should vote for the Democratic candidate if\u00a0Donald Trump wins\u00a0the 2016 GOP presidential nomination began circulating online:", "Neither of the above-displayed tweets\u00a0appeared on the official Twitter accounts of Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. Rather, this image was created with an application such as \"Let Me Tweet That For You,\" which allows users to easily create fake tweets:", "One way to tell that this image is not on the level is that neither tweet it includes is accompanied by Twitter's blue \"verified\" symbol:", "The tweets also contradict what both politicians have said about supporting the Republican nominee in the past.\u00a0Cruz and Rubio have both repeatedly asserted they would support whoever won the Republican nomination, although Rubio said that it was getting \"harder every day\" to stick to that pledge:", "\"I don\u2019t know. I mean, I already talked about the fact that I think Hillary Clinton would be terrible for this country. But the fact that you're even asking me that question, I still at this moment continue to intend to support the Republican nominee, but it's getting harder every day.\"", "Cruz avowed that the only way he would not support Donald Trump for president would be if the candidate shot someone on Fifth Avenue (a tongue-in-cheek reference to an earlier controversial campaign statement made by Trump).", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
