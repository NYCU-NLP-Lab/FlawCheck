["The video has circulated on social media, including in this post on Facebook with a caption that reads: \u201cThe moment Borno state governor Zulum\u2019s convoy was under attack the third time.\u201d", "The post\u2019s accompanying footage has been viewed more than 165,000 times since September 28, 2020, according to data provided by social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.", "The post was published barely a day after fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) -- a splinter group of the Boko Haram jihadist group -- opened fire on the convoy of Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state, in restive northeast Nigeria.", "Zulum\u2019s convoy had previously suffered two similar attacks -- one on September 25, 2020, near the town of Baga on the shores of Lake Chad, and the other in July 2020 outside Baga.", "Nigerian activist Deji Adeyanju, who has had posts debunked by AFP Fact Check here and here, also published the same claim on Facebook.", "Adeyanju\u2019s now-deleted video has spread to Twitter and Instagram, as well as on Nairaland, Nigeria's most-visited domestic social network. Many of the comments suggest online users believe the viral clip was filmed in Nigeria, while others were sceptical or dismissive.", "But AFP Fact Check found the claim to be false. Although insurgents have indeed launched several attacks on Zulum\u2019s convoy this year, the viral footage has been shared in a misleading context.", "Using the InVID WeVerify tool, AFP Fact Check ran several reverse image searches on keyframes of the video. We found that the video clip features in this report published on January 18, 2020, on the website of Kenyan newspaper The Standard.", "According to the report, the clip shows Kenyan police dispersing crowds gathering for a political rally in Mumias, in the country\u2019s western region of Kakamega.", "Kenya\u2019s license plate numbers", "The white license plate numbers seen on vehicles in the video also provide additional clues.", "However, since the numbers appear blurry, AFP Fact Check used The Standard\u2019s video with higher quality, as well as a similar video of the scene shot from a different angle by Kenya Citizen TV to verify the license plate numbers.", "The plate number starting with \u201cKCS\u201d is among one of the series of Kenya\u2019s fourth generation of number plates.", "AFP Fact Check used the website of World License Plates, which collects license plates from various countries, to determine the plate numbers seen on the vehicles in the videos match those in Kenya and differ from those in Nigeria.", "Meanwhile, in The Standard\u2019s video, we observed that the front plates of vehicles are black on white, while their rear plates are black on yellow. This matches the description of Kenya\u2019s plates on the website of World License Plates, and our fact-checkers in Nairobi confirmed this to be the case.", "Using multimedia content from other countries to portray\u00a0Nigeria is not uncommon in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked many such misleading claims, including an image of a damaged portion of asphalt road in Thailand that was passed off as an example of\u00a0shabby road networks in Nigeria\u2019s southern region.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
