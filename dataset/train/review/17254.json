["About this rating", "Social media erupted with expressions of outrage in early October 2017 after WJBK, a Fox Television affiliate in Detroit, reported that a novice firefighter, 41-year-old Robert Pattison, was fired for bringing a watermelon to the station as a gift for his new co-workers at Engine 55 in the Joy-Southfield neighborhood of Detroit.", "Although showing up on one's first day with a gift (usually doughnuts) is a firehouse tradition, Second Battallion Chief Shawn McCarty told Fox 2 News, 90 percent of Engine 55's firefighters are black, and some took offense at Pattison's choice of offerings:", "FOX 2: \"Is it racially insensitive to bring a watermelon into a firehouse?\"", "\"To some people,\" McCarty says.", "FOX 2 spoke to Pattison by phone, who claims it was not a joke \u2014 and he did not mean to offend his fellow firefighters. But he clearly did. Fire Commissioner Eric Jones says the Fenton native was officially discharged.", "Certain foods, notably watermelon and fried chicken, acquired racially charged significance when they were used to caricature and dehumanize black Americans during the long period of segregation in the South following the Civil War. As William Black explained in a 2014 article in The Atlantic:", "The trope came into full force when slaves won their emancipation during the Civil War. Free black people grew, ate, and sold watermelons, and in doing so made the fruit a symbol of their freedom. Southern whites, threatened by blacks\u2019 newfound freedom, responded by making the fruit a symbol of black people\u2019s perceived uncleanliness, laziness, childishness, and unwanted public presence. This racist trope then exploded in American popular culture, becoming so pervasive that its historical origin became obscure.", "Although mixed, social media responses to the announcement of Pattison's termination appeared to sharply favor the sentiment that Detroit officials overreacted by firing him:", "?
