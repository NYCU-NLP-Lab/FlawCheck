["Michael Dieffenbach scored a perfect 36 on the ACT college preparation test in 2011 while a senior enrolled in the Wisconsin Virtual Learning School.

Scott Walker.", "\"Test scores dropped Wisconsin from second in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam.\"", "Such a free-fall should have produced blaring headlines.", "But there was not even a mention of a 41st ranking in stories by Wisconsin\u2019s leading news organizations about the scores, which had been announced a day earlier by the Department of Public Instruction.", "It turns out the Democratic Party came up with 41st on its own -- by mixing apples and oranges.", "Scores announced", "What made headlines from the announcement by the Department of Public Instruction were scores by younger students on a different test, the Badger Exam.", "More than half of Wisconsin's public school students in grades three through eight -- 51.2 percent -- were proficient or advanced in English language arts in 2014-\u201915, and 43.7 percent did as well in math.", "Meanwhile, the department\u2019s release of the ACT scores got lesser billing in the news reports.", "That release stressed that the 2014-\u201915 school year marked the first time in Wisconsin that all juniors (11th grade) in public high schools had the opportunity to take the test. That\u2019s because testing fees were paid by the state.", "In other words, the more than 64,000 juniors comprised a unique group in terms of Wisconsin students who have taken the ACT over the years.", "Traditionally, when state rankings on the ACT are done, the scores are for graduating seniors -- and include students from private as well as public high schools.", "Now to the scores.", "The ACT -- which tests in English, reading, writing, math and science -- is scored on a scale of 1 to 36.", "Wisconsin\u2019s composite score for the public school 11th-graders for 2014-\u201915 was 20, according to the department\u2019s news release.", "But the way to think about that score is a baseline. There won\u2019t be a score to compare it to until the next set of public school 11th-graders takes the test.", "Meanwhile, the composite for the more than 46,000 graduating seniors -- the group whose scores are traditionally used to rank the states -- was higher: 22.2.", "The department made a point to state that comparisons between the two scores -- given that they are for two different groups of students -- are \"invalid and flawed.\"", "But that\u2019s what the Democratic Party did in its news release.", "The party took the 20 score for Wisconsin\u2019s juniors and plugged it into the ACT database that compares state scores for graduating seniors.", "That database clearly shows that Wisconsin\u2019s score for the traditional group, the graduating seniors in 2014-\u201915, was 22.2 (the same score as the previous year).", "The new score put Wisconsin, once again, second among states where more than half of the graduating seniors took the ACT -- behind Minnesota, which had a score of 22.7.", "Among all states, Wisconsin\u2019s 22.2 ranked 18th.", "But the Democratic Party, using the 20 score for the group of juniors, said that score meant Wisconsin tied with Kentucky for 41st place.", "A spokesman for the ACT told us the party\u2019s claim \"cannot be supported\" because it is \"not an apples to apples comparison.\"", "And when we shared that with Brandon Weathersby, spokesman for the Democratic Party, he acknowledged the party had \"flubbed\" the data.", "Our rating", "The state Democratic Party said Wisconsin dropped \"from second in the country to 41st\" among states where more than half the students took the ACT college preparation exam.", "The party admits it erred, by comparing scores of two different groups of students. In fact, Wisconsin ranked second in the 2014-\u201915 ACT testing among states where more than half the students took the exam, not 41st.", "For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.", "Wisconsin Democratic Party, news release, Jan. 14, 2016", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Latest Wisconsin test performance: 51% proficient in reading, 44% in math,\" Jan. 13, 2016", "Interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Brandon Weathersby, Jan. 15, 2016", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"Citing collective bargaining law, Scott Walker says Wisconsin\u2019s rank on ACT test has risen to second (Mostly False),\" June 12, 2015", "Interview, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction officials John Johnson and Thomas McCarthy, Jan. 15, 2016", "Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, Badger Exam news release, Jan. 13, 2016", "Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, ACT news release, Jan. 13, 2016", "Email interview, ACT senior media and public relations director Ed Colby, Jan. 14, 2016", "Wisconsin State Journal, \"State releases result from Badger Exam, the one-off standardized test that is already history,\" Jan. 14, 2015", "ACT, 2015 ACT average scores by state, accessed Jan. 15, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
