The irregularities, the NCGOP argued, didn\u2019t affect enough votes to make a difference in the outcome of the race.", "Fast forward to March. The NC elections board has called a special election in the 9th district, and the GOP is raising money to help whoever its candidate ends up being in September.", "In doing so, the party is misleading donors about the history of the race.
