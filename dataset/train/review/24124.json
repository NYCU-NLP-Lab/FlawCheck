Brat, according to The New York Times, is not known for groundbreaking research of his own.", "How did Brat conclude he\u2019ll be the only economist in the House?", "Brian Gottstein, spokesman for Brat\u2019s campaign, said the information came from Congressional Quarterly, \u00a0which compiles profiles for each member of Congress.", "\"We did not count those House members that have undergraduate economics degrees but aren\u2019t career economists,\" Gottstein e-mailed.", "We found a January 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service that breaks down House members\u2019 occupations into 20 categories which, unfortunately, did not include economists. Almost half of the members had careers either in law, business or banking.", "Another CRS report from August, although not exhaustive, drilled down a little further on the occupations of members of Congress.
