Wildlife officials have reportedly confirmed that the animal did not experience any serious injuries.", "Earlier reports suggested that name had been \"carved\" into the mammal's back, resulting in \"serious scarring,\" but this was not accurate.", "In mid-January 2021, Florida wildlife officials announced that they were investigating the illegal harassment of a threatened Florida manatee after it was discovered that the word \u201cTrump\u201d was etched into the mammal\u2019s back.", "The incident was first reported by the Citrus County Chronicle, a newspaper in Crystal River, Florida, on Jan. 11, 2021. That report said that someone had \u201cscraped\u201d the U.S. president\u2019s name into the mammal\u2019s back. That same day, the Center for Biological Diversity published a news release that claimed the word was \"carved\" into its back and that the animal suffered \"serious scarring in the form of the president's name.\"", "A video of the manatee subsequently received worldwide coverage and went viral when media personality Exavier Pope shared a video of the mutilation on Twitter.", "The manatee was discovered in North Florida\u2019s Homosassa River on Jan. 10. But it is important to note that these earlier reports have since been revised after it was confirmed that \u201cTrump\u201d was not carved into the animal\u2019s back, but rather written into its algae. Manatees are slow-moving animals that live near the surface of warm and tropical waters, making their backs and tails ideal for algae to grow.

With a range-wide population of at least 13,000 \u2014 about half of which are in Florida \u2014 the so-called sea cows are threatened, meaning that they are likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.", "\"West Indian manatees are essential members of the ecosystems in which they inhabit and are protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,\" said Aurelia Skipwith, director of the FWS, in a statement emailed statement to Snopes.", "Due to their threatened status, these vegetarians are protected under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978. It is illegal to interfere with manatees under Florida state and federal laws, including harassing, harming, wounding, or annoying the sea cows.
