["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on September 23, 2020", "President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign claims a video it posted on social media shows Joe Biden botching the Pledge of Allegiance. But Biden\u2019s words were taken out of context. He wasn\u2019t trying to recite the full pledge, as the post could lead some to believe.", "The 8-second clip was posted Sept. 22 by the \u201cTeam Trump\u201d Facebook account and the \u201cDonald J Trump\u201d YouTube account. \u201cJoe Biden completely botches the Pledge of Allegiance,\u201d the captions say.", "The accompanying video shows the Democratic presidential nominee saying: \u201cI pledge allegiance to the United States of America. One nation, indivisible, under God, for real.\u201d", "The quote has also been shared by others on different social media platforms.", "However, a fuller clip from Biden\u2019s Sept. 21 campaign speech in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, shows he mentioned certain phrases from the Pledge of Allegiance only to make a point. He wasn\u2019t reciting the pledge. He said\u00a0that as president, he wouldn\u2019t divide the country, as he claimed Trump had done by criticizing how \u201cblue states\u201d have managed the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Biden, Sept. 21: Think about what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you\u2019re not his problem. He has no obligation to you. He\u2019s not responsible for you as president, your family or your well-being. I don\u2019t see the presidency that way. I don\u2019t pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America, I pledge allegiance to the United States of America. One nation, indivisible, under God, for real. I\u2019m running as a proud Democrat, but I\u2019m not going to govern as a Democratic president, I\u2019m going to govern as president.", "The short clip posted by the Trump campaign doesn\u2019t make Biden\u2019s intent clear.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
