Brian Sandoval\u2019s office says the issue is essentially settled through the state\u2019s broadly focused anti-discrimination laws.", "Lawmakers in 2011 expanded the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression. Because these \"public accommodation\" laws cover \"place(s) of education,\" presumably school districts can\u2019t segregate transgender students from using the gendered bathroom they identify with without violating state law.", "\"No change in policy is necessary and the Obama administration has no need to have concerns about Nevada schools,\" Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin said in an earlier statement.", "So how does the anti-bullying bill \u2014 SB504 \u2014 fit into the debate?", "Nestled in the bill are several new definitions of bullying, including \"blocking access to any property or facility of a school.\"", "The Alliance Defending Freedom brief uses that definition, along with the addition of gender identity or expression into classes protected by the legislation, to argue that it creates a \"new right\" for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice.", "Sanson, one of the \"insurgent Republicans\" running against Anderson, referred to the ADF brief in several blog posts on his website, which also included letters from Assembly members Hansen and Shelly Shelton.", "\"President Obama recently federally mandated all locker-rooms and bathrooms be designated \u2018gender-neutral\u2019, but it was already Nevada law because of Anderson\u2019s leadership,\" Hansen said in a letter.", "Anderson called the brief \"irrelevant\" in an interview with PolitiFact.

There is no clearly defined mandate in Nevada state law regarding transgender student access to bathrooms and locker rooms, and school districts around the state have very different standards county-to-county.
