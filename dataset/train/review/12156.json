["On June 30, a protest rally was taken out in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh over the recent incident of lynching of Tabrez Ansari in Jharkhand. The next day i.e. on July 1, the Hindi publication Hindustan, which belongs to the Hindustan Times group, published an article in its Meerut edition headlined, \u201c\u0906\u0908\u090f\u0938\u0906\u0908\u090f\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u091d\u0902\u0921\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0932\u0939\u0930\u093e\u090f \u0917\u090f !\u201d (ISIS flags were also waved!- translation). There are two photographs published along with the article. In one of the photos, a black and white striped banner can be seen. In the other photo can be seen two black coloured flags. Hindustan (Meerut Edition) July 1, 2019", "The article meanwhile states, \u201cBJP leaders have complained to the police alleging ISIS flags were waved during the peace rally. A video has also been released and a complaint has been filed with the intelligence bureau. It has been alleged that the flag is of an organisation involved in anti-national activities. It has also been alleged that such organisations were behind the rally. The matter should be investigated. On the other hand, the organisers of the rally claimed that they were the flags of the Jamiat Ulema\u201d (translated from Hindi). Interestingly, the online version of this article has qualified this statement about ISIS flags with a question mark, unlike the e-paper version.", "It may be noted that the write-up exclusively states that BJP leaders have made this allegation of ISIS banners being waved at the rally. However, the headline of the article explicitly states that ISIS flags were waved. Interestingly, Alt News found that the Lucknow edition of the newspaper has a different title, with no mention of ISIS flags. Instead, it has been reported with the narrative that the BJP has alleged that ISIS flags were waved at the rally.", "Hindustan (Lucknow Edition) July 1, 2019", "According to reports, police resorted to lathicharge after the crowd turned unruly and pelted stones at police personnel present at the spot.
