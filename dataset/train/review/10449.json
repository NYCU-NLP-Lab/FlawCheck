["About this rating", "An image of an elephant standing near a tram with its mouth open is frequently shared on social media, attached to an odd story about the Kray twins, who were two of the most feared mobsters in London during the 1950s and 1960s and whose glittering, violent lives as nightclub owners turned organized crime leaders have been memorialized in popular culture.", "The elephant supposedly was connected to the start of their \"reign of terror\" in London:", "The caption says:", "The Kray twins began their reign of terror by using a stolen elephant to extort protection from trams, 1960.", "Unfortunately, none of this is true. The image does not feature the Kray twins, it was not taken in 1960, and it does not show the beginnings of any sort of reign of terror, unless you have an unusual definition of the word.
