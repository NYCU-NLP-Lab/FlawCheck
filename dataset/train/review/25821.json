["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on November 16, 2016 | Corrected on December 13, 2016", "House Speaker Paul Ryan falsely claimed that \u201cbecause of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.\u201d The law actually improved Medicare\u2019s financing, and the program isn\u2019t going \u201cbroke.\u201d", "After a 2016 campaign virtually devoid of talk about Medicare policy, Ryan\u2019s recent remark on Fox News \u2014 flagged\u00a0by our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post \u2014 was a blast from the past. The comment is like something right out of the Medicare-filled 2012 election, a contest so packed with scary claims about seniors\u2019 health care that we dubbed it \u201cA Campaign Full of Mediscare.\u201d Both President Obama\u2019s and Mitt Romney\u2019s campaigns \u2014 with Ryan as Romney\u2019s running mate \u2014 spread falsehoods\u00a0about what their opponent would do to\u00a0Medicare.", "As we wrote then, both campaigns had proposed ways to shore up Medicare\u2019s shaky financing, but they disagreed on how best to do that.", "In his recent comments, Ryan said that since part of the Affordable Care Act concerned Medicare, a repeal of the law would impact the program. But then Ryan went off into the realm of Mediscare.", "Ryan, Nov. 10 on Fox News:\u00a0So what a lot of folks don\u2019t realize is this 21-person board called the IPAB is about to kick in with price controls on Medicare. What people don\u2019t realize is because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke. Medicare is going to have price controls. Because of Obamacare, Medicaid is in fiscal straits. So you have to deal with those issues if you are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Medicare has got some serious problems because of Obamacare. So those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare.", "Let\u2019s start with the claim that Medicare \u201cis going broke.\u201d It isn\u2019t. One part of Medicare, though, is expected to face financial shortfalls in the future without changes to either revenues or spending, or both.", "Medicare is made up of four parts. What was originally enacted in the 1960s is Part A, which covers payments to hospitals, and Part B, which covers payments to physicians. Other parts were added later \u2014 Part C (Medicare Advantage, or private insurance options) and Part D (prescription drug coverage). Part A is funded by a payroll tax that goes into a trust fund, similar to Social Security trust funds,\u00a0while the physician and prescription drug aspects of Medicare are mainly paid for with general government revenues.", "It\u2019s that Part A trust fund that\u2019s expected to run out of money. The current exhaustion date is 2028, according to the latest report from the Medicare trustees. \u201cHI [hospital insurance trust fund] expenditures have exceeded income annually since 2008. However, the Trustees project slight surpluses in 2016 through 2020, with a return to deficits thereafter until the trust fund becomes depleted in 2028,\u201d the 2016 trustees report says.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean Medicare would be \u201cbroke.\u201d There are other parts of Medicare, and Part A would still have revenue through payroll tax receipts, though not enough to\u00a0cover all of the expected expenses.", "\u201cHI revenues would cover only 87 percent of estimated expenditures in 2028 and 80 percent in 2050,\u201d the trustees report says.", "Predictions of financing shortfalls have surrounded Part A almost since\u00a0it became law in 1965. By\u00a01970, the trustees report projected that \u201cthe trust fund would be exhausted in fiscal year 1973, unless additional financing is provided.\u201d", "In 1980, exhaustion was expected in 1994; in 1990 the insolvency date was 2003. But Congress has repeatedly pushed back those dates, mainly through increasing taxes \u2014 both the payroll rate and wages subject to the tax. Right now, that tax rate is 1.45 percent on wages for employees and employers each, with no ceiling on wages subject to the tax since 1993.\u00a0(The Affordable Care Act added a Medicare surcharge on high-income wage earners, as we will explain later.)", "To be sure, Congress will need to act again to push back the current exhaustion date for the Part A trust fund. The trustees report urges policymakers to \u201cdetermine effective solutions to the long-range HI financial imbalance.\u201d But it is an exaggeration to say that Medicare is going broke.", "We\u2019ve fact-checked similar claims from both Republicans, including Ryan, and Democrats in the past.", "As for Ryan\u2019s claim that Obamacare had worsened Medicare\u2019s financing, that\u2019s not the case, either. In fact, the law both expanded Medicare funding \u2014 adding a 0.9 percent tax on earnings above $200,000 for single taxpayers or $250,000 for married couples \u2014 and cut the growth of future spending.\u00a0Additional revenue and savings actually extend the life of the trust fund.", "The trustees\u2019 2010 report estimated that the ACA had added 12 years to the life of the Part A trust fund. \u201cThe financial status of the HI trust fund is substantially improved by the lower expenditures and additional tax revenues instituted by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese changes are estimated to postpone the exhaustion of HI trust fund assets from 2017 under the prior law to 2029 under current law.\u201d The trustees also put the exhaustion date at 2028 under an \u201calternative scenario\u201d in which not all of the ACA changes or existing physician-payment changes, which Congress has repeatedly overridden, are enacted. This presents a \u201cmore plausible outcome for future spending,\u201d says the Medicare actuary.", "Republicans have long lambasted the ACA for reducing future growth in Medicare spending \u2013 which was estimated at\u00a0$716 billion in savings over 10 years, primarily by reducing the future growth of payments to hospitals. But cutting future growth in spending improves Medicare\u2019s financing. That\u2019s the opposite of what\u00a0Ryan claimed.", "As we\u2019ve written before, experts, including Medicare\u2019s own chief actuary, have doubted that all of the ACA cuts would be implemented as planned. \u201cMany experts doubt the feasibility of such sustained improvements and anticipate that over time the Medicare price constraints would become unworkable and that Congress would likely override them,\u201d the 2010 trustees report said.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Ryan\u2019s own budget plan in 2011-2012 actually kept some of the law\u2019s cuts to the growth in Medicare spending. (In 2012, the Romney campaign argued that the ACA double-counted the savings \u2014 both to extend the life of the Part A trust fund and pay for other aspects of the law \u2014 and that it was a \u201craid\u201d on Medicare. But, as we explained, that\u2019s how government accounting works:\u00a0After Treasury issues a bond that it will have to pay later, it can, and often does, spend the money it received on other things. Whenever Medicare wants to cash in trust fund bonds, however, Treasury must pay them.)", "In his comments to Fox News, Ryan mentions a \u201c21-person board called the IPAB\u201d that would enact \u201cprice controls on Medicare.\u201d The Independent Payment Advisory Board \u2014 created by the ACA \u2014 is tasked with making recommendations on how Medicare can cut costs.", "The 15-member, independent board \u2014 which would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 would make binding recommendations if Medicare spending exceeded certain levels. But no one has yet been appointed to this board, and its actions haven\u2019t been triggered, due to slow growth in per-enrollee health care spending. In other words, the IPAB hasn\u2019t been formed because it hasn\u2019t been needed.", "As the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation explains\u00a0in a July 2016 report, the IPAB process is set to be triggered for the first time next year, based on the Medicare actuary\u2019s most recent spending projections. Without a board in place, the secretary of Health and Human Services would be tasked with making the recommendations for spending growth reductions, to start in 2019.", "Under the ACA, the IPAB\u2019s (or HHS secretary\u2019s) recommendations could be replaced by other measures passed by Congress to reduce spending, or overridden altogether. But that would require a three-fifths majority in each house. The board is limited in what it can do. It can\u2019t raise taxes, premiums or cost-sharing; restrict benefits; or otherwise ration care.\u00a0According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, any recommended reductions\u00a0would come from \u201cMedicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services, and durable medical equipment.\u201d", "And with a new administration coming into office in January, it\u2019s unclear what would happen to these provisions of the law. But if the growth in spending were to be reduced \u2014 whether through IPAB or other means \u2014 that would improve the outlook for Medicare\u2019s financing.", "Correction, Dec. 13: We originally wrote that Part A was the only part of Medicare first enacted in the 1960s. Part B was also enacted then. We have corrected the error. We also made clear that it is Part B and Part D that are mainly paid for with general government revenues.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0276d17e-86b0-4ceb-84e2-296349dd45d3", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
