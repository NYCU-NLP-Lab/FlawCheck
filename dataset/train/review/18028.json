["About this rating", "On 12 September 2016, the web site Newslo published an article claiming that conservative rocker Ted Nugent had used a racially pejorative term when discussing San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand during pre-game playings of the U.S. national anthem:", "Recently, NRA board member and musician Ted Nugent attacked President Obama for saying that NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is \u201cexercising his constitutional right\u201d not to stand for the national anthem, calling it a sign of Obama\u2019s racism. Nugent, who has threatened to kill Obama, referred to the president as a \u201cchimpanzee\u201d and \u201csubhuman mongrel,\u201d and claimed he\u2019d be \u201cdead or in jail\u201d by 2013 if the president was re-elected, told radio host Joe Pags that Obama \u201cis the biggest racist in America.\u201d \u201cNo one is oppressed in America unless you choose to be oppressed,\u201d he added.", "\u201cLet me just clarify on what we\u2019re seeing here, and what we\u2019ve been seeing in America since 2008,\u201d Nugent loaded his guns while preparing to go on another rant. \u201cWe have this guy, right, who happens to be the president, and he spends most of his time regretting tragedies that have transpired because of \u2018guns\u2019 and the fact that people are allowed to protect themselves and their property by any means necessary. At the same time, he constantly screams about democratic values and how they\u2019re not being respected in this country.\u201d", "\u201cHowever, when a mediocre \u2014 and I mean that \u2014 when a mediocre football player insults millions of Americans and the country that gave him a shot at greatness by sitting down while the national anthem is being played, Obama changes his tune and says the Constitution grants such a \u2018liberty.\u2019 Well, excuse me, Mr. President, but I\u2019ve read the Constitution several times and nowhere does it say that chimps get to invoke human rights. And by \u2018chimp,\u2019 I\u2019m on this occasion referring primarily to the has-been quarterback. Now, therein lies a paradox. How does, in fact, a chimpanzee get to invoke human rights? I mean, that\u2019d be like turkeys trying to invoke PETA or something during Thanksgiving,\u201d Nugent fired away.", "Like all items published by\u00a0 Newslo (and sister sites\u00a0 Religionlo and\u00a0 Politicalo), the article's first paragraph was based on actual remarks made by its subject (in this instance, Ted Nugent), the lead-in lifted from the web site\u00a0 Right Wing Watch's 12 September 2016 coverage of Nugent's speaking about President Obama and Kaepernick. But the material following that lead-in was fabricated, particularly the portion where Nugent was quoted as saying he'd \"read the Constitution several times and nowhere does it say that chimps get to invoke human rights.\"", "Across Newslo's three fake news sites (frequently attributed in Facebook shares to the\u00a0 Politicops domain) articles present a button enabling readers to \"show facts\" or \"hide facts.\" But all articles appear in \"hide facts\" mode by default, obfuscating reader ability to highlight untruths:", "Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo articles typically begin with a paragraph of fact-based information and subsequent embellishments to exclusion.", "Previous Newslo fabrications includ items asserting Chris Christie surmised a female Viagra would lead to an increase in \"lesbianism\" (and that he voted down a gender pay parity bill for religious reasons), an Alabama politician suggested saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for all food stamp recipients, Ted Cruz said the death of Antonin Scalia was suspicious, televangelist Pat Robertson said David Bowie was still alive after his death, Mike Pence opined that if abortion was allowed in instances of rape that women would try to \"get raped\" in order to obtain an abortion, and the father of Brock Turner lamented the absence of punishment for the victim in his son's case.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
