["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The Republican Party of Texas marveled \u2014 not in a good way \u2014 at an admission of sorts by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the long-stalled health care overhaul before Congress. According to an e-mail the GOP sent Friday, Pelosi said \u201cthe Democrats have to pass their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually find out what's in it.\u201d", "Talk about a banana-peel moment. Did Pelosi improbably denigrate her party\u2019s promised legislation and say people can find out what\u2019s in it after it passes?", "GOP spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the text of Pelosi\u2019s March 9 speech in Washington to the National Association of Counties.", "We learned, for starters, that while the Texas GOP thinks the legislation is terrible, Pelosi clearly doesn't. Instead, Pelosi's remarks celebrate aspects such as a ban on denying health coverage because of a pre-existing conditions, \u201crobust support for public health infrastructure,\u201d more spending on community health centers and reductions in uncompensated care by hospitals. Pelosi also says in the speech that the plan won't require anyone to pay a deductible for preventive health care doctor visits.", "She summarizes: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very exciting.\u201d", "Yet there\u2019s heft to the GOP's claim that Pelosi said the legislation has to pass so people can find out what\u2019s in it.", "Pelosi adds: \u201cBut we have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.\u201d", "Pelosi's words stirred critics from the right including Marguerite Higgins, a senior editorial services associate at The Heritage Foundation. In a blog, Higgins named the moment the video of the week and called Pelosi\u2019s statement a \u201cstunning demonstration of political condescension.\u201d", "Separately, Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly offered this interpretation of Pelosi's comment: \"She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what\u2019s actually in the bill. Once it\u2019s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it.\"", "Capital fusses aside, we wondered if Pelosi spoke accurately; will the plan need to pass before people know what's in it?", "We called the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has posted side-by-side comparisons online of health care plans approved by the House and Senate. Its spokesman, Craig Palosky, reminded us that Congress posts the entire legislation online.", "Of course, that's not to say the final deal is settled \u2014 or, it stands to reason, open to public view.", "Palosky declined to comment precisely on Pelosi's forecast, saying her comment seemed more about politics than policy. \"It\u2019s not our role to police such comments,\" he said. \"If you want to know what members of Congress are doing, you have to speak to members of Congress.\u201d", "His nudge led us to call U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, among a handful of physicians in Congress and an opponent to the Democrats' proposal.", "Burgess told us it's often true that the ins and outs of legislation aren't widely known until after a measure passes into law; that held true, for instance, for the Republican-steered measure providing government aid toward prescription drugs for seniors.", "Pelosi's \"right,\" Burgess said, though \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good strategy (to declare as much). I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone actually broadcasting that.\"", "So how does the GOP's statement shake out?", "The party's e-mail errs when it makes it sound as if Pelosi thinks the health-care measure is terrible. It's very much the opposite.", "But it accurately quotes Pelosi as saying people will find out what's in the plan after it passes.", "We rate the statement as Mostly True.", "E-mail, Republican Party of Texas, March 12, 2010  The Heritage Foundation, The Foundry (blog), \u201cVideo of the Week: \u201cWe have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it,\u201d March 10, 2010  Interview, Craig Palosky, director of communications, Kaiser Family Foundation, March 15, 2010  Interview, Brendan Daly, communications director, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, March 15, 2010  Interview, U.S. Rep.
