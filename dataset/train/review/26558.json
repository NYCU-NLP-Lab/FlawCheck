Gwen Moore described Milwaukee as one of the worst places in the country for child sex trafficking, there were reasons to think it might be so.", "In the space of two weeks in early 2012, two Milwaukee pimps were sentenced to long prison terms. One, who had painted the words \"Ho Hauler\" on his van and shipped child prostitutes to Chicago and elsewhere to sell sex, got 30 years behind bars. The other, who gained fame in movies and on television as \"Pimp Snooky,\" had prostituted scores of women and girls in cities from Milwaukee to Las Vegas for at least 16 years, according to federal prosecutors. He got 20 years.", "Still, it was startling on May 20, 2014 when Moore spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill that aims to help underage victims of prostitution.
