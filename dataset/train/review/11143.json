["\u201cMuslim leaders in France strongly criticise decision to ban the slaughter of poultry animals in line with Islamic principle,\u201d reads a March 20, 2021 tweet of an article about a decision to \u201cban\u201d halal slaughter of poultry in France.", "The headline of the article has since been updated by Turkish state-owned media TRT, and the article no longer describes France\u2019s move\u00a0as a ban.", "But\u00a0many tweets denounced the supposed measure as another example of discrimination, with one even claiming that all halal meat had been banned and calling for a boycott of France.", "The claim also circulated in an Arabic-language article on Al-Jazeera, the headline of which claimed that \u201cFrance\u2019s Muslims reject decision to prohibit \u2018halal slaughter.\u2019\u201d", "Turkey\u2019s official Anadolu news agency\u00a0also shared the claim, in French.", "However, reports of a ban are false.", "The claims appear to stem from a March 18, 2021 press release from the Great Mosques of Paris, Lyon, and Evry, which have their own halal certification system.", "The document, which was signed by the three mosques\u2019 leaders, states that \u201cstarting in July 2021, the Halal ritual slaughter of poultry in France will no longer be authorized.\u201d", "The press release says the feared ban is the result of a technical note from the French Ministry of Agriculture, which oversees poultry slaughter in France.", "The ministry did publish a note regarding poultry slaughter on November 23, 2020\u00a0but it said the document aimed to provide detail on how various slaughter methods, including halal, are to take place in France.", "\u201cThis directive details different poultry slaughter practices within slaughterhouses and outlines methods for official control in respect of\u201d EU legislation, the document\u2019s summary reads.", "In an interview with AFP, Kamel Kabtane, president of the Lyon mosque, said: \u201cThe directive as it is written does not ban (halal slaughter), but it will greatly lower the quantity of poultry produced.\u201d", "\u201cWith these norms, it will become impossible for Muslims to consume\u201d according to their religious rules.", "Halal slaughter in France is allowed as a religious exemption to legislation passed by the EU in 2009. That law regulates how animals should be immobilized and stunned before slaughter, to avoid pain and minimize their distress.", "Marion Giroud, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture, said by email that the exemption for halal slaughter was decreed on December 28, 2011 and the November directive \"simply brings further precision to the former conditions for its application and control.\"", "She added, \u201cNo end to the exemption was pronounced as a result of this directive.\u201d", "EU legislation mandates that poultry must lose consciousness and sensibility after they are stunned, and maintained in that state until death. Two types of ritualistic slaughter\u00a0are authorized in France as exemptions to this rule.", "In one case, the animal is not stunned, but must be immobilized and in a way that does not let its weight rest on the legs or head before slaughter.", "In the second case, the waterbath stunners used to deliver an electroshock to the animal may have a lower intensity than allowed by the EU.", "The new French directive requires that the loss of consciousness must be controlled all the way to the animal\u2019s death.", "Kebtane said: \u201cVery few slaughterhouses have the restraining conditions that the ministry requires, and not all companies will be able to get the necessary equipment.\u201d", "There are currently roughly 8,000 animals slaughtered per hour, but the restraining devices would only allow the slaughter of 3,000 per hour, he said.", "\u201cYou see the difference.\u201d", "Officials from the Paris\u00a0and Evry mosques did not respond to requests for comment.", "With its large Muslim population, France is the hub for halal production and distribution in Europe, according to the US Department of Agriculture.", "The claims are circulating against\u00a0the backdrop of legislation passed by France\u2019s lower house of parliament in February 2021 to address what President Emmanuel Macron called \u201cIslamist separatism,\u201d or the perceived shutting off from mainstream secular society by certain French Muslims.", "Critics saw the legislation as further stigmatizing the country\u2019s millions of followers of the faith, and pushing them to cling more closely to their religious or community identities.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
