["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "In the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan repeated three times the claim that the Obama administration called Syrian president Bashar al-Assad a \"reformer.\"", "Three times during the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan accused the Obama administration of being soft on Syrian president Bashar Assad.\n\nThe administration, Ryan said, \"called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.\" He repeated the claim twice more in the 90-minute debate.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look. First, some background.\n\nAssad\u2019s family has maintained a tight grip on power in Syria for decades. As the Arab spring rippled across the region in early 2011, Syria began to experience unrest, with protests emerging both in the capital, Damascus, and Deraa, a relatively remote city near the Jordanian border.\n\nWhat happened in Deraa in March 2011 became the spark that ignited a widespread revolt that has now morphed into a bloody civil war.\n\nSeveral schoolchildren were arrested in late February 2011, accused of scrawling graffiti on a school that said \"the people want to topple the regime,\" according to CNN. When residents found out that the boys were beaten and tortured in prison, they sought their release but were rebuffed.\n\nOn March 18, security forces opened fire on protesters in Deraa, killing at least four, according to Human Rights Watch. \"Within days, the protests grew into rallies that gathered thousands of people,\" according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe comment Ryan referenced came just over a week after the killings in Deraa, on the March 27, 2012, edition of CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, which included an appearance by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Schieffer asked Clinton how the situation in Syria was different than in Libya, where the U.S. took action against a repressive government.\n\nClinton: \"Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s yet clear what will occur. What will unfold? There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he\u2019s a reformer. What\u2019s been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning. But there\u2019s a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities, then police actions, which frankly have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see.\"\n\nThe comments quickly drew criticism in some quarters. For instance, four days later, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote, \"Few things said by this administration in its two years can match this one for moral bankruptcy and strategic incomprehensibility. \u2026 It was hoped that President Assad would be a reformer when he inherited his father\u2019s dictatorship a decade ago. \u2026 Wrong. Assad has run the same iron-fisted Alawite police state as did his father,\" Hafez Assad.\n\nWe will not judge the wisdom of what Clinton said, but rather analyze whether Ryan correctly characterized what she did say.\n\nRyan did get the timing right. Though the conflict would eventually get much bloodier, Syrian guns had already killed several people in Deraa by the time Clinton made her comment. In fact, the show opened with a report from Tripoli covering the spread of the Arab spring, with the reporter saying that Syria\u2019s government acknowledged that 12 people were killed, more than 200 wounded as protests and demonstrations spread across that country.\"\n\nAs for invoking \"Russian-provided guns,\" it certainly sounds plausible. Russia is Syria\u2019s biggest supplier of weaponry, and Russia\u2019s arms trade with Syria totaled about $1.5 billion, making Damascus Moscow\u2019s seventh-largest client, according to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\nWhere Ryan may have gone too far was in saying that the administration \"called Bashar Assad a reformer.\" While Clinton did use the word, she said, \"Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he\u2019s a reformer.\"\n\nSo, Clinton didn\u2019t exactly say that she, or the administration, was labeling Assad a reformer. Rather, she was referring to what other people -- namely \"lawmakers\" --\"believe.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan said the Obama administration \"called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not quite what Clinton said; instead, she was describing what she understood lawmakers\u2019 views to be. Still, as a secretary of state speaking on national television, her decision to discuss such beliefs without knocking them down suggests that she lends them at least some credibility. On balance, we rate Ryan\u2019s claim Half True.", "Joe Biden, transcript of vice presidential debate in Danville, Ky., Oct. 11, 2012\n\nCBS, \"Face the Nation\" transcript, March 27, 2011\n\nBBC, \"Syria profile,\" accessed Oct. 11, 2012\n\nCNN, \"Daraa: The spark that lit the Syrian flame,\" March 1, 2012\n\nDmitri Trenin, \"Why Russia Supports Assad\" (New York Times op-ed), Feb. 9, 2012\n\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute, Arms Transfers Database, accessed Oct. 11, 2012\n\nCharles Krauthammer, \"Syria\u2019s \u2018reformer'\" (Washington Post op-ed), March 31, 2011", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
