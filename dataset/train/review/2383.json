["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 12, 2019", "Viral Facebook posts falsely claim that President Donald Trump \u201cstole\u201d charitable donations meant for veterans. A court ruled Trump illegally used his foundation for political purposes when it held a fundraiser for veterans, but all of the money raised went to veterans\u2019 groups.", "President Donald Trump was recently ordered to pay $2 million to several charities to settle a lawsuit over the dealings of his now-defunct charitable organization, the Trump Foundation. But social media posts have distorted the facts about the court order to falsely claim that the foundation \u201cstole\u201d money earmarked for veterans.", "\u201cIt is a fact that draft dodger Trump stole charitable cash donations that were meant for our Veterans,\u201d Facebook posts read.", "A different popular post says that a veterans\u2019 event hosted by Trump raised \u201c$2.6M\u201d but that \u201cNONE of the veterans groups that were supposed to get the money got a single dime. It all went to the campaign.\u201d", "Yet another post \u2014 a meme referring to former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling during the national anthem \u2014 reads: \u201cIf you believe a black man kneeling to peacefully protest racism dishonors veterans but Donald Trump stealing $2.8 million in charity from veterans doesn\u2019t \u2014 you need to stop disguising your racism as patriotism.\u201d", "Those posts, spread during Veterans Day, misrepresent the facts of the case and the court order that resolved it.", "The order finalized a settlement between the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office, Trump and the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Then-state Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a lawsuit against the Trump and his foundation in June 2018. The state accused the organization of \u201ca pattern of persistent illegal conduct, occurring over more than a decade, that includes extensive unlawful political coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions to benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business interests, and violations of basic legal obligations for non-profit foundations.\u201d", "One specific example cited was a \u201cnationally televised fundraiser Mr. Trump held in lieu of participating in the presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on January 28, 2016.\u201d That Iowa fundraiser was billed as a special event for veterans; its website, donaldtrumpforvets.com, featured the name of the Trump Foundation and noted that it was a nonprofit.", "According to the final settlement, the fundraiser raised about $5.6 million \u2014 \u201cof which $2.823 million was contributed to the Foundation; the balance was contributed by donors directly to various veterans\u2019 groups.\u201d But the attorney general argued the fundraiser was actually carried out by Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and unlawfully leveraged for political purposes.", "State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla, in her Nov. 7 court order, wrote that the $2.8 million donated to the Trump Foundation \u201cwas used for Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign and disbursed by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign staff, rather than by the Foundation,\u201d in violation of state law. However, she acknowledged that \u201cthe Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.\u201d", "Records obtained by the state show donations totaling $2.825 million were given to 34 veterans organizations between January 2016 and June 2016.", "So, it\u2019s false to claim that Trump \u201cstole\u201d the money and that \u201cnone of the veterans groups that were supposed to get the money got a single dime.\u201d", "Instead, the judge agreed that the foundation \u2014 through the fundraiser and the subsequent grants to veterans groups (which were announced at campaign events) \u2014 was illegally used for political activities. Scarpulla\u00a0wrote that a \u201creview of the record, including the factual admissions in the Final Stipulation, establishes that Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation.\u201d", "\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s fiduciary duty breaches included allowing his campaign to orchestrate the Fundraiser, allowing his campaign, instead of the Foundation, to direct distribution of the Funds, and using the Fundraiser and distribution of the Funds to further Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign,\u201d the order noted.", "While the state argued that the judge should order Trump to pay $2.823 million in damages based on the fundraiser matter, Scarpulla set the amount at $2 million.", "The Trump Foundation agreed in late 2018 to dissolve as part of the settlement with the state. The foundation agreed to donate its remaining assets of $1.78 million \u2014 along with the newly announced $2 million in damages to be paid by Trump \u2014 to eight reputable charities.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
