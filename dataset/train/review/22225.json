All of these claims, as portrayed in the following tweet, are misleading.", "#PredatorPresident ???\nCreepy photos of Trump crashing a wedding and trying to kiss the bride were just posted https://t.co/l3s4immjh7 via @anteksiler", "\u2014 Impeach Trump; Assault on Democracy (@ciel225) August 16, 2019", "The image is a screen capture from a video taken at the July 20, 2019, wedding of PJ and Nicole Mongelli, who held their nuptials at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

PJ Mongelli was not looking on in dismay while Trump kissed his bride, but was instead pumping his fist and chanting, \"USA! USA! USA!\" Both bride and groom were clearly ecstatic, an emotion they expressed in an interview with Fox News two days after their wedding.", "A post shared by SND321 (@snd321) on Jul 20, 2019 at 7:08pm PDT", "PJ Mongelli said the internet reaction to their sudden moment of fame on account of the president's appearance at their wedding has been \"disgusting.\" He said his wife was forced to set her Instagram account to \"private\" because of a flood of disturbing comments, some of which were derogatory and graphic.", "\"I don\u2019t think you could print the stuff I would like to say [about that],\" he said. \"Like my father always taught me, it\u2019s always nice to be nice.
