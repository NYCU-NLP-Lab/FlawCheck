["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on September 22, 2020", "At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that a Pennsylvania court had permitted election officials \u201cto take as long as they want\u201d to count mail-in ballots.", "In fact, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that the ballots mailed by Election Day (or presumed to have been mailed by Election Day)\u00a0could be counted if they arrived by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, three days after Election Day.", "The case focused on the deadline for accepting ballots, not how long the count would take. In fact, the court said in its decision, \u201cWe observe that this extension provides more time for the delivery of ballots while also not requiring alteration of the subsequent canvassing and reporting dates necessary for the Secretary\u2019s final reporting of the election results.\u201d", "Trump, Sept. 19: You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state Supreme Court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means I\u2019ll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah, yeah. We\u2019ll be leading, we\u2019ll be winning Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to win it easy.", "Here\u2019s the background:", "On Oct. 31, 2019, Gov. Tom Wolf\u00a0signed legislation allowing Pennsylvanians for the first time to vote by mail without a specific reason. The law specified that the ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted, regardless of when they were postmarked. (See \u201cVoting by Mail in the Swing States.\u201d)", "In August, expressing concerns that the U.S. Postal Service wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver the ballots on time, the Wolf administration asked the state Supreme Court to extend the time for accepting the ballots by three days as long as they were postmarked by 8 p.m. Nov. 3, Election Day. The administration cited a letter from U.S. Postal Service General Counsel Thomas Moore warning that the state\u2019s deadlines were too tight to guarantee delivery of all the ballots.", "In the state\u2019s June primary, tens of thousands of mail-in ballots arrived after the deadline. Wolf extended the deadline in some counties so that ballots there could be counted.", "Mail-in voting in the general election is expected to be high in Pennsylvania and across the country in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar\u00a0said\u00a0she expects as many as half of the state\u2019s voters to vote by mail in November.", "Republicans opposed extending the deadline.", "On Sept. 17, the state Supreme Court extended the deadline for accepting ballots with the proper postmark until Nov. 6 at 5 p.m. The justices also said that ballots \u201creceived within this period that lack a postmark or other proof of mailing, or for which the postmark or other proof of mailing is illegible, will be presumed to have been mailed by Election Day unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.\u201d", "The opinion pointed out that Pennsylvania would be accepting military and overseas ballots for seven days after the election. (It will finishing counting them Nov. 11.) The court said, \u201cWe conclude that this extension of the received-by deadline protects voters\u2019 rights while being least at variance with Pennsylvania\u2019s permanent election calendar, which we respect and do not alter lightly, even temporarily.\u201d", "Counting the ballots begins at 7 a.m. on Election Day.", "Trump was also wrong when he attributed the decision to \u201csome state Supreme Court justice.\u201d The extension was granted in a 4-3 ruling by the entire court.", "Pennsylvania is an important swing state. Trump narrowly\u00a0won the Keystone State in 2016, and its\u00a020 electoral votes\u00a0were crucial for his victory. It was the first time\u00a0since 1988 that a Republican presidential nominee won the state.", "Thus far in the campaign Democrat Joe Biden is leading in the state, according to the polls. But the race is fairly close. The most recent average of polls from Real Clear Politics shows Biden ahead by four points, 48.7% to 44.7%.", "The state Supreme Court made a couple of other decisions on Sept. 17 also considered helpful to the Democrats. The court ruled that the Green Party hadn\u2019t followed proper procedures and so its presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins, could not appear on the ballot. And it rejected the Trump campaign\u2019s effort to prohibit the use of ballot drop boxes.", "Trump has made his opposition to mail-in voting a major theme in his campaign. About a quarter of ballots cast in the 2018 general election nationwide were by mail, according to the Election Assistance Commission. And mail-in voting soared during this year\u2019s primaries as the nation struggled with the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Trump has complained that because of mail-in voting, results may not be known on election night. \u201cYou won\u2019t know the election result for weeks, months, maybe years after,\u201d he said at the White House on July 31. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll never know the election result, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned with.\u201d", "The president\u00a0has drawn a distinction\u00a0between absentee voting, which he says is \u201cgood,\u201d and mail-in voting. But as\u00a0we have reported, it\u2019s a distinction without a difference. Voting experts have told us verification is the same for both, and many states consider them the same thing.", "As\u00a0we have written, there is no evidence to support the claim that \u201cmailed ballots are corrupt.\u201d\u00a0Voting experts say the president is exaggerating when he says mail ballots are \u201cfraudulent in many cases.\u201d While the instances of voter fraud via mail-in or absentee ballots are more common than in-person voting fraud, the number of known cases is relatively rare.", "That said, mail-in ballots are not without problems. Ballots\u00a0have been rejected\u00a0because they arrive late, because voters forget to sign them or other errors. Because of a massive increase of mail-in voting,\u00a0two congressional races\u00a0in New York City remained undecided nearly six weeks after voters went to the polls.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0Swing State Watch\u00a0is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
