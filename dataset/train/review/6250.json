["About this rating", "On 26 August 2002, conservative pundit Ann Coulter gave an interview to the New York Observer in which she stated \u201cMy only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.\u201d", "Timothy McVeigh was an anti-government extremist and the perpetrator of the 19 April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, an attack that left 168 people -- including 19 children -- dead and injured hundreds more. McVeigh was convicted of the bombing and was executed on 11 June 2001 for his role in committing the single deadliest home-grown terror attack in American history.", "Coulter has never denied she made the remark, which was apparently tape-recorded by Observer writer George Gurley. The relevant passage in Gurley's story that reported it read as follows:", "How about all those very unflattering pictures [the New York Times likes] running of conservatives, I asked. \u201cOh yeah, oh yeah,\u201d Ms. Coulter said. \u201cThey ran not one but two photos of George Herbert Walker Bush throwing up in Japan. Not one, one was not enough! Two photos of that. Is your tape recorder running? Turn it on! I got something to say.\u201d", "Then she said: \u201cMy only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.\u201d", "I told her to be careful.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right, after 9/11 I shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d she said, spotting a cab and grabbing it.", "Coulter addressed the comment during a 29 June 2006 appearance on the Fox News program \"Hannity & Colmes.\"", "During that program, co-host Alan Colmes observed: \"The things you say, the things you write, when you say Tim McVeigh should have bombed the Times building, we should carpet-bomb [Middle Eastern countries] to convert them to Christianity ... I should be laughing at this, these are all jokes.\"", "After some back-and-forth, Coulter, who was apparently upset over a Times report detailing the U.S. government's sifting through Americans' bank records as part of post-9/11, counter-terrorism efforts, responded: \"I think the Timothy McVeigh line was merely prescient after the New York Times has leapt beyond, beyond nonsense straight into treason last week.\"", "Coulter was also asked about the comment in a 28 February 2012 interview by RightWingNews.com and didn't deny making it or express regret over it. Instead, she doubled down:", "John Hawkins:: You\u2019ve caught a lot of heat for a couple of quotes you made. In your column three days after 9/11, you said, \u201cWe know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.\u201d You also said in an interview with the New York Observer, \u201cMy only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.\u201d Do you stand by those quotes or do you think that perhaps you should have phrased them differently?", "Ann Coulter: Ozzy Osbourne has his bats, and I have that darn \u201cconvert them to Christianity\u201d quote. (Thank you for giving the full quote. I have the touch, don\u2019t I?) Some may not like what I said, but I\u2019m still waiting to hear a better suggestion.", "RE: McVeigh quote. Of course I regret it. I should have added, \u201cafter everyone had left the building except the editors and reporters.\u201d", "Coulter so liked her comment that she included it in her 2007 book, If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans:", "McVeigh allegedly served as the inspiration for another would-be domestic terrorist. In August 2017, the FBI arrested 23-year-old Jerry Drake Varnell on suspicion of attempting to detonate what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb (the explosive turned out to be a fake) at a bank building in Oklahoma City. Varnell reportedly harbored an admiration for McVeigh.", "Gurley, George. \u00a0 \"Coultergeist.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Observer. \u00a0 26 August 2002.", "Hawkins, John. \u00a0 \"An Interview With Ann Coulter.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Right Wing News. \u00a0 28 February 2012.", "Coulter, Ann. \u00a0 \"This Is War.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Townhall. \u00a0 14 September 2001.", "Conroy, J Oliver. \u00a0 \"They Hate the US Government, And They're Multiplying: The Terrifying Rise of 'Sovereign Citizens.'\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 15 May 2017.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \"McVeigh's Final Breath.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 11 June 2001.", "ABC News. \u00a0 \"McVeigh's Own Words.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 29 March 2001.", "Barrett, Devlin. \u00a0 \"Man Charged in Anti-Government Bomb Plot in Oklahoma City.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 15 August 2017.", "Keats, Jonathan. \u00a0 \"Jargon Watch: The Rising Danger of Stochastic Terrorism.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Wired. \u00a0 21 January 2019.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
