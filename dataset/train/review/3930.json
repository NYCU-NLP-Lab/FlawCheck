Point three, when green paper seal didn\u2019t match, they didn\u2019t consult us and declared the results of that round. And without getting our signatures, they kept announcing results of other rounds. They will point out and say it\u2019s my signature. But it was taken after announcing the results. I asked them, when should this process have taken place? It should happened prior [to announcing the results], once I\u2019m satisfied only then the results should be announced.
