["The screams and squeals of thrill-seeking amusement park goers have been silent for much of the last year as operators parked their rides during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "A meme circulating on social media would have you believe those reactions would have to remain muted, though, even after California parks welcome back patrons.", "The photo shows a screenshot of a television report that says there would be a \u201cnew \u2018no scream\u2019 policy on roller coasters\u201d that would be enforced at Disneyland. A second altered photo replaces rollercoaster riders with the purse-lipped, temple-throbbing face from another internet meme.", "The industry group that developed guidelines for amusement park reopening in California responded to the claim, pointing out that it never recommended parks ban yelling or screaming on rides.", "A Facebook user who shared the meme did not respond to a request for comment.", "Fact check:Video warning of a pandemic was created in 2020 as satire, not 1956", "On March 5, California\u2019s Department of Public Health released new rules for theme parks and outdoor ballparks and stadiums to reopen effective April 1.", "In a press release, the department said its rules update included \u201csignificantly reduced capacity, mandatory masking and other public health precautions.\u201d Amusement park capacity is determined by the threat level for the county where they are located.", "For example, parks in counties under the state\u2019s most serious threat level must remain closed, while those in counties where COVID-19 cases aren\u2019t spreading as quickly can have up to 35% of their maximum capacity.", "Eleven California counties were at the most serious threat level as of March 22. Another 42, though, were in the next tier as of March 22, which would allow parks in those counties to welcome visitors at about 15% of maximum capacity.", "None of those rules suggest that the state is requiring amusement parks to ban screaming or shouting on rides, as theme parks in Japan did in 2020.", "Confusion about a ban on screaming in parks seemed to stem from guidelines the California Attractions and Parks Association issued.", "The trade organization represents the state\u2019s amusement parks and has board members from some of the state\u2019s biggest attractions, including Disneyland, Six Flags and SeaWorld.", "The group said in a prepared statement published March 18 on Twitter that it issued its own guidelines in September 2020, after California outlined its own plan for reopening businesses.", "In the group\u2019s \u201cResponsible Reopening Plan,\u201d it outlines steps parks can take to meet the criteria the state had laid out, including \u201cability to limit activities that are known to cause increased spread,\u201d such as \"singing, shouting and heavy breathing.\u201d", "Amusement parks can require face coverings and modify seat loading patterns \u201cto mitigate the effects of shouting,\u201d according to the plan, which notes that guests generally face one direction rather than each other.", "\u201cAt no point has CAPA recommended limiting or prohibiting yelling or screaming on amusement park rides as a way to mitigate transmission of COVID-19,\u201d the organization posted on Twitter. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s amusement parks are excited to reopen responsibly under the recently released state guidance for the amusement park industry. These guidelines do not require parks to prohibit screaming.\u201d", "USA TODAY corrected a story about the group's recommendations on March 16.", "The claim that California amusement parks are banning screaming on thrill rides to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is FALSE, based on our research. An industry group\u2019s guidelines for reopening notes that singing, shouting and heavy breathing are known to cause increased spread, but it doesn\u2019t say amusement parks should ban screaming. Its plan notes that face coverings and modified seat patterns on rides are required \u201cto mitigate the effects of shouting.\u201d", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
