["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Former Houston mayor Bill White, running for governor, frequently touts his experience leading the country's fourth-largest city, which he casts as an economic powerhouse.\n\n\"As Houston's mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth,\" White wrote responding to a questionnaire from the League of Women Voters of Texas, a nonpartisan group that encourages active participation in government. The league published White's and other candidates' responses in its primary election Voters Guide for the March 2 party primaries.\n\nHouston led the entire country in job growth? Sounds wondrous. We wondered if White was rightfully bragging.\n\nKaty Bacon, White's spokeswoman, pointed us to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics that White's campaign used to compare the job growth in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown area to growth in the rest of the United States.\n\nYou're reading right: The White campaign compared Houston's job growth to job growth in other states. And it found that over his six years as mayor, Houston gained more jobs than any state outside Texas.\n\nThe skinny: Some 244,100 jobs were added in the Houston area during the period, compared to 156,800 in Washington, the state with the second-highest increase in jobs. Texas was first with 943,000 new jobs.\n\nWe confirmed those numbers \u2014 and found a wrinkle the White campaign overlooked. It turns out that Dallas, which gained 265,800 nonfarm jobs from 2003 through 2009, led the country in job growth.\n\nWhen we noted that that put the Houston area in the number two spot \u2014 in contrast to leading, as White says in the voter guide \u2014 Bacon said: \"Even if we're number two or number three, we're still leading the nation.\"\n\nCheryl Abbot, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, guided us to the way she said most economists gauge job growth \u2014 by the rate at which jobs increase, instead of the gross number of jobs added. By that calculation, Wyoming led the nation with nearly 12 percent job growth during White's mayoral tenure, followed by Houston (about 10.6 percent), Utah (10.2 percent), Dallas and Texas (both about 9.9 percent).\n\nAbbot's approach seemed reasonable. After all, counting raw job gains for any community or state would give areas with more residents a natural advantage in the competition.", "By the same token, relatively few jobs in a place with a small population can have an outsized impact, percentage-wise. Take Odessa, with 21.5 percent job growth, or Grand Junction, Colo., with 14.2 percent.\u00a0\n\nAnother example of the numbers game: Farouk Shami, a Houston businessman and White's opponent in the Democratic primary, has said that the ranks of Houston's unemployed increased by 42,000 people on White's watch. By singling out the raw number, Shami downplays factors including whether employment increased too as population grew, not to mention a devastating recession that affected the entire country.\n\nNo matter how the job numbers are sliced, Houston experienced significant job gains while White was mayor. It added more nonfarm jobs than any other state during that time \u2014 but still, fewer jobs than Dallas. By percentage, Houston boasted the second highest rate of nonfarm job growth (San Antonio was first) among the 10 biggest cities in the country.\n\nHouston was among the national leaders. But it wasn't No. 1.\n\nWe rate White's statement as False.", "League of Women Voters, Voters Guide: 2010 primary election edition, accessed Feb. 16, 2010", "Interviews with Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, Feb. 10 and 17, 2010", "Interview with Ann Hatchitt, communications director at the Texas Workforce Commission, Feb. 15, 2010\n\nInterview with Katy Bacon, spokeswoman, and Tom McCasland, analyst, Bill White's gubernatorial campaign, Feb. 12 and 16, 2010", "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment, Hours and Earnings \u2014 State and Metro areas, accessed Feb. 16, 2010", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Total Nonfarm State Area Employment Hours and Earning, Houston, accessed Feb. 15\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Total Nonfarm State Area Employment Hours and Earning, Dallas, accessed Feb. 15", "Forbes, 10 cities for job growth in 2009, by Tara Weiss, Jan. 5, 2009", "New Geography, All cities rankings \u2014 2009 New Geography best cities for job growth, accessed Feb. 17, 2010", "Bill White for Texas, Memo concerning total jobs added between December 2003 and December 2009, Feb. 8, 2010", "Bill White for Texas, Household survey numbers, Feb. 2, 2010", "Bill White for Texas, Payroll survey numbers, Feb. 2, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
