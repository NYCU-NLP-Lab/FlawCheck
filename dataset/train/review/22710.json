["About this rating", "In February 2016, an old internet conspiracy theory was revived when several media outlets picked up a YouTube video which asserted that\u00a0JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey (a six-year-old beauty pageant star\u00a0who was killed\u00a0in 1996, and whose murder remains unsolved)\u00a0never actually died, and instead grew up to be singer Katy Perry:", "The conspiracy theory is based\u00a0on a variety of observations, but none of the claims are especially convincing. For example, one piece of \"evidence\"\u00a0is that\u00a0Katy Perry and JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey have similar eyebrows.\u00a0Another piece of incidental information cited as evidence is that\u00a0the pop singer once mentioned Ramsey during an interview. The full quote, which can be found in Perry's biography, reads:", "(Katy Perry) would appear on stage at church, at family functions and even for birthday meals in restaurants when she would serenade the table with the latest gospel tune. \"Wherever I went, restaurants or whatever, I would get up and sing 'Amazing Grace,'\" Katy later revealed to the Mail. \"Not that I was one of those stage kids. There was no JonBenet Ramsey inside of me waiting to burst out. I just started.... writing little songs about God or this boy I liked, the two men in my life at the same time.\"", "It's unclear how the above-displayed quote, in which Katy Perry says that she is not JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, proves that she is JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey.", "The creator of the conspiracy video, David Johnson, has produced\u00a0dozens of similar pieces, each offering up \"proof\" that one person is really another. In addition to Katy Perry as\u00a0JonBen\u00e9t, Johnson also claims that Donald Trump is Joe Biden, Jimmy Hendrix is Lionel Ritchie, and Prince Charles is Sir Richard Branson:", "Despite the video, Johnson isn't the first to subscribe to this particular\u00a0theory. The idea was first floated\u00a0on various internet forums after the pop singer shared a \"glamour shot\" of herself as a child in August 2010:", "While most comments more or less\u00a0jokingly pointed out the young Perry's (very slight) resemblance to JonBen\u00e9t, this photo provided the seed for a new conspiracy theory.", "This isn't even the first time that a pop singer has been accused of being an adult\u00a0JonBen\u00e9t. Before Katy Perry, it was\u00a0Lady Gaga, but unlike Katy Perry's conspiracy theory, which centered on the singer's eyebrows, the \"evidence\" for Lady Gaga focused on her ears:", "There are many logical\u00a0flaws with these theories. First, Perry was born in 1984, six years before JonBen\u00e9t (and Lady Gaga, n\u00e9e Stefani Germanotta, was born in 1986). Second, Perry's childhood is well-documented, as is Lady Gaga's:", "Finally, while the tragic case of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey's murder remains unsolved, that doesn't mean that she is still alive. Police\u00a0discovered Ramsey's body in her family's\u00a0basement on 26 December 1996, and an autopsy\u00a0was performed not long afterward.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
