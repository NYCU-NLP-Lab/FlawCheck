You\u2019re either going to pay or you\u2019re going to send people back to work, at the end of the day. And they know a lot more about the situation than we do. They\u2019ve got all the facts and figures and they\u2019re working around the clock. So, to make a decision from my standpoint, I wouldn\u2019t have a clue.

We know very little about it. We\u2019re learning more about it. The previous administration just left us without any kind of medical supplies. President Trump\u2019s had to dig deep.
