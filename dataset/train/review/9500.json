The researchers found that among the studies that met their parameters, the \"secondary attack rates\" \u2014 that is, the likelihood of spread from an infected person to a previously uninfected person within a household \u2014 were higher among people who had symptoms than among those who didn\u2019t: 18% for symptomatic individuals vs. 0.7% for asymptomatic individuals.", "The notion that people with symptoms are more likely to infect others is not a new one. Coughing, for example, is a symptom of COVID-19 and an especially effective way to spread the virus. One meta-analysis study published in September by researchers from Harvard University, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom found that \"asymptomatic patients can transmit\" the virus to others, but that \"such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies.\" Other studies have also shown reduced rates of transmission among asymptomatic individuals.", "In other words, there\u2019s consistent evidence that asymptomatic individuals are less likely to spread the virus than symptomatic individuals are.

A household is a more limited environment that is easier to control and study than a full community.", "The study\u2019s focus on households, rather than on community spread, is relevant because Lahren\u2019s critique largely addresses policies that govern community interactions, such as restrictions on businesses, public gatherings and schools.", "The course of the spread in the United States makes clear that most transmission has been occurring at the community level, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine, health policy and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University.", "\"It is self-evident that here in the U.S. and in other countries, when we have let down our guard, that's been followed by an explosion of COVID transmission that results in people being put into hospitals and ICUs,\" Schaffner said. \"Countries such as Australia and New Zealand that have really instituted these interventions, including masking, social distancing, and controlling the size of groups, have controlled the spread better than any other countries.\"", "In addition, the papers that have addressed community spread suggest that asymptomatic spread does occur.", "Experts added that while one might think that transmission of the virus is more likely to occur in the enclosed spaces of a household, this ignores a key factor: Asymptomatic people will encounter many more people if they\u2019re out and about while infected.", "\"If their viral loads are lower, but their contact rates are higher \u2014 the number of people a person sees in one day \u2014 then the likelihood of transmission could become similar,\" Nichols said.", "Facebook posts said a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by University of Florida researchers has found no asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread of COVID.", "The journal article in question did find lower transmission rates from asymptomatic individuals compared with symptomatic individuals, though the rate was not zero, as the post said.", "The posts ignore that the paper itself warns that the number of studies looking at asymptomatic transmission is small.
