According to McDonald, this helped the CDC to rule out other factors that could have accounted for the decrease.", "The Texas Scorecard article also quotes the following sentence from the CDC study out of context: \"Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1-20 and 21-40 days after restrictions were lifted.\"", "The sentence appears at a point in the study that discusses the effect of indoor dining on coronavirus case and death rates. Although the study found that allowing restaurants to serve customers initially had a statistically insignificant effect on coronavirus case rates, the effect did gradually become statistically significant sometime between the 41st and 60th day after dining restrictions were lifted.", "Other studies on mask mandates from the CDC and other sources have consistently found that widespread mask use decreases coronavirus case rates.", "Texas Scorecard wrote that a CDC study found that \"Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference\" on coronavirus case rates.", "That\u2019s wrong and amounts to a ridiculous reading of a study that actually found the opposite: Mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.", "Pants on Fire!\u00a0\u200b", "CDC, Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates \u2014 United States, March 1\u2013December 31, 2020, Mar. 12, 2021", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Trends in County-Level COVID-19 Incidence in Counties With and Without a Mask Mandate \u2014 Kansas, June 1\u2013August 23, 2020, Nov. 27, 2020", "Texas Scorecard, CDC: Mask mandates made no statistical difference, Mar. 13, 2021", "PNAS, Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19, Jun. 11, 2020", "Science of the Total Environment, Understanding transmission and intervention for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, 2020", "Email interview with Jason McDonald, CDC spokesperson, Mar. 19, 2021", "Email interview with Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions, Mar. 18, 2021", "Email interview with Mary Kathryn Grabowski, an assistant professor in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, Mar. 18, 2021", "Email interview with Nikolas Wada, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, Mar. 19, 2021", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
