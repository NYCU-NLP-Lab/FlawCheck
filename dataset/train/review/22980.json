On a scale of zero to 100, Ryan, who has been in the House since 1999, has a lifetime rating of 90.

TARP", "In October 2008, the Democratically controlled Congress approved a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, primarily to rescue banks in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. It was aimed at rescuing banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America.", "Later, a bailout of the auto industry also was part of TARP, primarily to Chrysler, General Motors and GM\u2019s financial subsidiary, GMAC.", "(The total amount was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank law in 2010.

Those funds were authorized by a law known as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which passed the House more than a year earlier, in August 2007. But Ryan voted against it.", "Before we close, we\u2019ll note there was also a bailout of AIG, the insurance company, in 2008.
