What would be valuable is to reserve such a hospital for the health and security sectors who are working tirelessly in this hour to eradicate corona\u2026. It shouldn\u2019t be given to political thieves known as VIPs. They run to Singapore even for a mild cough and if this devastation had only affected Sri Lanka, would have already fled the country to another to spend time in enjoyment. \u201d", "The post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption reads: \u201cThey must have already been reserved by now...\u201d", "A similar claim\u00a0was\u00a0also made on Facebook here, here, here and here.", "The\u00a0claim is\u00a0misleading; Sri Lankan military officials and the Kotelawala Defence University Hospital director said the hospital will be open to all COVID-19 patients.", "Dr. Seetha Arambepola, a member of the Presidential Task Force appointed to overlook the country\u2019s response to COVID-19, told AFP by telephone on March 30, 2020 that the claim was \u201cinaccurate\u201d.", "She said: \u201cThe KDU hospital has been identified among many other hospitals to be prepared to accommodate patients - particularly patients who require intensive care - if the need arises. However, currently there are only seven patients receiving intensive care treatments and the facilities at the Infectious Diseases Hospital more than suffice. But we believe in being prepared so several other hospital ICUs were also prepped.", "\u201cThere will be absolutely no reservation of facilities exclusively for VIPs - all available resources and facilities will be deployed as and when the need arises without any discrimination.\u201d", "Sri Lanka Army spokesperson Brigadier Chandana Wickramasinghe also told AFP that the military hospital will treat all COVID-19 patients.", "\u201cWe are preparing for every scenario and caring for the patients will be the top priority irrelevant of whether or not they are VIPs,\u201d he said.", "On March 29, 2020, Kotelawala Defence University Hospital\u2019s director Dr. Jayantha Balawardana also addressed the misleading claim\u00a0during a\u00a0news programme on the Sri Lankan television channel ITN, calling it \u201ca blatant lie\u201d.", ">", "From the video\u2019s 10-minute 55-second mark, Balawardana says: \u201cI would like to state in no unclear terms, the claim that KDU is being prepared to accommodate VIP patients is a blatant lie. We prepared six ICU beds at the moment with the assistance of our doctors to be used when necessary. We are prepared to treat patients from anywhere in the country if the need arises.\u201d", "As of April 2, 2020, COVID-19 has killed three\u00a0people and infected 148\u00a0others in Sri Lanka, according to Sri Lanka's state-run Health Promotion Bureau live dashboard.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
