["By Eugene Kiely, D'Angelo Gore and Robert Farley", "Posted on July 12, 2018", "At the NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump made several false statements about the defense spending of the member countries.", "At his press conference after the summit, Trump criticized NATO countries for failing to meet a commitment they made in 2014\u00a0to increase their defense spending to at least 2 percent of each country\u2019s gross domestic product within a decade.", "The countries memorialized that commitment at the Wales summit in September of that year after then-President Obama urged the allies to increase spending to combat Russia\u2019s aggression in the Ukraine and the terrorist group known as ISIS.", "NATO countries did increase defense spending in 2015 and 2016, but Trump falsely claimed that \u201cprior to last year\u201d their defense spending went down \u201cvery substantially.\u201d", "Trump, July 12:\u00a0Prior to last year, where I attended my first meeting, it was going down \u2014 the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially.", "Trump\u2019s first NATO meeting was in May 2017 \u2014 about two-and-a-half years after the commitment NATO countries made in Wales to increase defense spending.", "As shown in the chart below from a July 10 NATO report, NATO Europe and Canada responded by increasing defense spending by 1.83 percent in 2015 and 3.14 percent in 2016 before Trump attended his first meeting.", "In constant 2010 U.S. dollars, NATO Europe and Canada increased their defense spending by $14 billion, or 5 percent, from 2014 to 2016, as the chart below shows.", "Since Trump\u2019s meeting, the other NATO countries have increased their spending even more \u2014 by $26 billion, or 9 percent, from 2016 to 2018, as the NATO chart shows. Trump likes to take credit for the increased spending by NATO countries, but he cannot say that \u201cprior to last year \u2026 the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially.\u201d", "A day earlier at a breakfast meeting, Trump\u00a0wrongly claimed that NATO countries that have not been spending 2 percent of GDP for defense owe the U.S. \u201ca tremendous amount of money.\u201d", "Trump, July 11: And, frankly, many countries [in NATO] owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they\u2019re delinquent, as far as I\u2019m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them. So if you go back 10 or 20 years, you\u2019ll just add it all up. It\u2019s massive amounts of money is owed.", "But Trump is again referring to the amount of money that countries independently decide to spend on their own defense budgets. There is no requirement that countries that spend less than 2 percent of GDP on defense reimburse those countries that do.", "The president\u2019s statement \u201cis not accurate,\u201d Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us in an email.", "\u201cNATO countries do not owe the United States money. And the commitment they made to reach the 2% of GDP threshold was to have done so by 2024,\u201d Preble wrote. \u201cNATO member states fund their own militaries. They don\u2019t pay us to fund ours,\u201d he said.", "In fact, for the majority of the 29 countries in the alliance, the 2 percent of GDP benchmark is just a \u201cguideline,\u201d not a mandate.", "When NATO leaders originally committed in 2006 to try to spend that much on their own defense, a NATO spokesman made it clear that \u201cthis is not a hard commitment that they will do it. \u2026 But it is a commitment to work towards it.\u201d And a 2014 press release about the Wales summit said that countries again agreed to either \u201caim to continue\u201d spending that amount or \u201caim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade.\u201d", "As of 2018, only four members of the alliance \u201chave either national laws or political agreements which call for at least 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,\u201d according to NATO. They are Latvia, Poland, Lithuania and Romania.", "Trump repeatedly claimed that \u201ceveryone has agreed to substantially up their commitment.\u201d But leaders of several European nations later said there were no formal agreements to increase spending beyond previously set goals, and none was provided by NATO.", "Asked during a press conference for details about new commitments agreed to at the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said only that everyone \u201cdeveloped a better common understanding of the challenges, the urgency of spending more\u201d and that allies had promised to \u201credouble their efforts\u201d to increasing defense spending.", "However, Trump left the impression that specific new commitments for funding had been agreed upon.", "\u201cEveryone has agreed to substantially up their commitment,\u201d Trump said in the press conference after the summit. \u201cThey\u2019re going to up it at levels that they\u2019ve never thought of before.\u201d", "Later, Trump said, \u201cEverybody in that room, by the time we left, got along. And they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly.\u201d", "In the past, funding commitments were only an \u201camorphous number\u201d and a \u201cgoal,\u201d but now, he said, they are \u201ca real commitment.\u201d", "Trump, July 12: The commitments are made at a higher level than they\u2019ve ever been made. And the money, it will be paid out faster \u2014 far faster. You know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal. It wasn\u2019t something that they were committed to. Now it\u2019s a commitment. There\u2019s a big difference \u2014 the 2 percent number. And that\u2019s why so many people weren\u2019t reaching it or hitting it. It was just sort of like this amorphous number out there. Now it\u2019s a commitment, a real commitment.", "As we explained, in 2006, NATO members agreed to try to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense spending. And\u00a0in 2014, they agreed again to aim to meet that standard by 2024.", "After the summit, several NATO leaders said no new commitments had been made that would alter those agreements.", "\u201cI made clear that we know that we have to do more and that we have been doing so for quite a while,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \u201cThat turning point has long been initiated. \u2026 The American president has demanded, what has been discussed for months, that the burden-sharing has to change. And we made clear, well, I made clear for myself and others also made it clear, that we are on this path, which is in our own interest and can make us overall stronger.\u201d", "\u201cIt confirms the goal of 2 percent by 2024. That\u2019s all,\u201d said French President Emmanuel Macron.", "\u201cEveryone agreed to raise spending as they agreed in 2014, and everyone agreed to respect the commitments they made,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe reaffirmed a credible budget strategy that meets our needs.\u201d", "And, Bloomberg reported, \u201cItaly has no plans to change its defense spending plans as a result of the summit, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters. Italy has focused more on targets other than the 2 percent goal, such as increasing its participation in NATO missions. \u2018It isn\u2019t just an accounting issue,\u2019 Conte said.\u201d", "According to NATO figures, Germany, France and Italy spend 1.24 percent, 1.81 percent and 1.15 percent of their annual GDP on defense, respectively.", "In a press conference after the summit, a reporter for the Washington Post asked Stoltenberg for details on any new commitments agreed to in the meetings.", "Stoltenberg replied generally that everyone \u201cdeveloped a better common understanding of the challenges, the urgency of spending more, and allies committed to spending and to investing in our shared security.\u201d", "A reporter from the Financial Times tried again, asking, \u201cOn the substance, can you confirm then that nothing was agreed this morning either formally or informally that commits member states to going beyond the Wales 2 percent target or indeed any other commitments?\u201d", "Stoltenberg similarly replied: \u201cWe have made conclusions at this summit which confirms our support for NATO, the importance of investing more and all our allies agreed that we need to deliver on our commitments. There is a new sense of urgency. And all allies agreed to redouble their efforts.\u201d", "While the\u00a0Summit Declaration\u00a0issued after this year\u2019s meeting continued to refer to the goal that 2 percent of GDP be spent on defense by 2024, Stoltenberg did highlight one small change. \u201cInitiated by President Trump, last year, we agreed to develop national plans,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cWe have clearly stated this year that we need\u00a0credible\u00a0national plans, and I expect all allies to follow up on their national plans. And the national plans are a very valuable tool to make sure that we deliver, and that we increase defense spending substantially.\u201d", "Trump repeated several other inaccurate claims that we have written about before.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
