["The posts, for example this one published to Facebook April 13, 2019, and shared more than 300 times since, contain a purported screenshot of\u00a0a report from\u00a0national news site Inquirer.net about the politician Samira Gutoc.", "Gutoc is running for the upper house of the Philippine Congress in May 13 elections. Here is the candidate list\u00a0on the government website, in which Gutoc is\u00a0number 36, and here is a campaign video featuring her and other opposition candidates.", "The image in the false post features a photo of Gutoc and a headline that says: \u201cGutoc to netizens: I\u2019ll send you to jail for making fun of wearing my life vest!\u201d", "The same image has been shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here.", "Below is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:", "On April 8, 2019, Gutoc and other opposition candidates tried to sail to Scarborough Shoal, a disputed territory\u00a0in the South China Sea which has been under Chinese control since 2012.", "Here is an information page on the Scarborough Shoal\u00a0on the website of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, here is a Facebook post by the group of politicians about their attempt and here is a Manila Bulletin report\u00a0about the stunt.", "Photos posted online of the trip for example here\u00a0on Twitter showed Gutoc wearing a life jacket backwards. Some social media users mocked her for this.", "For example, the caption of\u00a0this Facebook post, translated to English, says: \u201cBecause Samira Gutoc is so brave, she will charge towards China even if her life vest is worn backwards. GIVE HER A JACKET!\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of that post, which is dated April 12, 2019:", "Gutoc defended herself on April 12 in the Facebook post embedded below.", "Translated to English, its caption says: \u201cI may have worn my life vest the wrong way, but my stance is not wrong. What is hard is when you\u2019re wearing it the right way, but you have already sold your soul, heart and mind to China\u201d.", "Her comments were\u00a0reported by\u00a0news organisations\u00a0including in\u00a0this article published on Inquirer.net, also on April 12.", "The headline of the Inquirer.net article says: \u201cGutoc slams critics: Wearing life vest wrong better than having wrong principles\u201d", "Here is a comparison image showing the misleading post on the left and the genuine article from Inquirer.net on the right:", "The two screenshots\u00a0have key similarities, including the Inquirer logo and the reporter\u2019s byline.", "However the genuine article is timestamped April 12 at 2:08 pm \u2013 before the date of April 13\u00a0given in both\u00a0the misleading image\u00a0and the Facebook post\u00a0that shared it.", "There is no indication\u00a0in the original Inquirer.net article that it was updated at a later date.", "Inquirer.net said the misleading post \u201cis not real\u201d.", "\u201cAn article allegedly published by Inquirer.net, under the byline of reporter Gabriel Pabico Lalu, which claims senatorial candidate Samira Gutoc has threatened to jail her critics is not real,\u201d the site said in a statement\u00a0here.", "In a statement on Facebook, embedded below,\u00a0Gutoc also denied having said the quote in the misleading post's headline:", "Her post, when translated to English, says: \u201cFAKE NEWS ALERT!!!
