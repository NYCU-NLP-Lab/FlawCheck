They have unscientific fears about nuclear power and GMO foods.

Bush.\u00a0Lowry said what he had in mind was a 2007 book by Naomi Wolf called The End of America: Letter of warning to a young patriot.", "Wolf, a feminist and activist, cast the book as a dire warning about the trajectory of the country. In it, Wolf lists 10 changes that she said typically mark a country\u2019s descent into totalitarianism.

A military brigade -- that's 3/4,000 soldiers -- has been brought in to police our streets.\"", "Wolf goes on to say that \"the president now has an army.\"", "\"The coup is here rather than looming,\" said Wolf, who went on to tell listeners she would be posting instructions on how to arrest the president on a website.", "Our ruling", "Lowry said that a leading liberal had written a book about how Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of this country.", "The book Lowry cited does not allege a specific plot.
