["Teachers in Apex, North Carolina protest for higher pay in 2014", "In a speech in Raleigh on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton laid out her plan for improving the economy and reducing income inequality.", "But she segued into local politics, too, seeking to boost the campaigns of North Carolina Democrats like Roy Cooper, who is running for governor against Republican incumbent Pat McCrory.", "Teacher pay was her weapon of choice for hitting the state\u2019s Republican leaders. Clinton was introduced at her rally by a Durham teacher and by former Gov. Jim Hunt, a Democrat known for his education initiatives.", "\"You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education,\" Clinton said. \"Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family.\"", "There are two things here that made our ears perk up. Can the average teacher \"barely support a family\" on his or her salary? And if not, is it the fault of McCrory and the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature?", "How much teachers make", "The average North Carolina public school teacher made $47,819 in 2014-15 according to the National Education Association, an advocacy group. Both the NEA and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction have estimated the average teacher this school year is making just shy of $48,000.", "That\u2019s the equivalent of slightly more than $23 per hour when adjusted to 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.", "That\u2019s not the schedule teachers work, but we\u2019ll use it for the sake of comparison since it\u2019s what most people are familiar with.", "North Carolina\u2019s cost of living", "What does it mean to be barely able to support a family? Clinton\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond on the record, but there are a few ways of looking at it.", "The average teacher\u2019s salary is more than triple the minimum wage. It\u2019s also enough to keep a family of nine out of poverty. For a more traditional family of four, it\u2019s about double the poverty level.", "But the government\u2019s poverty guidelines have faced criticism for being outdated and/or inaccurate. So what about other ways of measuring ways to support a family?", "MIT professor Amy Glasmeier created something called the Living Wage Calculator. It takes local-level data on taxes, rent, transportation, food, child care and other costs into account. The formula also assumes non-working adults are providing full-time child care.", "Glasmeier has written that it shows \"the minimum level of income required for individuals and families to pay for basic living expenses\" \u2013 a pretty good approximation of what Clinton was talking about.", "A single parent making the average teacher\u2019s salary could support one child but would struggle to support two children, according to the living wage calculations.", "Likewise, if the teacher is married with a child, an average salary could easily support the child and a stay-at-home spouse.", "The salary would still be considered a living wage even if that couple had a second child \u2013 here it gets to the level of barely enough \u2013 but not if they had a third child and the spouse remained unemployed.", "But we didn\u2019t want to just take a calculator\u2019s word for it. So we asked a professor who studies poverty and politics, Duke University\u2019s Anirudh Krishna. He agreed that a teacher\u2019s salary can provide for a family\u2019s basic needs but not much more.", "\"An annual salary of $48,000 is less than what typically makes for significant intergenerational upward mobility,\" Krishna said. \"Rents or mortgages usually make up for half of that amount, and food and fuel account for much of the rest, leaving relatively little for a rainy day, far less for a child\u2019s college education.\"", "So this part of Clinton\u2019s claim could be accurate or not, depending on how big the family in question is and what you consider to be barely supporting that family \u2013 whether it\u2019s simply keeping the children out of poverty or being able to do more.", "But is Clinton right to pin the blame on Republicans for not giving teachers even higher salaries?", "Political blame", "Since 2010, the average teacher has earned right around the state\u2019s median household income. Republicans took control of the state legislature in January 2011.", "In most states, teachers make more. North Carolina is one of the 10 lowest-paying states for teachers, and inflation-adjusted salaries have dropped 10.2 percent in the last decade, according to the NEA. Only three states saw teachers\u2019 salaries fall by more between 2004-05 and 2014-15.", "Who is responsible? Both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their watch in the last decade, although Democrats were in power most of that time.", "Under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley average teacher pay grew by thousands of dollars, to $48,454 in 2008-09, his last year in office.", "Then the Great Recession happened and in 2009-10, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue ordered a pay cut for state employees and teachers. That cut was approved by a Democrat-led legislature, and average teacher pay continued to fall every year under Perdue.", "Republicans were in charge of the statehouse the last two years of Perdue\u2019s term. Both years, Perdue vetoed the budget and said more money should\u2019ve been spent on education, but to no avail.", "Average teacher pay continued dropping after she left office. It reached its lowest point in McCrory\u2019s first budget \u2013 the third year of GOP legislative control \u2013 when it dipped below $45,000 to 47th in the nation in 2013-14.", "But since then, teacher pay has been rising. It\u2019s still not yet back to pre-recession levels, but it could be next year. The House, Senate and McCrory\u2019s office have all said teachers ought to earn more than $50,000 on average in 2016-17.", "Our ruling", "Clinton said the average North Carolina teacher\u2019s salary \"can barely support a family\" and placed the blame squarely on Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican legislators.", "The average teacher salary of just less than $48,000 is higher than what most households around the state make per year. Yet it\u2019s also right around what\u2019s considered the bare minimum \"living wage\" for a couple with two kids.", "Clinton, however, muddles the political blame. Average teacher pay did hit its lowest point when Republicans controlled both the governor\u2019s office and General Assembly. Yet the only actual salary cuts happened under Democratic control. And more recently, Republicans have raised teacher pay almost back to pre-recession levels.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af0c5cf5-08de-414b-8ccd-705444c458a8", "Time Magazine, transcript of Clinton speech in Raleigh", "Email interview with Anirudh Krishna, Duke University\u2019s Edgar T.
