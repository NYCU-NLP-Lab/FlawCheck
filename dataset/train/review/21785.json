Yes, it\u2019s the universal background checks. Yes, we should stop selling weapons of war into our communities,\" said O\u2019Rourke, who was born and raised in El Paso. \"But I think we also have to confront this hatred that I have never seen in my lifetime, and we certainly have not seen in El Paso. Some years, in a city of almost 700,000, we had five murders the entire year. Our average over the last 10 years is 18 (murders per year). We exceeded that average just on one day. This is not normal, it is not acceptable.
