Many people in the angry camp apparently did not view the rest of @randygdub's tweets, which are inconsistent and apparently published solely to cause controversy:", "i am a Black man for trump. that's right libs, we do exist pic.twitter.com/TXx9lX7kM4 \u2014 raandy (@randygdub) October 12, 2016", "eat shit stupid baby pic.twitter.com/iD2xvOgtG8", "\u2014 raandy (@randygdub) October 4, 2016", "The user posted no proof of employment with USPS or any organization, nor was his story particularly plausible:", "@CassandraRules That person is part of \"Weird Twitter.\" They're lying and don't actually work at a post office. \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 17, 2016", "We contacted the Franklin County Board of Elections and the Ohio Secretary of State's Elections division and asked about the mailing format of Ohio's absentee ballots. They told us that Ohio's absentee ballots are enclosed in not one but two secrecy envelopes, making it impossible for postal workers to identify \"Trump votes\" without opening envelopes:", "Nevertheless, @USPSHelp was deluged with complaints. A\u00a0representative confirmed that the Postal Service investigated and determined that \"Raandy\" was most likely not an employee:", "The Postal Service has completed an initial investigation of the mentioned tweets and does not believe these tweets were made by a postal employee. However, the Postal Service will continue to monitor this situation and if it is determined that the individual making the tweets is a postal employee and there is substantiated evidence of mail being tampered with or destroyed , then the Postal Service will take appropriate corrective action to address the situation.
