Without directly mentioning former President Donald Trump\u2019s habit of calling the coronavirus the \u201cChina virus\u201d because of its reported country of origin, Biden said the federal government had directly contributed to this growing xenophobia.", "Online, many argued that Biden\u2019s order was banning all references to the \u201cChina virus\u201d:", "This is a misrepresentation of the executive order. While the language in the order does not explicitly reference the \u201cChina virus,\u201d it does talk about how the federal government has \u201cplayed a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments [against the AAPI community] through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin.\u201d", "The memorandum issued by the White House directs federal agencies to do the following:", "Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that official actions, documents, and statements, including those that pertain to the COVID-19 pandemic, do not exhibit or contribute to racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

He can only direct federal agencies to not use such terms in their official materials and statements. The order does not explicitly reference \u201cChina virus,\u201d but it does condemn the use of such phrases that refer to the coronavirus through its location of origin because they contribute to xenophobia against the AAPI community.", "As such we rate this claim a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
