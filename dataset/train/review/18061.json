["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on June 9, 2020", "Instagram posts erroneously claim the \u201cSAME DOCTOR\u201d performed the autopsies on \u201cJFK, MLK, Epstein, AND George Floyd.\u201d The doctor referenced, pathologist Michael Baden, has connections to those four cases \u2014 but he only performed an autopsy on Floyd, as a secondary examination for Floyd\u2019s family.", "Dr. Michael Baden is a well-known forensic pathologist whose name has appeared in connection with many high-profile cases. Most recently, he performed an independent autopsy on George Floyd on behalf of Floyd\u2019s family.", "But tweets and Instagram accounts peddling conspiracy theories are misrepresenting his role in three previous cases, falsely claiming that Baden conducted the autopsies on President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Jeffrey Epstein.", "\u201cSAME DOCTOR!\u201d reads a screenshot of a tweet shared in an Instagram post. \u201cThe autopsies of JFK, MLK, Epstein, AND George Floyd were all performed by Dr. Michael Baden.\u201d A similar post from an account pushing the QAnon conspiracy theory shared the false claim with a caption that said, \u201cWhen you want to push a narrative \u2013 it\u2019s important to have consistent actors.\u201d", "Baden does have connections to all four of the cases mentioned, as we\u2019ll explain, but he only conducted an autopsy on Floyd, which followed an official autopsy conducted by the medical examiner\u2019s office of Hennepin County, Minnesota.", "Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed May 25 during an arrest in Minneapolis. Four former police officers have now been\u00a0charged in the case, including Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes and has been charged with second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.", "The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office performed its autopsy the next day, May 26.", "Baden and another pathologist, Dr. Allecia Wilson, were hired by Floyd\u2019s family to conduct an independent autopsy \u2014 which they performed\u00a0on May 31.", "While both examinations described a homicide as a result of police restraint, the specific findings varied.", "On June 1, the team representing Floyd\u2019s family announced the preliminary findings from the independent autopsy, which found that Floyd died of \u201casphyxia due to neck and back pressure.\u201d The pathologists determined that the pressure \u201cinterfered with his breathing and blood flow to the brain\u201d and that Floyd \u201cdied at the scene.\u201d", "The same day, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in a press release said the cause of death was \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d \u2014 meaning his heart stopped. It also made note of \u201cother significant conditions,\u201d including \u201c[a]rteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; recent methamphetamine use.\u201d", "As for Baden\u2019s role in the Kennedy, King and Epstein cases, the social media posts distort the facts.", "Baden was the chairman of the Forensic Pathology Panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. That committee in the late 1970s re-investigated the deaths of Kennedy, who was killed in 1963, and of King, who was killed in 1968.", "But the actual autopsy on Kennedy was conducted by two Navy pathologists \u2014 Cmdr. James J. Humes and Cmdr. J. Thornton Boswell \u2014 as well as a U.S. Army physician, Lt. Col. Pierre A. Finck.", "The autopsy on King was performed by Dr. Jerry T. Francisco, who was the medical examiner for Shelby County, Tennessee.", "In the case of Epstein, the financier and sex offender who died in prison in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges, his autopsy was done by the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner. The office concluded Epstein committed suicide by hanging himself.", "In an August 2019 statement provided to FactCheck.org and other outlets, Dr. Barbara Sampson, the city\u2019s chief medical examiner,\u00a0said \u201c[a]t the request of those representing the decedent, and with the awareness of the federal prosecutor, I allowed a private pathologist (Dr. Michael Baden) to observe the autopsy examination. This is routine practice.\u201d", "Baden said in an interview that he was hired by Epstein\u2019s brother to observe the official autopsy. Baden publicly disagreed with the official finding that Epstein died by suicide, saying that fractures in Epstein\u2019s neck were suggestive of a homicide. Baden later told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d: \u201cI hesitate, as usual, to make a final opinion until all the evidence is in.\u201d", "Sampson\u2019s office has said it stands by its determination.", "So it\u2019s false to say that the \u201cSAME DOCTOR,\u201d Baden, conducted the \u201cautopsies of JFK, MLK, Epstein, AND George Floyd.\u201d While Baden played a role in re-examining two of those cases, and observed the autopsy in another, he only actually performed an autopsy on Floyd \u2014 days after one was conducted by a county medical examiner\u2019s office.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
