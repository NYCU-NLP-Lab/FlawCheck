Some will see an increase, perhaps because of changes in the bill that scale back the mortgage-interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction.", "The committee\u2019s analysis projects that, between 2019 and 2022, the Republican tax bill would cut taxes for each of the 11 income ranges into which it breaks down taxpayers.", "On the smaller end, those earning less than $10,000 would see a cumulative tax decrease of $557 million for 2019.

The figures just mean that, when all the individual cuts and increases are added up, they cumulatively produce a decrease. However, some percentage of individuals in each income group may face higher taxes right away.", "\"Taxes go down on average for each income group in 2019, but that doesn\u2019t mean that taxes go down for every single household,\" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.", "One backer of the tax bill, Grover Norquist, explained this phenomenon more accurately when he wrote a column in the Washington Examiner.
