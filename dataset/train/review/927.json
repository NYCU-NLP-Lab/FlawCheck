(AP)", "When Carlos Gimenez took office as Miami-Dade mayor in 2011, he slashed the mayor\u2019s salary from $230,000 to $150,000. Seven years later, the county commission agreed to raise his pay to $250,000 at his request.", "While Gimenez was a county commissioner about a decade ago, he had a car allowance for a Mercedes-Benz. When he became mayor he took over the lease personally.", "An attack by U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell portrays Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez as living the high life at county hall at taxpayers\u2019 expense.", "\"Corrupt Carlos Gimenez approved a 67% pay raise for himself and increased his own pension,\" states Mucarsel-Powell\u2019s website. \"He makes $250,000 a year, more than almost every big-city Mayor in the country. He also kept his taxpayer-funded Mercedes-Benz after slashing $400 million in government jobs and spending.\"", "Mucarsel-Powell, a first-term incumbent, faces a challenge from Gimenez, a Republican who has served as mayor of Florida\u2019s most populous county since 2011. It\u2019s one of 18 pivotal House and Senate races up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking, and the most competitive congressional contest in Florida.", "Evidence cited by Murcarsel-Powell\u2019s campaign website \u2014 including news articles and county documents \u2014 show that Gimenez did raise his pay and accept a car perk, but these claims leave out significant context.

It\u2019s worth noting that if Gimenez wins the congressional race, his Washington salary will drop to the $174,000 paid to members of Congress.", "In short, yes.", "County records showed Gimenez was paid about $251,000 in 2019.

He makes $250,000 a year, more than almost every big-city Mayor in the country. He also kept his taxpayer-funded Mercedes-Benz after slashing $400 million in government jobs and spending.\"", "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
