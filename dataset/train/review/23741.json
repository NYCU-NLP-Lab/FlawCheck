We found that Phillips is not connected to Ellison\u2019s case, and the allegation against him is based on a decades-old lawsuit filed against an organization where he was once a board member.", "The ad makes the suggestion that Phillips has been \"sued over and over\" and was \"charged\" with ignoring sexual harassment at his companies. We found no evidence that supports either claim.", "To be clear: Phillips is not involved in the domestic abuse allegations levied against Ellison by a former girlfriend, nor is Phillips involved in any sexual harassment case.", "The Paulsen campaign points to\u00a0a February 2007 Star Tribune article that discusses a lawsuit brought against Allina Health by seven nurses who said they were sexually harassed by a doctor at one of the health group\u2019s clinics.
