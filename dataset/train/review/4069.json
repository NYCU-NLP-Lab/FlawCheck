The photograph was accompanied by a piece of text that labeled Democrats hypocrites, arguing that while they have urged Americans to wear masks to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, they have failed to do so themselves:", "However, this photograph was not taken during Lewis' funeral on July 30, 2020, but was taken in 2015. Masks were not commonplace (or necessary) in the United States in 2015, which predated the COVID-19 pandemic by about five years.", "This photograph was taken in September 2015 at the funeral of Helen Burns Jackson, the mother of Rev. Jesse Jackson, at the Springfield Baptist Church in Greenville, South Carolina. This photographer was Heidi Heilbrunn of the Greenville News, and the picture is available with the following caption:", "President Bill Clinton, left, sits next to Rev.

For example, here's a photograph (by Alyssa Pointer-Pool from Getty Images) that was truly taken at Lewis' funeral:", "While speakers at the funeral removed masks to deliver their remarks, they typically put the masks back on shortly after they stepped away from the podium. Former U.S. President Barack Obama, for instance, wore a mask as he approached the podium, removed his face covering to deliver his eulogy, and then put his mask on when he finished his remarks. The following video includes various crowd shots. As far as we can tell, just about everyone wore a mask:", "McPherson, Lindsey. \u00a0 \"John Lewis\u2019 Best Friends in Congress Attend His Funeral.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Roll Call. \u00a0 30 July 2020.", "Greenville News. \u00a0 \"Clinton Attends Jackson Funeral.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 September 2015.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
