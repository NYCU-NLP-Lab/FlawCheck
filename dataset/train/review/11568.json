["About this rating", "Panasonic Japan is producing a limited number of companion robots called Nicobo. And yes, they fart.", "Although the robot has a tail, it's a bit of a stretch to refer to it as a cat.", "It's unknown whether Panasonic will produce more robots for the general public to purchase.", "In mid-February 2021, Panasonic Japan released a video of a little round robot created for the sole purpose of human companionship.
