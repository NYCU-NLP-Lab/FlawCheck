We wanted to find out.", "It\u2019s accurate that during the 16th century (and beyond) people had very strong opinions about makeup and its ability to deceive the eye.

The story says:", "\"Called the Hoops and Heels Act, it stated that any woman who tried to \u2018seduce and betray into matrimony\u2019 a man using \u2018scents, paints, cosmetic washes, artificial teeth, false hair, Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled shoes, [or] bolstered hips\u2019 would be tried for witchcraft and have her marriage voided if found guilty.", "\"Except it never happened.
