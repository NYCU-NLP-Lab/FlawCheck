["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on November 9, 2018", "After Democrats gained control of the House in the midterm elections, President Donald Trump repeated his long-running statement that he wouldn\u2019t release his tax returns because they were under audit, making false claims in the process:", "During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump refused to release his tax returns, bucking a decades-long tradition. Every major party candidate for president since 1980 has released tax returns during the campaign. Even in the 1976 campaign, Jimmy Carter publicly released tax returns, while Gerald Ford revealed\u00a0a summary\u00a0of his returns.", "\u201cEvery other major party nominee since then has released complete tax returns: not just summaries, not just a Form 1040, but the whole thing,\u201d Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax Analysts\u2019\u00a0Tax History Project, told us when we wrote about this issue in 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s been standard practice and that\u2019s what voters have come to expect.\u201d", "Some candidates have released returns for considerably more years than others: Republicans Mitt Romney and John McCain released two years of returns, while other nominees have released at least five. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released returns for eight years.", "But Trump has released none, even after he was inaugurated.", "Now that Democrats have won control of the House in the midterm elections, they could use subpoena power to demand the president\u2019s tax returns. Trump was asked in a press conference the day after the midterms whether he would release those coveted returns.", "Trump, Nov. 7:\u00a0Well, look, as I have told you, they\u2019re under audit. They have been for a long time. They\u2019re extremely complex. People wouldn\u2019t understand them. \u2026", "Now, I did do a filing of over 100 pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the \u2014 you know, the detail. You\u2019d get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.", "But when you\u2019re under audit \u2014 and I\u2019m on under very continuous audit because there are so many companies, and it is a very big company. \u2026\u00a0But I don\u2019t want to do it during the audit. And, really, no lawyer \u2014 even from the other side, they say often \u2014 not always \u2014 but when you\u2019re under audit, you don\u2019t have \u2014 you don\u2019t subject it to that. You get it done, and then you release it.\u00a0So when that happens, if that happens, I would certainly have an open mind to it. \u2026", "Nobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit, okay?", "The president claimed that \u201cyou get far more\u201d from his legally required financial disclosure forms \u201cthan you could ever get from a tax return.\u201d But much of the information one could get from a tax return isn\u2019t in a financial disclosure form, which is designed to reveal financial interests.", "We checked in with Thorndike, at Tax Analysts, again on this point. The question, he said, is \u201cmore of what?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a statement of net worth or asset value on a tax return,\u201d he said. The financial disclosure form does a much better job of telling you how rich someone is.", "But the disclosure form has \u201cno information about the president\u2019s tax behavior,\u201d Thorndike said. The tax returns tell us if and how the president complies with tax laws. With the financial disclosure form, \u201cyou\u2019re not getting any sense of how he structured his businesses to minimize his taxes.\u201d", "Trump has filed financial disclosure forms, as the law requires of senior government officials; his form for 2017 was 92 pages long. The form asks for positions held outside the government, employment assets and income, and other assets and liabilities, often expressed as a range of value.", "It wouldn\u2019t reveal Trump\u2019s effective tax rate, charitable donations or other deductions he takes, exactly the kind of information experts cited when Trump claimed during the campaign that\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s nothing to learn\u201d from his returns. A return would give exact figures for income and business losses, and what taxes were paid, and it could expose conflicts of interest.", "And, as we said during the debate on the Republican tax legislation, Trump\u2019s tax returns would show how the tax policies the president supports would affect him personally. Trump claimed in November 2017, a month before he signed that tax legislation into law, that\u00a0the Republican tax plan would \u201ccost me a fortune.\u201d He has offered no proof, and we found the claim was highly unlikely.", "The president stood to potentially benefit from a change in the estate tax and pass-through taxes, and the repeal of the alternative minimum tax. His tax returns would show exactly how he did or didn\u2019t benefit from the tax law.", "In the Nov. 7 press conference, Trump also wrongly claimed, \u201cNobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit, okay?\u201d In fact, Richard Nixon did so when he was president.", "In 1973 and early 1974, Nixon was embroiled in a tax scandal, sparked by an IRS leak that questioned a charitable deduction of $500,000 for giving his vice presidential papers to the National Archives. Thorndike wrote a detailed paper on the issue for the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.", "In the midst of that scandal, the IRS reopened an audit of Nixon\u2019s returns. On\u00a0Dec. 7, the IRS delivered letters to the White House notifying the president of the audit, and the very next day, the White House released tax returns for years 1968 to 1972, according to Thorndike\u2019s paper.", "The White House had also previously told Congress that Nixon was going to ask the Joint Committee on Taxation to review his tax returns. So, Nixon was both under audit from the IRS and essentially requesting an audit by the JCT when he released his returns.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that most presidents since the 1970s have released their tax returns publicly despite the fact that presidents and vice presidents are automatically subject to annual IRS audits, according to the Internal Revenue Manual.", "Thorndike told us that most have released the returns on or near\u00a0tax day \u2014 April 15 \u2014 knowing full well that the return would be subject to an audit.", "Then-President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, for instance, released their 2015 returns on April 15, 2016. They released their 2014 and 2013 returns a few days before the tax filing days.", "For Trump, we do have the first two pages of his 2005 return, which were leaked and then released by MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow in March 2017. Those summary pages show Trump paid $38 million in federal income taxes on $150 million of reported income. But the full return would show more information, including deductions and how the president\u2019s businesses are structured for tax purposes.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
