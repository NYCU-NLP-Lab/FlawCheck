This video was not deceptively edited, nor was the audio manufactured. However, this video does not capture a narrative-destroying, hot-mic moment. Rather, it shows an informal conversation between two friends and some gallows humor.", "The video was widely shared on social media as if it showed members of the news media \"admitting\" that COVID-19 pandemic was a hoax. Others highlighted a comment from Mills in which he says that \"we\u2019ve all been vaccinated.\" These social media users did not, however, question how these two claims \u2014 the disease is a hoax and that everyone has been vaccinated for the disease \u2014 could even co-exist. How would you vaccinate against a disease that isn't real?", "Roberts told the Associated Press that the exchange captured in this video showed some \"sardonic gallows humor\" between friends, that the conversation was a \"total joke,\" and that \"clearly no one has been vaccinated\" because no COVID-19 vaccine yet exists.", "The conversation in the above-displayed video largely deals with a recent study from the University of Southern California that found the infection rate in the state was likely much higher than originally reported. While this study suggests that more people may be carrying the virus, it also may mean that the fatality rate could be much lower.", "Roberts asked the White House's Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx about this study during the press conference:", "In sum, the viral video truly shows an informal exchange between Roberts and Mills in which Mills joked that COVID-19 was a hoax. While this video was shared as if it featured a \"bombshell\" revelation, it really just showed an off-the-cuff exchange between two friends.", "In fact, at the end of this viral video, after Roberts has told his friend Mills about the new study, Mills jokes that \"it was a hoax,\" to which Roberts responds: \"No, I don't think it was a hoax.\"", "Lajka, Arijeta. \u00a0 \"Video Misrepresents Journalists\u2019 Comments in White House Briefing Room.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a0 21 April 2020.", "Hartung, Kaylee; Mendelsohn, Michael; Furhman, Matthew; Francis, Enjoli. \u00a0 \"Antibody Test Study Results Suggest COVID-19 Cases Likely Much Higher Than Reported.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News. \u00a0 20 April 2020.", "Hartung, Kaylee; Mendelsohn, Michael; Furhman, Matthew; Francis, Enjoli. \u00a0 \"Antibody Test Study Results Suggest COVID-19 Cases Likely Much Higher Than Reported.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News. \u00a0 20 April 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
