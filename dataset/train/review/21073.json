["The United States Secretary of Defence General (Retd.) Lloyd J. Austin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his three-day visit to India. This was the first outreach by the US administration since Joe Biden was elected President less than two months ago. NDTV\u2019s report that the US Defence Secretary said that he discussed human rights issue with Indian ministers is receiving substantial backlash on social media. One Avinash Srivastava juxtaposed NDTV\u2019s report with an ANI tweet where \u2018sources\u2019 in India state the opposite.", "#NDTV means \u201cLies\u201d, \u201cFake News\u201d, & \u201cPropaganda\u201d. #ShutDownNDTV pic.twitter.com/WUEVGX91IG", "\u2014 Avinash Srivastava (@go4avinash) March 21, 2021", "Another user Atul Ahuja termed NDTV \u2018Pakistan media house\u2019 while claiming that the outlet falsely reported that Austin had a discussion on human rights issue with Indian ministers when ANI says that he did not.
