["Across the images, the meme text reads: \u201cI\u2019m not judging...I\u2019m just showing you pictures of Jacob Blake.\u201d", "More examples of the post are available on Facebook here, here and here and on Twitter here and here.", "Video footage shows a white police officer shooting Blake at close range while Blake tried to get into a car on August 23 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.", "Blake, 29, was left likely paralyzed from the waist down.", "Coming three months after the death of\u00a0George Floyd, the incident involving Blake was the latest US police shooting of a black man and sparked unrest in Kenosha. Campaigning for November\u2019s election, President Donald Trump condemned \u201canti-police rhetoric\u201d and dismissed anti-racism protests as \u201cdomestic terror\u201d during a visit to the traumatized city. His Democratic challenger Joe Biden also visited Kenosha and met with Blake\u2019s father.", "Photos of Blake circulated widely after he was shot, and he does not closely resemble the boy in the photo collage.", "AFP Fact Check reverse image searched the collage of photos, which yielded an August 2, 2020 tweet with the image collage but without the text overlay about Blake. The caption identifies the person pictured as \u201cthe young man shot by police a few weeks ago in Chicago,\u201d not Kenosha, where Blake was shot.", "Searching the bottom right image of the collage with the term \u201cChicago\u201d yields a blog post dated April 13, 2016 containing two images in the posts. The blog says the pictures show Pierre Loury, a 16-year-old boy who was fatally shot by Chicago police on April 11, 2016.", "Searching for the uncaptioned collage with results limited from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the year Loury was killed, shows it was shared as early as April 15, 2016. This was four years before Blake was shot and five days after what police called an \u201carmed confrontation\u201d with Loury.", "Images from news coverage of a memorial for Loury show that he resembled\u00a0the boy pictured in the collage, while Blake does not.", "However, Andrew Stroth, Loury\u2019s family lawyer, told AFP that he \u201ccannot confirm the identity\u201d after reviewing the photos.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
