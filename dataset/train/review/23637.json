["About this rating", "Four black people have been charged with breaking into the house of an elderly white woman and killing her.", "The intent of the break-in was apparently robbery rather than murder, there's no indication the killing was racially motivated, and news reports did not confirm the attackers were part of a \"gang.\"", "On 1 September 2016, the conservative click bait web site US Herald shared a story that claimed a grisly murder of an elderly white woman in Georgia was a racially motivated gang killing:", "The Black Lives Matter movement is quick to cry foul whenever black people appear to be stereotyped. But what about situations when all the facts point to gang-related activity that is clearly racial and occurs against whites? That was the case in Atlanta, Georgia several weeks ago when a black gang entered the home of an 83-year-old white woman.", "That woman, Dorothy Dow, was sleeping in bed when a gang of four black men and women entered her home, beat her and then set her on fire.

Her attackers are now being charged with murder.", "Dorothy Dow's grandson, Grant Dow, contacted us and confirmed the crime was not motivated by race, but that hasn't stopped a variety of blogs and web sites from claiming it was a case of reverse racism. As a result, Dow said that aside from dealing with his grandmother's death and the resulting criminal trial, he has been forced to try and battle the false narrative, going so far as having to personally convince a white supremacist group to cancel a planned rally in October 2016 over the murder.

It just happened [the suspects] were black, and my grandmother happened to be white.\"", "Dow said he has the word of the white supremacist group, which the Newman Times-Herald identified as Georgia League of the South, that the October rally has been cancelled.

The community pulled together, white, black, law enforcement from different jurisdictions pulled together. If anything this story is a testament to how every thing should work.", "Of course, US Herald didn't provide any evidence (other than the circumstances of the crime) documenting that the race of the victim and suspects was a factor in the killing, and local news reports didn't indicate any racial motivation was behind the attack. Instead, as Dow said, the motivation seemed to be theft, as the attackers apparently demanded money from the victim, then beat her, poured liquid on her, set her on fire, and left.

She then found her cell phone and dialed 911.", "\"With one hand broken and her arm broken in four places, she pulled the top off of a gallon of water, poured it over her head and put out the fire,\" said Dorothy's daughter-in-law Beth Dow. \"She then drug herself into the den on her broken arms to get to her cellphone to call 911.
