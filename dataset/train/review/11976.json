["Hanan Buhari, the youngest daughter of President Muhammadu Buhari, flew to the northern Bauchi state on a jet\u00a0of the presidential fleet on\u00a0January 9, 2020. As soon as pictures surfaced online of Hanan standing next to the plane, Nigerians decried the move as an abuse of power,\u00a0accusing the president\u2019s family of using taxpayers' money to fund private trips.", "Demola Olarewaju, a critic of the president, said Hanan\u2019s use of the plane was \u201ca gross abuse of office, an insult to the poor masses of Nigeria and a waste of taxpayer funds, oil revenue and borrowed monies\u201d. His tweets, archived here, have been shared nearly a thousand times.", "Journalism lecturer Farooq Kperogi, another critic of the president, called the move an \u201cunprecedented abuse of presidential powers\u201d in a Facebook post. Many others have raised the same point, as seen\u00a0here, here, here, and here.", "However, Garba Shehu, special media adviser to the president, told local newspapers it was \u201cnormal practice\u201d for the first family to use the presidential air fleet.", "\u201cIt\u2019s true that a member of the first family was flown to Bauchi [...] on a mission duly authorised. It wasn\u2019t an impromptu or improper trip because it followed normal procedure,\" the adviser said.", "\u201cThe normal practice in existence for a long time is that the presidential air fleet is available to the president and the first family and four others. These four are the vice-president, the senate president, the speaker and any other person(s) authorised by the president.\u201d", "But Lagos-based human rights lawyer Femi Falana said the official policy did not authorise the president\u2019s children to use presidential jets for private social functions.", "\u201cThere is no precedent whatsoever for such privatisation of the presidency of Nigeria,\u201d he said via\u00a0an emailed statement.", "Chidi Odinkalu, former chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), also told a local newspaper that \u201cfor an administration that sold itself on a ticket of integrity, these guys are acting entitled to the point of criminality. Rather than seek to justify it, they should simply apologise\u201d.", "AFP has found this to be a grey area in Nigerian legislation. Jiti Ogunye, a Lagos-based lawyer and newspaper columnist with more than 27 years of experience practising law, also called Hanan's move an abuse of power\u00a0but acknowledged he was\u00a0\u201cnot aware of any law regulating\u201d the use of presidential jets.", "There are currently no laws regulating presidential privileges like the use of private jets. The annual appropriation act - which is passed by the National Assembly and signed by the president - budgets billions of naira for the annual operations of the presidential fleet. In the 2020 appropriation act, N8.5 billion ($23.5 million) have been set aside for the running of the presidential air fleet. However, it does not state if the first family can use the jets for private trips.", "The Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the revenue mobilisation allocation fiscal commission act which regulates the government spending, have no specific guidelines regarding the matter.", "The armed forces act,\u00a0 whose remit includes overseeing the running of the presidential jets, also doesn\u2019t address the issue.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
