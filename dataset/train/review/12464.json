["A shipping vessel that could clog the Suez Canal for weeks is the latest piece added to an ever-evolving conspiracy theory about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other members of a so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d and links to human trafficking.", "Communications channels where QAnon conspiracy theories\u00a0spread were humming this week about a connection between Clinton and the quarter-mile-long ship that ran aground as high winds cut across the canal.", "Those seeped into mainstream social media as well, including posts on Facebook and Instagram, where users tied Clinton\u2019s Secret Service codename to the ship and suggested its radio call sign intentionally matched Clinton\u2019s initials.", "A Facebook user who shared the post did not respond to a request for comment. It speculates without evidence that Evergreen \"is most likely a cover for human and sex trafficking.\"", "Others pushing the same theory allude to the containers being opened on television to reveal trafficked people inside. It is the latest potential disclosure related to the QAnon conspiracy theory that says former President Donald Trump was elected to thwart a deep-state cabal of pedophiles and cannibals, including Clinton.", "At about a quarter-mile long, the ship was built in 2018 as one of the largest in the world, according to the Associated Press. It first got lodged in the canal at about 7:45 a.m. March 23, halting traffic in a key shipping channel between the Mediterranean and Red seas.", "The conspiracy theory goes like this: The ship that is stuck in the canal, the Ever Given, is owned by Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine and carries the radio call sign H3RC. Clinton\u2019s Secret Service code name is Evergreen, and her initials are HRC.", "Those pushing the theory connect the ship to human trafficking but provide no evidence.", "Evergreen denied that it is \"engaged in illegal activity of any sort,\" said Michael Vooss, a spokesman for the company, in an email to USA TODAY.", "The Ever Given can carry up to 20,000 standard 20-foot containers, Vooss wrote.", "\"As such, cargo aboard the vessel at any time can include a wide\u00a0spectrum of goods one would expect might be legally transported within containers,\" he said. \"Evergreen is not now and has never in the past been connected in any way whatsoever to Hillary Rodham Clinton.\"", "Fact check:Antifa was not created by former President Barack Obama and George Soros", "CNN reported in 2016 that Clinton, then the Democratic nominee for president, was keeping the code name assigned to her when she was first lady. Code names for the president\u2019s family generally start with the same letter as the president\u2019s moniker. For example, President Bill Clinton\u2019s code name was \u201cEagle\u201d and Hillary Clinton\u2019s was \u201cEvergreen.\u201d", "Evergreen Marine was established in 1968, according to its website, when Clinton was still in college.", "Ever Given\u2019s call sign is indeed H3RC, according to MyShipTracking.com. But the initials are a coincidence as well.", "The International Telecommunications Union in Geneva, Switzerland, regulates call signs. The union is a \u201cspecialized agency\u201d of the United Nations.", "The first two characters of a maritime call sign \u201cconstitute the nationality identification\u201d for the ship, according to the 2020 edition of the agency\u2019s radio regulations. The H3 characters are assigned by the union to Panama, under whose flag the Ever Given sails, according to those regulations.", "QAnon believers have targeted Clinton as part of several conspiracy theories.", "In one, a decoded email allegedly implicated her and former President Barack Obama in child sex-trafficking. Another from 2018 claims there is video of Clinton and her former aide Huma Abedin sexually assaulting a young girl, according to FactCheck.org.", "Earlier this month, a website wrote that Navy Seals acting on Trump\u2019s order had arrested Clinton, even though Clinton made several public appearances after the alleged arrest.", "Perhaps the most famous of the\u00a0conspiracy theory involving Clinton is Pizzagate, a 2016 presidential election falsehood that claimed Wikileaks had released emails showing Democrats linked to Clinton were running a child-sex ring in the basement of a pizza shop in Washington. A North Carolina man was arrested after firing a rifle into the restaurant.", "None of those conspiracy theories is true. Clinton responded to falsehoods spread about her during an interview with The New York Times in February.", "\u201cFor me, it does go back to my earliest days in national politics, when it became clear to me that there was a bit of a market in trafficking in the most outlandish accusations and wild stories concerning me, my family, people that we knew, people close to us,\u201d Clinton told the Times.", "Vooss called social media posts alleging that Evergreen's ship is being used for human trafficking \"nothing more than wholly-unfounded conspiracy theories\" and blamed a lack of accountability for social media platforms for their spread.", "The claim that a ship stuck in the Suez Canal is a human trafficking vessel with links to Hillary Clinton is FALSE. Those pushing the conspiracy theory offer no proof that the ship is transporting people to be trafficked. The theory is another in a long line of falsehoods spread online about Clinton and human trafficking.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
