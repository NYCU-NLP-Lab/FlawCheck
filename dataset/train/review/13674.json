["In July 2018, Ivanka Trump announced she was closing down her fashion brand to focus more on policy in Washington.", "But a photo circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Ivanka\u2019s brand lives on and is exempt from the tariffs her father, President Donald Trump, has imposed on China.", "The photo appears to show a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes with the label \"made in China\" and a stamp that says \"tarriff exempt.\" (The first clue that this image was tampered with? The word \"tariff\" is misspelled.)", "The image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand is no longer operating, although her company received preliminary approval from the Chinese government for five trademarks in Jan. 2019, which some say could help her resume her business after Trump leaves office.", "After running a reverse-image search, we found that the image of the box has been cropped from a larger photo published by Gawker in March 2016.", "The original photo does include the \"made in China\" stamp, but the misspelled \"tariff exempt\" imprint seen in the Facebook post\u2019s version is not there.", "While her father\u2019s latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods largely targets electronics, Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand likely would be affected if it were still in operation because the items to be taxed also include many types of footwear.", "An image posted on Facebook claims to show a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes made in China with a tariff exempt stamp.", "The image is old, Ivanka\u2019s fashion line is now defunct, and the photo was manipulated to include the misspelled stamp.", "We rate this Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Sept. 12, 2019", "New York Times, Ivanka Trump Is Shutting Down Her Fashion Brand, July 24, 2018", "The Atlantic, A Crack in the Ivanka Trump Brand, July 25, 2018", "CBS, Ivanka Trump receives 5 trademarks from China amid trade talks, Jan. 21, 2019", "PolitiFact, Who pays for US tariffs on Chinese goods?
