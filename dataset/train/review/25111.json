["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on November 22, 2017", "Sen. Bill Cassidy claims he has a way to prevent the Senate tax plan from raising health insurance premiums. He doesn\u2019t.", "In an interview with\u00a0Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto, the Louisiana Republican\u00a0acknowledged that some in his party \u2014 including Sen. Susan Collins \u2014 have concerns about passing a Senate tax bill that would increase health insurance premiums on the individual market by 10 percent.", "As we have written before, the Senate tax bill contains a provision that would eliminate the\u00a0penalty\u00a0on Americans who don\u2019t buy health insurance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have said\u00a0in a joint report that repealing the individual mandate would increase average premiums on the individual market \u201cby about 10 percent in most years of the decade.\u201d", "But Cassidy, who is a\u00a0member of the Senate committees that deal with taxes and health care, told Cavuto that he has a solution. He said that concurrently passing the tax bill and the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act of 2017 \u2013 a bill introduced by Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Republican, and Patty Murray, a Democrat \u2014 would result in \u201cnet lower premiums.\u201d", "Cassidy, Nov. 20: The argument will be that it will increase premiums. CBO said \u2014 and I have an e-mail from them \u2014 that it will raise premiums by 10 percent if you repeal the individual mandate. But if we do the Alexander-Murray bill on the cost-sharing reduction payments, that will actually lower premiums by 25 percent. So we can net lower premiums if we concomitantly put forward the Alexander-Murray bill on cost-sharing reduction payments and lower the deficit.\u00a0So, I do think there`s a way forward, even if Senator Collins is concerned about the individual mandate.", "Cassidy is wrong on two counts: CBO\u00a0has not said the bipartisan health care bill will \u201clower premiums by 25 percent,\u201d so passing both bills would not result in \u201cnet lower premiums.\u201d", "Let\u2019s first explain what the bipartisan health care bill would do.", "Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government provides\u00a0cost-sharing subsidies that\u00a0help reduce out-of-pocket costs for those who earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level and buy their own insurance on the ACA\u2019s state and federal marketplaces. The subsidy payments are made directly to insurance companies.", "The Trump administration last month said that it will no longer make cost-sharing subsidy payments because the Republican-controlled Congress has not appropriated the funds for them. CBO has estimated that ending the subsidies would increase premiums on the individual market by 20 percent in 2018 and 25 percent by 2020.", "The bipartisan\u00a0health care bill would, among other things, continue to provide cost-sharing subsidies for 2017, 2018 and 2019.", "In a joint analysis of the bipartisan health care bill, CBO and the JCT\u00a0said the bill would have no impact on premiums in 2018 and 2019, but\u00a0premiums may rise in 2020 because of the uncertainty about the fate of the subsides that year.", "\u201cCBO and JCT assume that this legislation will not be enacted until after open enrollment for insurance for 2018 begins on November 1, 2017. Therefore, premiums for 2018 plans would already have been finalized and enacting the legislation would not affect premiums for that year,\u201d the joint report says. \u201cBecause CBO\u2019s baseline incorporates the assumption that CSRs will be fully funded for 2019, premiums for 2019 would not change under the legislation, relative to that baseline. To the extent that there is uncertainty in 2020 about whether CSRs will be funded, CBO and JCT expect that insurers would increase premiums in that year relative to the baseline projections.\u201d", "In other words, the joint report says the bipartisan\u00a0bill would not lower premiums; it would prevent premiums from going up by 20 percent in 2018 and 25 percent by 2020. That\u2019s because the CBO and the JCT assume that if the bill passes then cost-sharing subsidies would continue uninterrupted in 2018 and 2019.", "Likewise, the joint report on repealing the individual mandate assumes that the cost-sharing subsidies would \u201cremain in place.\u201d That report says,\u00a0\u201cFor this analysis, CBO and JCT have measured the budgetary effects relative to CBO\u2019s summer 2017 baseline, which underlies the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018. In that baseline, the ACA\u2019s other provisions, including premium tax credits and\u00a0cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies in the marketplaces that the legislation established, are assumed to remain in place.\u201d", "Since both CBO and JCT reports assume that the cost-sharing subsidies would continue, the passage of both bills would not result in \u201cnet lower premiums,\u201d as Cassidy claimed. The passage of both bills would result in a net increase. After the cost-sharing subsidies end in 2019, health care premiums would increase even more.", "Cassidy\u2019s office insists that the senator is right. It tells us that the health insurance rates already have gone up for 2018 and passing both bills will result in a 10 percent to 15 percent reduction in rates, citing the CBO reports we discuss above.", "But that\u2019s moving the goalposts. Cassidy\u2019s office is using 2018 as the baseline year, while citing CBO reports that use 2017 as the baseline.", "It\u2019s true that insurance companies have increased premiums on the individual market for 2018 because of the uncertainty surrounding the cost-sharing subsidies. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of 2018 insurer rate filings with state regulators found that silver plans on the ACA market increased by 7 percent to 38 percent due solely to ending the subsidy payments to insurers. (Those who are eligible for cost-sharing subsidies must choose a silver plan, as opposed to a bronze, gold or platinum level plan, on the ACA markets.)", "But while the bipartisan health care bill would essentially roll back those increases, it would have no impact on the 10 percent rate hike as a result of the tax bill\u2019s repeal of the individual mandate.", "Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for Murray, said Cassidy\u2019s \u201cpoint that Murray-Alexander would \u2018offset\u2019 the damage done by repealing the individual mandate is off base and wrong.\u201d We agree.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
