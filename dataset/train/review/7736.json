Her tweet has garnered over 6000 retweets already.", "The Tamil Nadu based Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK) had launched its manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on March 19, in which it announced a slew of promises. Kishwar has insinuated discrimination against the majority community in the party manifesto, claiming that Pages 85 and 112 of the manifesto suggest that while encroached Waqf properties will be reclaimed and handed over to the Waqf board, in the case of encroachment of temple lands, ownership would be transferred to the encroachers by regularising them.", "Kishwar\u2019s tweet was quote-tweeted by a social media user, whose tweet in turn has been retweeted close to a thousand times. Another quote-tweet has been retweeted over 600 times so far.", "A copy of the manifesto is available on the website of the DMK. Alt News accessed the English version of the manifesto and found that the entire manifesto is merely 76 pages. There are no pages 85 and 112.", "The same was reiterated by the spokesperson of DMK via Twitter.", "This news is so FAKE that it need not be answered but I will.", "There are no Pages 85 & 112.", "Please issue a clarification. https://t.co/QhQZ7oao1i", "\u2014 Manuraj S (@manuraj1983) March 22, 2019", "Further, Alt News found no reference to either the Waqf board or encroachment of temple lands anywhere in the manifesto. The only section dealing with religious matters is the concluding section of the manifesto titled \u2018PROTECTION OF RELIGIONS AND RELIGIOUS HARMONY\u201d found on page 69.", "Alt News found that the reference to protection of Waqf board properties and temple lands was incorporated in the party manifesto of 2016, ahead of the assembly election in Tamil Nadu. Under the section \u2018Welfare of Minorities\u2019 on Page 84, it is mentioned, \u201cProperties of Waqf Board will be recovered from encroachments and protected.\u201d", "Insofar as the question of protection of temple lands is concerned, under the section \u2018Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department\u2019 on page 111, the manifesto clearly spells out, \u201cBesides regulating and collecting rent to be received by the temple trust from temple lands, a Land Bank will be established for protecting vacant land belonging to temples. Moreover, a high level committee led by a retired judge will be constituted for considering the demand of the people, who are offering to purchase the temple land within the legal framework.\u201d The 2016 manifesto of the DMK thus referred to both, protection of Waqf properties AND temple lands.", "It may be reiterated that there is no reference to either the Waqf board or encroachment of temple lands in the DMK manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha election.
