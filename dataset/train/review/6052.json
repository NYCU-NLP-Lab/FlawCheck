["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on September 11, 2020", "In a Labor Day press conference and at a rally in North Carolina the following day, President Donald Trump made several unsupported or inaccurate statements about a COVID-19 vaccine and distorted comments made by the Democratic ticket.", "The president distorted what Biden and Harris have said about a COVID-19 vaccine, calling for them to apologize for their \u201canti-vaccine rhetoric.\u201d The candidates have said that they are supportive of a safe and effective vaccine, but not one based on Trump\u2019s word alone.", "\u201c[Biden and Harris] should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science,\u201d Trump said in his Labor Day press conference.", "\u201cAnd what\u2019s happening is, all of a sudden, you\u2019ll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric \u2014 it\u2019s a politic rhetoric; that\u2019s all it is. Just for politics,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause now they see we\u2019ve done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before.\u201d", "Later, Trump focused on Harris, saying, \u201c[S]he\u2019s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don\u2019t think the achievement was a great achievement.\u201d", "The next day during a rally in North Carolina, Trump repeated the same sentiments, but went further to say that the pair was spreading \u201canti-vaccine conspiracy theories.\u201d", "The White House did not explain which comments Trump was referencing, but he was likely responding to statements Harris made on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d when she said she would \u201ctrust the word of public health experts and scientists\u201d about a vaccine, \u201cbut not Donald Trump.\u201d", "In a clip of the interview, which was released on Sept. 6, Harris said she did not think scientists would get the \u201clast word\u201d on the efficacy of a vaccine.", "\u201cIf past is prologue that they will not, they\u2019ll be muzzled, they\u2019ll be suppressed, they will be sidelined, because he\u2019s looking at an election coming up in less than 60 days and he\u2019s grasping\u00a0for\u00a0whatever he can\u00a0get\u00a0to pretend\u00a0that\u00a0he has been a leader on this issue when he is not,\u201d Harris said.", "Scientists in the administration have\u00a0communicated\u00a0with the public throughout the pandemic,\u00a0although some media appearances have\u00a0been\u00a0limited\u00a0and Politico\u00a0reported\u00a0a Trump adviser unsuccessfully attempted to alter messaging about the coronavirus.", "Harris was then asked if she\u2019d receive a vaccine that was approved and distributed before Nov. 3, Election Day.", "\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s going to be an issue for all of us,\u201d she replied. \u201cI will say that I would not trust Donald Trump. And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he\u2019s talking about. I will not take his word for it.\u201d", "Later in the interview, Harris said that she would trust National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci\u00a0to give an accurate assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine and agreed that at some point in the future there would hopefully be a safe and effective vaccine available. She also emphasized the need for a vaccine distribution plan.", "Biden was asked on Labor Day whether he\u2019d take a COVID-19 vaccine before the election. \u201cI would want to see what the scientists said,\u201d he replied. \u201cI want full transparency on a vaccine. One of the problems is the way [Trump] is playing with politics. He\u2019s said so many things that aren\u2019t true, I\u2019m worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. And so he\u2019s undermining public confidence.\u201d", "\u201cBut pray God we have it,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cIf I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I\u2019d do it. If it cost me the election I\u2019d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut we have to listen to the scientists.\u201d", "The same day at a labor union virtual event, Biden also said he\u2019d take a COVID-19 vaccine \u201c[o]nly if it was completely transparent, that other experts in the country could look at it.\u201d", "Around the time Trump made his remarks at the rally, the Biden campaign released a statement that  outlined multiple ways the government should act to reassure Americans that any vaccine that receives authorization is safe and effective, including making the data publicly available along with statements from Fauci, the career Food and Drug Administration staff and relevant vaccine advisory committee.", "The president can have his opinions on why his challengers made statements skeptical of a Trump-endorsed coronavirus shot, but it\u2019s incorrect to suggest they do not support a coronavirus vaccine that has been fully vetted and properly approved.", "Some scientists have expressed\u00a0concerns\u00a0similar\u00a0to\u00a0those of\u00a0Biden and Harris about the FDA authorizing a vaccine before sufficient phase 3 data\u00a0are\u00a0available.", "In June, University of Pennsylvania professors Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who is a coronavirus adviser to Biden campaign, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times warning that Trump might attempt an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d and release a vaccine prematurely to sway the election.", "Other experts have published similar articles in which they call on the FDA \u2014 the agency that would be responsible for authorization of a vaccine \u2014 not to act too soon or cave to political pressure.", "Offit told the New York Times in August that other scientists working within government shared his concerns, and he told us that he remained worried about politics influencing a COVID-19 vaccine approval.", "He pointed to mounting international pressure and the FDA\u2019s previous decisions during the coronavirus pandemic, including the agency\u2019s emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine \u2014 which was subsequently revoked \u2014 and for convalescent plasma, which has yet to be shown to be safe and effective for COVID-19.", "Of course, not all scientists are anxious that the government will authorize a vaccine without the necessary evidence. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us in June that he had faith in the FDA not to release an insufficiently tested vaccine \u2014 a sentiment he still holds \u2014 but he was nevertheless concerned about the White House\u2019s emphasis on speed.", "\u201cThe messaging coming out of the White House is extremely poor and detrimental,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s actually fomenting distrust and creating a problem.\u201d", "Importantly, there are no signs that the administration will deviate from its plan to authorize a vaccine only after the necessary phase 3 trial data are in.", "In Senate testimony on Sept. 9, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said, \u201cI can\u2019t say strongly enough that the decisions about how this vaccine is going to be evaluated and assessed is going to be based on science.\u201d", "\u201cScience and science alone will be the way in which this decision is made,\u201d he added. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll have no part of it.\u201d", "Fauci has made similar reassurances. He explained in a Sept. 3 CNN interview that the trials have independent data and safety monitoring boards that intermittently look at the data, and noted that the information would ultimately become public. \u201cSo I think that we can have some confidence and have faith in what the FDA is saying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying very explicitly that they\u2019re going to be making the decision based on the scientific data and we hope that that\u2019s going to be the case.\u201d", "In an interview with Science, Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, said there had been \u201cabsolutely no interference\u201d in the process so far and vowed to resign if that changed.", "And on Sept. 8, the CEOs of all of the companies involved in the vaccines receiving U.S. governmental support pledged to make safety a \u201ctop priority\u201d and only submit \u201cfor approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities.\u201d", "Trump boasted of his unique ability to provide for a rapid coronavirus vaccine, saying in his Sept. 7 remarks that \u201cif this were the Obama administration, you wouldn\u2019t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn\u2019t have it all.\u201d", "At the North Carolina rally the following day, he repeated the idea. \u201cThis would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.\u201d", "He has previously made similar claims, including at another North Carolina rally and in remarks\u00a0throughout August.", "It\u2019s his opinion that he alone could pull off a vaccine in record time, but it\u2019s premature to declare victory. And the idea that no other leader could do the same lacks support.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, the key idea behind Operation Warp Speed, which is to manufacture a vaccine before it\u2019s known to work so that it can more quickly be distributed if it ends up being approved, is not new. It was done in 2009 for the H1N1 influenza vaccine.", "Although the effort this time is much larger, given the greater concern of the coronavirus pandemic, there\u2019s no reason to think a different president would not have come up with a similar strategy, as other countries and organizations are using the same approach now.", "Dr. Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response under Obama, noted that similar vaccine efforts were underway in other places around the world and that good progress was being made by companies that didn\u2019t get involved with the U.S. government until recently.", "\u201cWhat the success is really due to is the success of science,\u201d she said.", "Lurie, who now advises the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19, said that previous investments in science and experiences from past administrations are what have allowed a fast response in these extraordinary circumstances.", "\u201cNone of this response would have been possible without prior investments in science and technology,\u201d she said.", "One key realization after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, was that existing vaccine technologies were simply too slow for pandemic situations. In 2010, the president\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology released a report recommending more investment and focusing on more rapid vaccine methods.", "After that report, Lurie said, there started to be investments, largely by NIH, to develop new vaccine platforms, which are bearing fruit today.", "A New York Times article also explains that work underpinning Johnson & Johnson\u2019s viral vector COVID-19 vaccine goes back more than a decade, including efforts to create a Zika vaccine before Trump came into office.", "Collins, the NIH director, also noted during his Sept. 9 testimony on vaccines that the preparation effort has been decades in the making. \u201cThere were things that Congress had done over the past couple of decades, the creation of BARDA, other things that you\u2019ve mentioned, that made it possible to move more swiftly now,\u201d he said.", "The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, which is spearheading the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, was created by legislation President George W. Bush signed into law in 2006.", "While Trump should get some credit for Operation Warp Speed, there\u2019s no support for his claims that other administrations wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve similar results.", "Trump also exaggerated the progress of vaccine trials in his Labor Day press conference.", "\u201cIf you talk to your sources in the FDA, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s going very, very well,\u201d Trump told a reporter when being asked to elaborate on his comments on Biden and Harris. \u201cThe numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.\u201d", "Later, he continued: \u201cYou know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we\u2019re going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.\u201d", "No vaccine company has yet reached its enrollment goal of 30,000 participants for its phase 3 trial, although one is close.", "As of Sept. 7 \u2014 the day Trump made his remarks \u2014 Pfizer/BioNTech had enrolled 25,189 volunteers in 39 states, and Brazil and Argentina.", "As of Sept. 4, Moderna had enrolled 21,411 participants, all within the U.S. That day, the CEO said the company wanted to increase minority participation in the trial, even if that meant slower recruitment.", "The third company currently performing a phase 3 trial in the U.S., AstraZeneca, began a trial in America on Aug. 31, but has not yet started recruitment. On Sept. 8, the company put its trial on hold to investigate a potential adverse reaction in a U.K. woman.", "Although the idea is to test multiple candidates to make it more likely that at least one vaccine will prove successful, there is no guarantee that any of the vaccines being tested will work, despite Trump\u2019s claim that there will be \u201ca good result, one way or the other, very soon.\u201d", "It\u2019s unclear whether Trump means enrollment figures or trial data when he said the \u201cnumbers are looking unbelievably strong.\u201d We asked the White House for clarification, but did not hear back.", "Since the studies are double-blind, neither the president nor anyone within the companies or the FDA knows how well the vaccine is performing in the phase 3 trials so far. The only people privy to that information are those on the data and safety monitoring boards.", "During the Labor Day presser, Trump argued with a reporter about his past statements on when to expect a vaccine, saying that he said \u201cby the end of the year,\u201d not that there \u201cwill\u201d be a vaccine earlier.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t say what you said,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cWhat I said is \u2018by the end of the year.\u2019 But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.\u201d", "We looked through Trump\u2019s past comments on a vaccine, and did not find any cases in which he declared a vaccine would definitely be available by October or November. But he has suggested that the earlier time frame is even more likely. Experts and governmental officials disagree with that assessment.", "Since May, Trump has been saying a vaccine will be ready \u201cvery soon,\u201d usually without specifying what that means. But at a press briefing on Sept. 4, Trump suggested that a vaccine was probable by October.", "\u201cWe remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1st,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October.\u201d", "That evening at a rally in North Carolina, Trump was even more explicit. \u201cIt\u2019ll be delivered, the vaccine, before the end of the year and frankly, maybe even during the month of October. I think October is even more likely.\u201d", "In August, the president also said that he thought it was likely a vaccine would be ready around Nov. 3. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that it\u2019ll be probably around that date,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll have the vaccine before the end of the year certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so.\u201d", "Even in his comments on Labor Day, Trump focused on the earlier dates, mentioning them more frequently than the end of 2020. \u201c[I]t\u2019s going to be done in a very short of period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cCould even have it during the month of October.\u201d", "\u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date,\u201d he said at another point, referring to the election. \u201cYou know what date I\u2019m talking about.\u201d", "Experts disagree with Trump\u2019s rosiest predictions. In an interview with PBS on Sept. 8, Fauci said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d a vaccine would be available by Election Day, and that an answer about how well a vaccine works is \u201cmore likely by the end of the year.\u201d", "\u201cI do have cautious optimism that by the end of 2020, at least one of these vaccines will have emerged and turned out to be safe and effective,\u201d NIH head Collins said in his Sept. 9\u00a0congressional testimony. \u201cBut even that is a guess. And certainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week, before or after a particular date in early November, is well beyond anything that any scientists right now could tell you and be confident that they know what they\u2019re saying.\u201d", "The CEO of Pfizer also clarified his earlier statement that he expected to know whether his vaccine works by the end of October, explaining on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d on Sept. 8 that the time frame was not the same as having shots ready to go into people\u2019s arms.", "\u201cRight now, our model, our base case, predicts that we will have an answer by the end of October. Of course, this is only a prediction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is only an answer.\u201d", "Slaoui, the Operation Warp Speed adviser, told NPR on Sept. 3 that there was a \u201cvery, very low\u201d chance that the trials would provide results by the end of October. Instead, he suggested, it was more realistic to think there would be a limited number of vaccine doses for high-risk groups available by the end of the year, ramping up to cover the rest of the population by the middle of 2021.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
