I think George Bush said it very well in an interview with Sarah McClendon, the grand dame of the Washington press corps. When Bush consented to an interview with Mrs. McClendon in June of 1992, he said on record, which she printed in her newsletter that month, when she asked him about Iran-contra and he said, (and I'm quoting from her newsletter): \"If the people were to ever find out what we have done, we would be chased down the streets and lynched.\" This was a public comment by George Bush.", "Q: George Bush actually admitted that?", "A: He said it and it was printed in Mrs. McClendon's newsletter in June of 1992.\"", "Sarah McClendon covered the White House for over 50 years and in that time most notably ran her one-woman McClendon News Service under which she released the newsletter, \"Sarah McClendon\u2019s Washington Report.\"", "But in a review of McClendon\u2019s June 1992 newsletters, nothing close to the quote that Martin attributed to her could be found.", "So, let us enumerate this claim's flaws:", "First, it is unlikely that Bush, who publicly and vehemently denied any involvement in the scandal (which unfolded while he served as vice president), would say such a self-incriminating statement, especially to a journalist.", "Second, we could find no mention of such a quote in archives of McClendon\u2019s papers.", "Third, if the president made such an inflammatory and self-incriminating statement to the press about a high-profile scandal (especially while it was under heightened attention), it would have been picked up and republished by media outlets across the country.
