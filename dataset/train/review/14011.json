Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than \"yesteryear,\" a rather vague starting point.

That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman.", "But are those numbers reliable?", "The graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science.
