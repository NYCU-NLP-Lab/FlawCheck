["Democrats in the state Legislature were unimpressed when Gov. Scott Walker announced that his second budget would modestly boost school aids he cut substantially in his first.\n\n\"At this pace, it will take nearly 12 years to return to the funding commitment the state made before Walker\u2019s devastating cuts,\" state Rep. Sondy Pope, D-Cross Plains, said in a news release with state Sen. John Lehman, D-Racine. She made the same point in media interviews.\n\nPope, the ranking Democrat on the Assembly\u2019s Education Committee and a state lawmaker since 2002, put it in terms a parent of a school-age child might appreciate:\n\n\"That means a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in his or her education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school,\" her release said.\n\nThe proposed increase is not enough for schools to make ends meet, Pope told reporters as details were leaked in advance of Walker\u2019s 2013-\u201915 budget proposal.\n\nWe won\u2019t judge the impact of Walker\u2019s moves here, but we were interested in whether Pope correctly described the math when talking about how long it would take to restore the aid cuts Walker made in the 2011-\u201913 budget cycle.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look.\n\nState aid is the biggest source of funds for public school districts, which also rely on local property taxes.\n\nPope refers to \"equalized\" aids, the most common form of general state school aids. They are calculated through a formula designed to minimize the differences among school districts\u2019 abilities to raise revenue. Some districts have more property tax wealth than others, as the Legislative Fiscal Bureau puts it. Hence the term \"equalized.\"\n\nSchools have seen significantly less equalized aid in recent years, even before Walker. His predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, cut equalized aid in his final budget, for 2009-\u201911, setting it back to a level not seen since 2005-\u201906. So Walker cut from an already diminished base.\n\nPope\u2019s office showed us their math behind the \"nearly 12 years\" comment.\n\nIt\u2019s based on comparing what Walker\u2019s first budget allocated to the last two-year budget under Jim Doyle.\n\nThe difference is $944 million. Now Walker wants to add back about $129 million in equalized aid over two years. At that pace, it would appear it\u2019s going to be at least 12 years to fill the hole.\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite how Madison budget math works.\n\nWe asked two budget experts to look at this. David Loppnow at the Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan scorekeeper, calculated that it would be about nine years at that pace to get back to the pre-Walker aid levels.\n\nDale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, pegged it at between eight and nine years.\n\nPart of the difference, we found, was that Pope spoke before Walker had released details of how he would structure the $129 million boost. Pope\u2019s office made assumptions on how the money would be divided up between the two years, and was off in its guess.\n\nThe timing affects the calculation because the figure in year two of the budget is the base upon which the next year\u2019s increase builds on.\n\nLoppnow said it was understandable, for that reason, that Pope came up with a different number.\n\nBut the biggest reason for the numbers gap, we found, was that Pope\u2019s method doesn\u2019t account for Walker having added back some funds in year two of his first budget, somewhat alleviating the big aid cut in his first year.\n\nAnd that information was available before Walker released details.\n\nOur rating\n\nPope said it would take Walker \"nearly 12 years\" to make up for his previous cuts in general school aids, based on the pace he set in his proposed 2013-\u201915 budget.\n\nThe best number is about eight or nine years, we heard from two experts. That\u2019s when, as Pope put it, a student will \"enjoy the same state investment in his or her education\" as a student in pre-Walker days.\n\nSo it\u2019s more like middle school or freshman year of high school, not graduation.\n\nWe rate her claim False.", "Rep.
