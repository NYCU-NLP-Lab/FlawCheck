["Dying elephants and rhinos\u2019 tusks and horns pink does not prevent poaching. The idea that it does is very popular on the internet, as several petitions and social media publications in multiple languages show. This Facebook post alone has more than 5,300\u00a0shares and explains that pink dye \u201cmakes the Ivory unsellable and it can\u2019t be consumed. (the animals are not harmed and it is saving their lives)\u201d", "This theory has been called the \u201cpink tusk theory\u201d in the United States. Unfortunately it is only a theory and\u00a0does not work in practice.", "Several elements makes the\u00a0dying of tusks and horns an unrealistic solution. This\u00a0article on the website of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) explains the logistical\u00a0difficulties of attempting\u00a0to dye the tusks of a population of 400,000 elephants.", "In addition to requiring monumental financial resources, it would require the capture and sedation\u00a0of the animals, which could\u00a0put their health at risk.", "\u201cThe perturbations and stress could cause harm on individuals as well as families, the number of animals that could succumb to the procedure has a good chance to be high\u201d wrote Rikkert Reijnen, director of the program against wildlife crime at IFAW.", "Moreover tusks grow constantly, which would require\u00a0a regular repetition of the operation. \u201cEven if it was doable, nothing guaranties that the pink ivory would not become the next trendy product\u201d adds Rikkert Reijnen.", "St\u00e9phane Ringuet, in charge of the fight against trade of endangered species\u00a0at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), agrees. \u201cIt seems illusory to me to imagine that dying elephants\u2019 tusks could have an impact on the behavior of poachers. Personally I don\u2019t believe it for a second\u201d he explained to AFP. He confirmed\u00a0all the elements brought up by IFAW and added\u00a0that \u201cpink is very easily seen in nature, which would attract the attention of anyone, poachers included\u201d.", "For\u00a0Ringuet, \u201cThis should not distract us from other actions that are more important in the fight against poaching, illegal trade or reducing the demand (for ivory).\u201d", "To fight against poaching, the WWF focuses primarily on education in order to reduce the demand for\u00a0these products.", "The inspiration for the pink dye story is an initiative by the Rhino Rescue Project, an animal\u00a0protection association that\u00a0developed a substance which made rhinos\u2019 horns toxic for human consumption. It was created in the hope of dissuading\u00a0poachers.", "Tested in a South African protected park, a side effect of this substance gave horns a neon pink tint when they passed through airport X-ray machines, as shown in this AFP\u00a0video.", "However this pink shade could\u00a0be seen by the naked eye, as this\u00a0photo of a rhino after treatment from the Rhino Rescue Project shows.", "This was all that was needed for the rumor to spread. Although elephants were never part of the initiative, Earth\u2019s largest land mammal became part of the story.", "The WWF estimates that at least 20,000 elephants are killed each year for their ivory.", "In the original picture, the elephant\u2019s tusks are not pink, as can be seen in this video from 2011 :", "Similarly, the rhino\u2019s photo has been digitally altered. The original photo is available in various online image banks. It was taken by photographer Heinrich Van Den Berg.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
