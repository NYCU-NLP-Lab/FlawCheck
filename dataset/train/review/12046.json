Subsequent drafts included the bracketed qualifier that \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms [within his own lands or tenements].\" Although this sentence did not find its way into the final version of the Virginia state constitution, it is documented in The Papers of Thomas Jefferson.", "The sentence \"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government\" appears to be a modern augmentation.
