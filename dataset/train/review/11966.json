["President Donald Trump takes a question from a reporter before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 18, 2019.", "ABC News\u2019 chief anchor George Stephanopoulos spent two days following and interviewing President Donald Trump ahead of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign kick-off in Florida. In one of a series of interviews, Stephanopoulos asked Trump about his pitch to undecided swing voters.", "\"Safety, security, great economy,\" Trump said, before veering off to his 2016 victory and claiming that he \"did very well\" with women voters. Stephanopoulos pushed back, pointing out that Trump \"didn't win women\" in 2016.", "\"Well, I got 52%,\" Trump said, according to an ABC News transcript. \"And I will tell you \u2014 in my opinion I might have won women. ... Hey, Hillary Clinton focused on women, and I did phenomenally well. Many, many, many points above what they thought.\"", "This wasn\u2019t the first time Trump mentioned the 52%. At a March 2018 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump told the crowd:", "\"Hey, didn\u2019t we surprise them with women during the election? Remember? \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump.\u2019 I said, \u2018Have I really had that kind of a problem? I don\u2018t think so.\u2019 But, \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump. It will be a rough night for Donald Trump because the women won\u2019t come out.\u2019 We got 52%. Right? 52. Right?\"", "Trump\u2019s 52% claim is misleading, because it only refers to a subset of women \u2014 white women. He didn\u2019t specify that during the March 2018 rally nor in the ABC interview nor during five other events we found him citing the statistic.\u00a0The Trump campaign declined to comment.", "\"The exit polls make it clear that Trump did not win women,\" said Jennifer Lawless, Commonwealth professor of politics at the University of Virginia.", "Pundits believed Trump would not do well with women because he was running against someone who could become the country\u2019s first woman president and because of sexual assault allegations against him. However, regardless of the candidate, one\u2019s political party identification is the best indicator of whom a voter will elect \u2014 and white women consistently vote Republican, political science researchers told PolitiFact.", "\"Political party is by far the greatest predictor of presidential vote choice, beyond ideology, gender, race and other factors,\" said Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"This is why it isn't surprising Republican women voted for Trump \u2014 partisanship is a stronger predictor of vote choice than gender.\"", "Trump didn\u2019t win a majority of the women vote in 2016. He received 41%, while 54% of women voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit poll data conducted by Edison Research.", "Trump, however, did garner 52% of white women votes. Overall, he won 52% of votes by men and 62% of votes by white men, exit poll data suggests.", "However, \"exit polls do not always paint an accurate portrait of the electorate,\" said Ashley Jardina, an assistant professor of political science at Duke University. \"They are not random and nationally representative and tend to overreport the voting behavior of people willing to stop and talk to pollsters.\"", "Jardina pointed to a study by the Pew Research Center that used data on confirmed 2016 voters and attempted to account for bias in exit polls.", "According to the Pew study, 39% of all women voted for Trump, as did 47% of white women. (No group of women voters supported him at 52% or above.)", "Analysis of national election data has consistently shown that white women favor Republican candidates over Democratic ones, Jardina said.", "The gender gap in the 2016 presidential election was the highest ever recorded in the history of exit polls, according to data from Edison Research cited by the Washington Post.", "This gender gap of 24 points isn\u2019t that shocking in context with recent elections, said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, because it has been steadily increasing since Reagan\u2019s election in 1980.", "\"That doesn\u2019t mean that the GOP candidate can\u2019t win women,\" said Lawless, the University of Virginia professor. \"But it\u2019s a tougher road.\"", "Support from women is a consistent talking point for Trump. Before Election Day in 2016, he falsely claimed to have \"tremendous\" support from women, even though, on average, he lagged behind Clinton in the polls. He also claimed that Clinton didn't \"do very well with women\" \u2014 polling data showed that his claim was Pants on Fire.", "Trump said, \"Well, I got 52% (of women voters). And I will tell you \u2014 in my opinion I might have won women. ... Hey, Hillary Clinton focused on women, and I did phenomenally well.\"", "According to exit poll data, 41% of all women voted for Trump in 2016. Trump\u2019s 52% claim refers to his share of white women.", "Another measure from a Pew\u00a0Research Center study \u2014 using only validated voters and taking potential bias of exit polling into account \u2014 found that 39% of all women and 47% of white women voted for Trump.", "Trump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "ABC News, Transcript: ABC News' George Stephanopoulos' exclusive interview with President Trump, June 16, 2019", "CSPAN, President Trump in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, March 10, 2018", "CNN, Exit polls for the national president, November 23, 2016", "Edison Research, Behind the Numbers: The 2016 National Election Exit Poll, November 10, 2016", "Phone and email interview with Rebecca Kreitzer, assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, June 18, 2019 and June 20, 2019", "Email interview with Ashley Jardina, assistant professor of political science at Duke University, June 19, 2019", "Email interview with Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, June 17, 2019", "Email interview with Jennifer Lawless, Commonwealth professor of politics at the University of Virginia, June 18, 2019", "Washington Post, Trump celebrates winning 52 percent of women in 2016 \u2014 which is only how he did among whites, March 10, 2018", "Associated Press, AP FACT CHECK: Trump inflates his share of women\u2019s votes, March 11, 2018", "Pew Research Center, An examination of the 2016 electorate, based on validated voters, August 9, 2018", "Politics of Color, Hiding in Plain Sight: White Women Vote Republican, November 13, 2016", "Pew Research Center, Behind Trump\u2019s victory: Divisions by race, gender, education, November 9, 2019", "Washington Post, The unexpected voters behind the widest gender gap in recorded election history, November 9, 2019", "Barbara Norrander, \"The Evolution of the Gender Gap\" in The Public Opinion Quarterly, Winter 1999", "PolitiFact, Trump wrongly claims tremendous support from women, November 4, 2016", "PolitiFact, Donald Trump wrong that Hillary Clinton 'doesn\u2019t do very well with women,\u2019 May 2, 2016", "Factbase videos, Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Erie, PA - October 10, 2018, October 10, 2018", "Factbase videos, Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Richmond, Kentucky - October 13, 2018, October 13, 2018", "Factbase videos, Press Conference - Complete: Donald Trump Press Conference - New York - September 26, 2018, September 26, 2018", "Factbase videos, Speech: Donald Trump Addresses Ohio Republican Party State Dinner - August 24, 2018, August 24, 2018", "Factbase videos, Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Wilkes-Barre, PA - August 2, 2018, August 2, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
