["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 14, 2016", "Donald Trump falsely claimed that a \u201ccriminal alien\u201d released from prison in 2012 and later convicted of\u00a0murdering a Connecticut woman in 2015 was \u201cset free by [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s watch\u201d when she was secretary of state.", "In fact, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released Jean Jacques from its custody without the State Department\u2019s knowledge after Haiti refused to accept him, according to a June report by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general.", "\u201cERO [ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations] did not elevate to the State Department Haiti\u2019s refusal to\u00a0accept Jacques, a course of action provided for in ERO\u2019s removal\u00a0guidelines,\u201d the IG report said.", "Trump often blames Clinton at his rallies for the release of \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d from federal custody into U.S. communities. In a speech on Aug. 31, for example, he said: \u201cAccording to a report for the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back.\u201d Trump then added,\u00a0\u201cThese 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch.\u201d", "As we wrote at that time, the Globe wrote that ICE, not the State Department, \u201cfreed 12,941 criminals nationwide from 2008 to early 2014\u201d to comply with a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The court ruled\u00a0that, if another country refuses to accept them, the U.S. cannot hold convicted criminals (who have served their sentences) in detention without justification for longer than six months if their removal from the U.S. is not \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d", "As we also pointed out,\u00a0Clinton was not even secretary of state during the entire time that ICE released those nearly 13,000 criminal aliens. She was secretary of state from January 2009 to February 2013.", "This time \u2014 at an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Trump went even further in claiming that a Haitian man convicted of killing 25-year-old Casey Chadwick of Connecticut\u00a0in 2015 was \u201cset free by Clinton\u2019s watch.\u201d", "Trump, Oct. 10:\u00a0One foreign national and convicted killer who should have been sent back to his home country in 2012 was instead set free by Clinton\u2019s watch. Six months after his release he killed again, murdering a 25-year-old beautiful Casey Chadwick. You probably heard about it.", "Chadwick, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut, was tragically killed June 15, 2015.\u00a0Jacques, a Haitian immigrant, was convicted of her murder on April 11.", "According to a timeline in the IG report, Jacques fled Haiti\u00a0after his father died in 1992, and he was picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard. \u201cAt the time of his arrival to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Jacques did not possess any documents on his person identifying him as a Haitian citizen,\u201d the IG report said.", "In 1997, Jacques was convicted of attempted murder in Connecticut, and he served 15 years in prison. After Jacques served his sentence, ICE took custody of him on April 18, 2012, and tried to deport him. But the Haiti government refused to accept him, \u201cbecause he did not possess\u00a0sufficient documentation to prove his Haitian citizenship,\u201d the IG report said.", "ICE ordered Jacques\u2019 release on Oct. 19, 2012, \u201cconsistent with ICE policy following the Supreme Court ruling\u201d in 2001, the IG report said.", "The IG report noted that ICE could have sought the State Department\u2019s help in seeking a diplomatic resolution to Haiti\u2019s refusal to accept Jacques. But it did not do so.", "IG report, June 16:\u00a0According to the [Enforcement and Removal Operations] Law Division, only the Department of State has the tools necessary to leverage a foreign country into accepting a deportee. Pursuant to Chapter 16.2(b) of the DROPPM, \u201cwhen a foreign country refuses to accept, or unduly delays acceptance, of its nationals found to be deportable from the United States,\u201d ICE may notify the State Department, which in turn \u201cmay suspend immigrant and nonimmigrant visa issuances\u201d for the country. These reports to the State Department should \u201c[i]nclude the date and time of every attempt to obtain a travel documents, the names of consular officials involved, names of aliens affected, and other relevant details.\u201d Following Haiti\u2019s several denials, Jacques\u2019 name was never reported to the State Department.", "According to the IG report, ICE officials \u201cbelieved that the State Department\u2019s involvement was typically limited to aliens engaged in terrorism or human rights violations.\u201d The IG report said its staff did not interview State Department officials about the Jacques case, and it had no reason to doubt ICE\u2019s past experience with the State Department. But it still faulted ICE for failing to attempt to seek the State Department\u2019s help.", "The IG report also was critical of ICE for failing to contact Jacques\u2019 family members in the United States in an attempt to get the documents the agency needed to have Jacques deported. It also noted that\u00a0a Haitian government official\u00a0advised ICE to\u00a0contact the Haitian consulate in Miami to request a travel document, but there is no record of such a request.", "The IG reported added, however, that \u201cwe cannot conclude that those steps would have resulted in Jacques\u2019 removal from the United States.\u201d", "Still, Chadwick\u2019s mother, Wendy Hartling, told the Washington Times that ICE should have done more. \u201cI put the blame on ICE. That\u2019s their job,\u201d Hartling told the paper. \u201cTheir job is to deport criminal aliens.\u201d", "Some members of Congress have called on the Department of Homeland Security and the\u00a0State Department to work together to pressure \u201crecalcitrant countries\u201d to accept criminal aliens.", "For example,\u00a0Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley wrote a letter in June to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in which the senator expressed surprise \u201cthat you have never recommended using 243(d) sanctions\u201d of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under that provision, the secretary of state upon notice from the attorney general \u201cshall order consular officers in that foreign country discontinue granting immigrant visas or nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens, subjects, nationals, and residents of that country until the Attorney General notifies the Secretary [of State] that the country has accepted the alien.\u201d", "The U.S. has not imposed such sanctions, which are to be made after consultation between the secretaries of homeland security and state, on any nation since Guyana in 2001, Grassley\u2019s letter said.", "Michele Thoren Bond, assistant secretary for consular affairs at the State Department, testified in July that the two departments have been working under a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding Concerning Repatriation\u201d since 2011 that addresses \u201crecalcitrant countries.\u201d\u00a0The MOU, which was in place when Clinton was secretary, provides certain options, including \u201cdiplomatic intervention overseas and high-level engagement in Washington, practical measures designed to address resource and capacity limitations, and halting the issuance of visas.\u201d", "In the case of Jacques, however, no attempt was made by ICE to get the State Department involved,\u00a0so Trump\u2019s claim that Jacques was \u201cset free by Clinton\u2019s watch\u201d distorts the facts of the case.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ccebf973-73ab-4f56-be14-edf041f210ad", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
