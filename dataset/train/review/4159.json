True or false?", "California lawmakers have advanced a bill that would prohibit the advertising or selling of \u201csexual orientation change efforts\u201d \u2014 or so-called \u201cconversion therapies,\u201d which many\u00a0medical organizations oppose, including the American Psychiatric Association and the\u00a0Pan American Health Organization, a regional office of the World Health Organization.", "They have not proposed banning the Bible, as\u00a0numerous\u00a0websites have inferred.", "The bill, approved by the California State Assembly on April 19 and now before the Senate, would amend the existing Consumer Legal Remedies Act. It comes nearly six years after California became the first state to ban\u00a0mental health providers from practicing conversion therapies on minors.", "If enacted, the legislation would add sexual orientation change efforts to a list of business practices considered illegal when undertaken \u201cin a transaction intended to result or that results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer.\u201d Specifically, it would outlaw \u201cadvertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual.\u201d", "Sexual orientation change efforts are defined in the bill as \u201cpractices that seek to change an individual\u2019s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\u201d", "Some viral stories\u00a0flagged as potentially false on Facebook argue that the proposal \u201cwould essentially ban the sale of books that include traditional Christian views on marriage and sexuality,\u201d as the site westernjournal.com reported on April 19. Tens of thousands of users interacted with that story, which continued: \u201cShockingly, the proposed law could even be construed to make it illegal to sell Bibles, since they include verses that the far left finds unacceptable.\u201d", "A conservative radio show host went even further in an opinion column on the American Family Association website.", "\u201cThe California Assembly has passed a new bill, Assembly Bill 2943, which will ban the sale of the Bible,\u201d Bryan Fischer writes. \u201cYes, you read that exactly right. The sale of the Bible is about to be made illegal in the state of California.\u201d", "Those claims\u00a0are indeed not supported by the language in the legislation. The bill\u2019s architects \u2014 including Assemblyman Evan Low, who introduced the bill \u2014 also reject such claims.", "A church or individual may still practice conversion therapy if they do so without charging for this fraudulent service.  It does not ban bibles nor does it ban the basic sales of books as some would have you believe.  #leadwithlove @eqca @HRC @TrevorProject https://t.co/cHCQTYhInl", "\u2014 Evan Low (@Evan_Low) April 22, 2018", "Responding to our inquiry to Low\u2019s Assembly office,\u00a0Anthony J.

He said he provided Low with technical assistance on the bill.", "Update, Dec. 6: California State Assemblyman Evan Low, who introduced the bill,\u00a0announced\u00a0in August that he would shelve the legislation and work on crafting a new measure. \u201cDespite the support the bill received in the Assembly and Senate, I will not be sending AB 2943 to the Governor this year,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am committed to continuing to work towards creating a policy that best protects and celebrates the identities of LGBT Californians and a model for the nation to look towards.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "California State Assembly. \u201cAB-2943 Unlawful business practices: sexual orientation change efforts.\u201d (as passed by the State Assembly 19 Apr 2018.)", "Eckholm, Erik. \u201cCalifornia Is First State to Ban Gay \u2018Cure\u2019 for Minors.\u201d The New York Times. 30 Sep 2012.", "\u201cPosition Statement on Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies).\u201d American Psychiatric Association.
