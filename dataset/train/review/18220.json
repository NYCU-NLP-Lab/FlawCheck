["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The compromise to raise the debt ceiling unleashed bipartisan laments from Capitol Hill lawmakers. One Democrat called it a \"Satan sandwich.\" Another grumbled, \"It's evil, or more evil.\"\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss expressed his disappointment with more sober rhetoric. He said he voted against Tuesday\u2019s debt deal because it didn\u2019t do enough to fix the problem.\n\n\"I cannot vote for the largest debt-ceiling increase in America\u2019s history without significant assurances that the bill\u2019s proposed spending reductions will actually be realized, and without reforms to the way our government budgets its spending of taxpayer dollars,\" Chambliss said in a press release the day the Senate passed the deal and President Barack Obama signed it.\n\nIs this the \"largest debt ceiling increase in America\u2019s history\"? Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nChambliss is a member of the so-called \"Gang of Six,\" which has fought for months for a bipartisan solution to cut the nation\u2019s burgeoning federal debt. They floated a plan last month to end the stalemate on the debt ceiling, but it didn\u2019t go far.\n\nThe plan that did pass Tuesday calls for a debt limit increase of up to $2.4 trillion,accompanied by at least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia contacted Chambliss\u2019 press office to get evidence backing his claim. A spokeswoman sent us a July 26, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of the U.S. Congress, and a list of debt ceiling increases from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nFederal laws have limited specific types of debt since 1917, according to the Congressional Research Service. But they did not exist as they do now, as a single limit that covers nearly all debt held by the public, until 1939. The list of debt ceiling increases from the Office of Management and Budget covers 1940 to the present.\n\nIf you compare debt ceiling increases by their dollar amount, Chambliss is right. The only increase that rival\u2019s Tuesday\u2019s debt deal is a $1.9 trillion hike in Feb. 2010. A 2003 increase at $984 billion takes third place.\n\nWe decided to nose around a little more. From our past research, PolitiFact Georgia knows that when economists talk about the size of the national debt, they often express it as a percent of the nation\u2019s economy, or gross domestic product. This comparison gives a clearer sense of the debt\u2019s scale.\n\nTuesday\u2019s deal increases the debt limit by up to $2.4 trillion, which amounts to about 16 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nWe found two other occasions where the increase was greater: World War II and the mid-to-late 1970s.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the cost of the massive war effort pushed debt limit increases to higher than 47 percent of GDP.\n\nThe 1970s increases were blips. During these years, the debt limit spiked repeatedly, peaking at more than 17.9 percent of GDP. In these instances, debt limits expired and returned to prior, much lower amounts. After a few days, Congress restored them to levels only slightly higher than the expired limits.\n\nHow do we rule?\n\nChambliss is correct by one measure -- the dollar amount of debt limit increase. He wasn\u2019t that far off by another -- debt limit increases by percentage of GDP.\n\nIn the case of this second measure, the only times the debt limit rose by an amount that exceeded this year\u2019s increase were the result of highly unusual situations: a world war and legislative blips. \u00a0\n\nWe won\u2019t count the \u201870s data against Chambliss as they resulted in small overall increases.
