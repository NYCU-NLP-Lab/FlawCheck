I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed, and as I\u2019ve said and now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government.\"", "There\u2019s a couple problems with Clinton\u2019s talking point that her State Department predecessors used email practices similar to hers.", "First of all, there\u2019s the fact that most of Clinton\u2019s predecessors did not regularly use email. Just four former secretaries of state have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.", "According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she \"did not use email while she was in office\" from 1997 to 2001. And Rice, head of the State Department from 2005-09, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports.", "So that leaves Powell, a regular email user, as Clinton\u2019s only predecessor who serves as a useful comparison. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they pointed us to Powell.", "Like Clinton, Powell used a personal email address. However, there\u2019s a big difference: Clinton hosted her email on a private server located in her home. Powell did not.", "Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton used are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency, for a prior PolitiFact story.", "And there\u2019s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup.", "The Atlantic speculated the Clintons \"may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties \u2014 whether commercial, hacker, or government \u2014 were able to snoop on them.\"", "The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system\u2019s level of security.", "If the server was managed without the help of a third party, \"you would have to have a staff that\u2019s keeping up with all the latest fixes,\" said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Computer System Security.", "We should note that the State Department has flagged a handful of emails containing information now deemed classified that were received by Powell and aides to Rice at private email addresses. In the more than 50,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department has reviewed, just over 100 sent by Clinton have been deemed classified, according to a Washington Post\u00a0analysis.", "It\u2019s unclear whether the information was classified at the time the emails were sent.", "Our ruling", "Clinton said, regarding her State Department email practices, \"my predecessors did the same thing.\"", "This is a misleading claim chiefly because only one prior secretary of state regularly used email, Colin Powell. Powell did use a personal email address for government business, however he did not use a private server kept at his home, as Clinton did.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "PolitiFact, \"Fact-checking Chuck Schumer's defense of Hillary Clinton's private email,\" March 8, 2015", "PolitiFact, \"Howard Dean: 'Tremendous' number of public officials have done what Hillary Clinton did with email,\" Aug. 18, 2015", "New York Times, \"Among Ex-Secretary of States, Clinton Stands Out (on Email Use),\" March 10, 2015", "New York Times, \"Classified Data Found in Personal Email of Colin Powell and Aides to Condoleezza Rice,\" Feb. 4, 2016", "Washington Post, \"Clinton, on her private server, wrote 104 emails the government says are classified,\" March 5, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
