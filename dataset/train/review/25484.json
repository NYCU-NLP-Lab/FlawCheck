That comes after a sentence stating the center \"provides a safe space for discussions on identity, empowerment, intercultural competency, and the impact of the election.\"", "By phone, Aguirre described the letter as a reminder of services available year-round. Also, he said, it was similar to letters distributed to students through the school year such as at mid-term exams and around Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Aguirre said he put the letter in motion after the election because the school\u2019s Counseling Center had seen an uptick in student visits during the fall 2016 semester. Aguirre said, though, that he he didn\u2019t know if the spike related to the election; confidentiality constraints bar the university from saying why students seek counseling.", "A student's comment", "We wondered if students saw eye to eye with Aguirre regarding the undertones of the open letter.
