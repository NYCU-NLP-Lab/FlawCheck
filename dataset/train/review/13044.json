["Michael Bloomberg appeared on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Aug. 3, 2014.", "Statesmen from nearly 50 African countries are in Washington this week for President Barack Obama\u2019s historic African Leaders Summit, which has been billed as an attempt to strengthen the United States\u2019 economic investments in Africa.", "Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the summit on Aug. 3\u2019s Face the Nation, pointing to investments from Chinese companies in African infrastructure. And education spending, Bloomberg said, is the best evidence of big things to come in Africa.", "\"China has looked at it and said this is a place where because they are spending highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world, although in all fairness it's starting small,\" he said. \"But you are going to create a middle class there that's going to want an awful lot of the products.\"", "\"The next big cities,\" he said, \"are going to be in Africa.\"", "That seemed to contradict the Western trope that African schools aren\u2019t meeting the needs of their students.", "What we found is that Bloomberg is in the ballpark looking at data from 2008 but wrong when looking at more recent numbers.", "Looking back to 2008", "While we didn\u2019t hear from Bloomberg, he may have been thinking of an article in his Bloomberg Businessweek by Howard French, author of China\u2019s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa.", "\"African investment in education, among the highest in the world in terms of percentage of GDP, can barely keep up with the heavy demand for learning,\" French wrote, going on to cite Africa\u2019s recent gains in school enrollment across all levels of learning.", "French referred us to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, \"Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies.\" That report pegs Africa\u2019s public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 5 percent in 2008. That\u2019s \"a smaller portion than the OECD countries\u2019 6 percent,\" they wrote, \"but more than in Latin America or some Asian countries.\" The OECD, or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \u00a0is composed of 34 countries in every continent except Africa that are generally considered developed and high-income.", "The above graph from a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report expands on the data from the McKinsey study and looks at spending per region across the globe. Both reports, we should note, only look at public spending on education -- data on private education spending isn\u2019t readily available for non-OECD countries.", "If you take education spending as a percentage of government spending, not GDP, Africa actually beats out the OECD, 20 percent to 11, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. But looking at 2008 figures -- as did all the reports we found that looked at education spending for continents -- Bloomberg\u2019s wrong. Africa\u2019s close, and their progress on education is impressive by other measures, but the world\u2019s developed nations spend proportionally more on education.", "Updating the data", "But part of the buzz about Africa is that its governments are rapidly increasing their spending on education. For instance, a 2011 UN report noted that Africa had increased its education spending by an average of 6 percent a year from 2000 to 2010.", "The 2008 data also isn\u2019t perfect, because some notable countries are missing, including China.", "So we set out to update the UN and McKinsey\u2019s analysis with more recent data.", "Every year, UNESCO publishes public education spending as a percentage of GDP for every country where it\u2019s available, which works out to less than half of the 196 recognized countries almost every year. The World Bank keeps a database of these numbers, year-by-year.", "To update the stats from UNESCO and McKinsey, we took the World Bank\u2019s dataset and removed every country that hadn\u2019t published new data since 2008. Then we took the most recent figure for the remaining 160 countries, and multiplied each country\u2019s percentage by its most recent GDP figure from the World Bank to get an estimate for total education spending for each country.", "The data for every country is the most recent available, though the data isn\u2019t the same year for every country.", "We then broke down the countries into geographic regions using a UN classification -- which segregates countries more or less by continents -- and took the total education spending for each region and divided it by each region\u2019s total GDP to get weighted averages. The results:", "Source:\u00a0PunditFact.com", "As you can see from the chart above, Africa lags behind Latin America and Oceania, in addition to Northern America (the UN name for North America) and Europe.", "The picture could look different for education spending as a percentage of government spending instead of GDP -- African countries\u2019 spending on education is increasing alongside their GDPs, albeit at a slightly slower rate -- but that\u2019s not how Bloomberg framed his claim.", "Our ruling", "On Face the Nation, Bloomberg said that Africa is spending \"the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world\" in the course of praising China\u2019s investment in Africa\u2019s growth.", "Reports from the United Nations had Africa\u2019s proportional spending on education higher than everywhere but North America and Europe in 2008. But since then, Africa\u2019s overall economic growth has outpaced its governments increasing spending on education. Our calculations based on the most recent available data put Africa\u2019s proportional spending beneath every continent except Asia.", "African countries do spend more of their governments\u2019 budgets on education than many developed countries, so Bloomberg\u2019s broader point about Africa\u2019s growth has some merit. But Bloomberg\u2019s claim cited GDP.
