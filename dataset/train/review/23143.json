["Death and taxes have nothing on the inevitability of attack ads during election season.", "And since we live in Georgia \u2013 where an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in May found that 86 percent of voters see a candidate\u2019s stance on the Affordable Care Act as a very important factor in their vote \u2013 it was another certainty that the federal health care overhaul also known as Obamacare would get prime billing.", "Enter \"Bad Idea,\" a Republican Governors Association ad against Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator locked in a tight race against Gov. Nathan Deal.", "It opens with claims that health care premiums will increase under the law before asking why Carter would say expanding the Medicaid program to more low-income Georgians \"should be on the table.\" Then, the hammer:", "\"And why would Jason Carter support using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare?\" it asks.", "Carter\u2019s staff disagrees with that assessment, saying his vote on an anti-Obamacare bill was about information, not taxpayer money.", "And that\u2019s exactly the sort of conflict that sets the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter aquiver.", "Jon Thompson, the RGA\u2019s press secretary, pointed us to House Bill 943, which bars state or local government employees from advocating for the Affordable Care Act and prevents creation of a state-run health insurance exchange. It also prohibits the use of state or local money to hire people to help Georgians sign up for coverage under the law.", "Carter was among 17 senators who voted against the measure, 16 of them Democrats.", "\"This law says we will not use our resources to implement a federal policy that our state disagrees with,\" said state Rep.

That leaves his few statements open for interpretation \u2013 and political attack.", "This week, Carter told the AJC that expanding Medicaid would be one way to secure federal money to help keep rural hospitals open in the state.", "But Thomas, when asked whether Carter supports Medicaid expansion, said the candidate would also look at whether Georgia could get the same deal that Arkansas secured, to take new Medicaid money from the federal government to help the uninsured poor buy insurance on the private market.", "Thomas called it \"a false choice\" to answer yes or no if Carter would support Medicaid expansion as governor.", "\"It\u2019s not a yes or no question,\" Thomas said.", "That kind of non-answer answer does Carter no favors. Mischaracterizing his stance isn\u2019t hard to do when he won\u2019t give clear answers to the policy questions on voters\u2019 minds.", "In summary, though, it is still a stretch to conclude that Carter\u2019s objection to one anti-Obamacare bill translates into support for spending state taxpayer money on the law.", "PolitiFact could not find any specific tax increase that Carter supported as a state senator, shoring up his office\u2019s claims that it would be out of the norm for him to vote in favor of a measure if he believed it would increase taxes.", "But because Carter\u2019s stance has been so fuzzy, it opens the door for interpretation about what he really believes.", "We rate the GOP claim as Mostly False.", "Republican Governors Association Georgia Ad: Bad Idea", "A health care Q&A with Jason Carter, Athens Banner-Herald", "Georgia State House Bill 943", "Health care law casts long shadow ahead of pivotal election", "Interview with state Rep.
