["During an April 8 broadcast, in the usual Republic Bharat mannerism, channel anchors Shweta Shrivastav and Shweta Tripathi yelled a piece of \u2018breaking news\u2019 onto television screens. As the camera shifted focus from Shrivastav on the top floor of the studio to Tripathi on the ground, viewers were told that eight family members associated with Tablighi Jamaat tested positive for coronavirus in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Khargone.", "The anchors contacted channel correspondent Satyavijay for further details. He blamed Noor Mohammad for spreading the infection to his family and claimed that Mohammad had visited Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi after returning from a foreign trip. He subsequently came back to Khargone where he did not inform local authorities that he showed symptoms for COVID-19, added Satyavijay further stating that Noor Mohammad died on March 28. He also said that Mohammad\u2019s mother passed away. \u201cJamaat is the root of coronavirus cases in Madhya Pradesh,\u201d declared the channel correspondent adding, \u201cHad Noor Mohammad informed on time, he would have perhaps been kept in isolation.\u201d", "Shrivatsav concurred with Satyavijay\u2019s opinion and termed members of Tablighi Jamaat \u201cshameless\u201d \u2013 a word that was continually flashed on TV screens along with similar words such as \u2018badtameez (ill-mannered)\u2019, \u2018behudi (stupidity)\u2019 and \u2018besharam jamaati (shameless jamaati)\u2019.", "ANI tweeted on the case on April 8.

I had informed the health officials about my trip to South Africa which they were already aware of since the local administration had kept a list of all people with a history of foreign travel.\u201d None of the family members was admitted to the hospital at the time since they did not run a fever. \u201cMy fever wasn\u2019t continuous and it used to act up at night. It is possible that my temperature was recorded normal as the health officials had visited during the day,\u201d said Mohammad adding that he was advised home-quarantine.", "It is worthwhile to note that testing strategies have been evolving in the country as the disease is progressing. According to earlier guidelines by the Ministry of Health, testing was mostly limited to symptomatic people with a travel history or close contacts of positive cases. This explains why health officials were more concerned about Mohammad\u2019s trip to South Africa. His visit to Nizamuddin was of little consequence on March 24 when the area was not identified as a hotspot.", "On March 31, reports came pouring in about a cluster of cases from the Tablighi Jamaat event held last month. \u201cI contacted the doctors again and told them that I\u2019m coming down to the hospital with my wife,\u201d said Mohammad.

Alt News verified the questions in the form as mentioned by Mohammad with copies of the form uploaded online by others. Mohammad was not screened at the airport because he did not show symptoms for coronavirus. After returning to Khargone, Mohammad and his entire family were examined by medical officers on March 24. The officers visited his residence because they were aware of his foreign trip. No one from the family was admitted, including Mohammad\u2019s parents aged 70 plus, as their temperatures were normal.
