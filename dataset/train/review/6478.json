["Actor James Woods took aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter, using her own words against her to suggest she would create a \"nanny state.\"", "Woods tweeted an image attributing to Clinton a quote from her 1996 book, It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, asking viewers to \"Read this. Twice.\"", "\"I believe the primary role of the state \u00a0is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role,\" the quote reads.", "There\u2019s just one problem. The quote is a complete fabrication, and we\u2019ve shown this before.", "In March, we fact-checked the exact same image Woods tweeted. At the time, we looked at her book on Google Books and searched for the quote both on Google and on Lexis-Nexis.", "We did not find the quote then, and we didn\u2019t this time after re-doing the search. The Clinton campaign declined to comment. We found quotes from the book making the opposite point.", "\"Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters \u2014 to feed them, to sing them to sleep, to teach them to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop spiritual lives, to make countless daily decisions that determine whom they have the potential to become,\" the book says on page four.", "The word \"secondary\" does not even show up in the book, our search showed.", "It Takes A Village has been criticized for suggesting society was responsible for parenting children, and Clinton does argue that society at large \u2014 government included \u2014 has a role in a child\u2019s development.", "\"But I was also blessed with caring neighbors, attentive doctors, challenging public schools, safe streets, and an economy that supported my father\u2019s job,\" she wrote. \"Much of my family\u2019s good fortune was beyond my parents\u2019 direct control, but not beyond the control of other adults whose actions affected my life.\"", "She does not say, however, that \"parents have a secondary role,\" as Woods alleged.", "Paul Kengor, a professor of political science at Grove City College and a Ronald Reagan biographer, said there is a typical divide in how conservatives and liberals (such as Clinton) view child care. He said it was conceivable Clinton would support a primary role for the state due to her liberal persuasion.", "William Chafe, a history professor at Duke University, disagreed. He said the book's message was to uphold a community commitment to the well-being of women and children, not to shift responsibility, calling the latter a \"willful misreading.\"", "What societal role is too much is for readers to decide, but the quote is fabricated.", "Our ruling", "Woods claimed that Clinton wrote that \"the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role.\"", "That\u2019s a bogus quote attributed to Clinton\u2019s book It Takes a Village.", "We rate Wood\u2019s claim Pants on Fire!", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35155d42-dcb3-42d1-98e0-c97b41e96061", "PolitiFact, \"7 Hillary Clinton quotes on the Internet that are complete fakes,\" March 23, 2016", "Personal Tweet, James Woods\u2019 Twitter account, July 31, 2016", "Google Books, \"It Takes A Village,\" December 1996", "Google Books, \"It Takes A Village,\" December 2006", "Email response from Josh Schwerin, Hillary Clinton spokesperson, August 1, 2016", "Email response from Paul Kengor, professor of political science at Grove City College, August 1, 2016", "Email response from William Chafe, Alice Mary Balwdwin professor of history at Duke University, August 1, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
