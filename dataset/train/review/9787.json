Accompanied by a dramatic photograph of a massive chasm in an urban center, the Geographic article reported:", "Human activity, not nature, was the likely cause of the gaping sinkhole that opened up in the streets of Guatemala City on Sunday, a geologist says.", "A burst sewer pipe or storm drain probably hollowed out the underground cavity that allowed the chasm to form, according to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, who is currently living in Guatemala City (map).", "The Guatemala City sinkhole, estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) wide and 300 feet (100 meters) deep, appears to have been triggered by the deluge from tropical storm Agatha.", "But the cavity formed in the first place because the city\u2014and its underground infrastructure\u2014were built in a region where the first few hundred meters of ground are mostly made up of a material called pumice fill, deposited during past volcanic eruptions.", "The crater formed in the center of an intersection, and perhaps because aerial photographs are so visually striking, they have been shared throughout the years since the event occurred:", "This 30-story sinkhole appeared smack in the middle of Guatemala City. https://t.co/QlIPV4EVZi pic.twitter.com/hglMjoKJYT", "\u2014 David Plotz (@davidplotz) May 26, 2017", "That wasn't the first time a massive sinkhole opened up in Guatemala City.

That placement, combined with swift-running water from unfixed underground leaks, contributed to formation of the craters", "\"In Guatemala City [the pumice is] unconsolidated, it's loose,\" Dartmouth geologist Sam Bonis told the Geographic in 2010. \"It hasn't been hardened into a rock yet, so it's easily eroded, especially by swift running water.\" Tropical storm Agatha, coupled with leaking sewage pipes, likely triggered the collapse in 2010.", "Bonis added that because the event wasn't driven by natural forces, it technically shouldn't be called a \"sinkhole.\" There was no scientific term, he said, to describe this type of collapse.", "Than, Ker. \u00a0 \"Guatemala Sinkhole Created by Humans, Not Nature.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Geographic. \u00a0 5 June 2010.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Third Body Pulled from Giant Sinkhole.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 24 February 2007.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
