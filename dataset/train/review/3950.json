He is also being put on a suicide watch. Apparently two African-American prisoners were responsible for the assault according to the correction officer who was on duty.", "Although the item was appeared on the fake news web site NYMeta in July 2015 (not long after Roof's initial identification and arrest), the outwardly undated piece was spread again after his December 2016 conviction led to his name again appearing in headlines. The storyline appealed to many social media users' desire for justice due to the gravity of Roof's crime and his targeting of peaceful black congregants.", "However, items published by NYMeta (largely inactive in December 2016) were not meant to be taken seriously. Before claiming Roof was raped in prison, the site featured items asserting a morbidly obese woman gave birth to a 40 lb. baby, that Facebook's \"rainbow filter\" was a danger to users, and that Kansas kindergarteners were exposed to Ebola via a substitute teacher.", "A disclaimer on the site reads:", "NY Meta is an entertainment website.
