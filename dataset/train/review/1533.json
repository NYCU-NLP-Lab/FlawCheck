The event was part of a nationwide protest against the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Rosen participated.", "The group billed the national action as the \"Repeal the Trump Tax Tour,\" saying the new tax law \"will raise taxes for 92 million middle-class families, rip health care away from 13 million people, and threaten life-saving programs \u2014 all to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.\"", "According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018, but those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners.", "For its stop in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2018, the group called on Republicans to \"repeal the Trump Tax on middle-class Families,\" as the group\u2019s press release put it.", "We watched the full video of the event.", "Rosen left no room for doubt that she opposed the Republican tax cuts.", "\"This tax bill at its core is a giveaway to special interests and the wealthy,\" Rosen said. \"And it will disadvantage millions of working families in the long run.
