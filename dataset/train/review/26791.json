This\u00a0claim is false; Joe Biden defeated incumbent US president Donald Trump in the 2020 election; as of December 4, Trump\u2019s legal challenges to prove what he claims were instances of voter fraud in some states have all failed, with officials saying there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud; the misleading posts shared screenshots of a YouTube video that was not produced by a reputable media organisation.", "One misleading post, which includes five screenshots, was published here on Facebook on November 28, 2020. It has been shared 216 times.", "The Burmese-language post translates to English in part as:\u00a0 \"Trump is returning. He wins.\n\n\t!!Trump fought back and won very easily.\u00a0\n\n\tI didn't say it. The American military news reported it.\u00a0\n\n\t\u201cIt's now sure. Zuckerberg is also jumping in it. I'll write more details tonight.\"", "Joe Biden defeated incumbent president Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November 2020. Biden won the electoral college vote -- the state-by-state competition deciding the winner -- by 306 to 232. In the popular national vote, which does not decide the result but still has political and symbolic heft, Biden won by 51 to 47 percent. Despite the result, Trump has refused to concede.\u00a0 Here is an AFP report on the election.", "On November 23, 2020, the General Services Administration (GSA) acknowledged Joe Biden as the winner, US broadcaster CNN reported here.", "A similar claim was published here on Facebook with two of the same screenshots.", "The first Facebook account published a similar post here on Facebook on November 24 claiming that\u00a0Trump won the election.", "The claim is false; Biden won the US presidential election in 2020.", "The screenshots in the posts show Trump, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, US polling station staff and Trump supporters.

The channel is also not currently verified by YouTube, as seen here.", "The US Military News video does not specifically say that Trump won the election, but makes a series of statements about Trump challenging the 2020 election result. As of December 4, 2020, none of Trump\u2019s legal challenges have been successful and officials have dismissed allegations of widespread voter fraud. Here is an AFP report on the developments.", "The video also makes reference to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $400million donation to help local election offices during the coronavirus pandemic, as reported here by UK news site The Independent.", "It speculates that Trump could challenge Zuckerberg\u2019s donation as part of his effort to overturn the 2020 election result.", "Zuckerberg announced here on Facebook on September 1 that he had donated $250million to local election offices.", "He later increased his donation, bringing the total to $400million, but as of December 4, 2020 he has not been prosecuted for any offence.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
