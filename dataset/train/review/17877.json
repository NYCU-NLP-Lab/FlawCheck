["About this rating", "In the early days following the Nov. 3, 2020, general election, U.S. President Donald Trump and his surrogates undertook an effort to spread disinformation that undermined voter confidence in the democratic process as it became clear that Trump's political rival Joe Biden would become the president-elect.", "When television networks announced that Biden was the projected winner of the presidential race, having amassed the majority of electoral college and popular votes, Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, stood at a podium to hold a news conference in a strip mall parking lot outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia.", "Giuliani was flanked by a man claiming to be a Philadelphia resident and GOP poll watcher in Pennsylvania who wasn't allowed to observe ballots being counted \u2014 but it turned out that man was Daryl Brooks, who has frequently run unsuccessfully for political office in New Jersey.", "The news conference followed a tweet from Trump that appeared to suggest a ritzier, well-known downtown location \u2014 namely the luxury Four Seasons Hotel and Resorts.", "But that was not to be the case.
