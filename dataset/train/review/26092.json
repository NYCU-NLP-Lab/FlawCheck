["About this rating", "The day after Thanksgiving is the day millions of Americans, enjoying a rare Friday off (and a dearth of football games on television), kick off the Christmas shopping season.", "\"Black Friday\"\u00a0is regularly cited as \"the busiest shopping day of the year.\" But although Black Friday may be the day the greatest number of holiday shoppers traipse through stores, it isn't necessarily the biggest day of the year in terms of dollars spent:", "Popular belief has it that the Friday after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year.", "These days many shoppers buy with the holidays in mind all year long. Decorations go up around Halloween, and some Santa Clauses arrive at malls before Thanksgiving.

To be sure, there are still intense crowds on the day after Thanksgiving \u2014 led by the \"doorbusters\" who show up at dawn for early-bird sales.", "'It's one of the busiest days in terms of traffic but not in sales,' said Pam Rucker, spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation. 'But the mystique is still there.'", "'People just want to get out and do something on that day,' said Jay McIntosh, director of U.S. Retail and Consumer Products for accounting giant Ernst & Young. 'They do because of all of the incentives to shop, but many aren't buying.'", "(\"Black Friday\"\u00a0supposedly\u00a0got its name because it's the day when retailers turn the corner and see their income statements move out of the red and into the black; however,\u00a0originally the phrase was a derisive term applied by police and retail workers to the day's plethora of traffic jams and badly-behaved customers)", "Previous holiday shopping trends showed sales figures spiking on the day after Thanksgiving before suffering a sharp decline through the end of November. However, sales would steadily increase throughout December, peaking on the four days comprising the two weekends before Christmas.
