["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on March 25, 2019", "Rep. Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, misrepresented the facts regarding two key moments in the special counsel\u2019s investigation of President Donald Trump and his campaign:", "Nadler, a New York Democrat, appeared March 24 on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d to discuss\u00a0the special counsel\u2019s investigation\u00a0of\u00a0the Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and whether those efforts were coordinated with the Trump campaign.", "Two days earlier,\u00a0Attorney General William P. Barr\u00a0notified\u00a0Congress that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had concluded his investigation and submitted a confidential report to the Justice Department.\u00a0Nadler reiterated his position that Mueller\u2019s report should be made public, and then addressed the issue of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.", "Nadler, March 24: I mean, obviously, we know there \u2014 we know there was some collusion. We know that the president\u2019s son and campaign manager were involved in a meeting with the Russians to receive stolen \u2014 what they thought was to receive stolen information \u2014 information stolen by the Russians from the Democratic National Committee, as part of the Russian government attempt to help Trump in the election.\u00a0That\u2019s the way the email inviting them to the meeting put it.", "Nadler is referring to an\u00a0email\u00a0that\u00a0music publicist Rob Goldstone sent to Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, that said Russian pop star Emin Agalarov had asked Goldstone to contact Trump Jr. on behalf of his father,\u00a0Aras Agalarov, a Russian real estate developer.", "\u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d Goldstone wrote in the June 3, 2016, email. \u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d", "There was no mention in that email of how the \u201cvery high level and sensitive information\u201d was obtained, legally or illegally, or what kind of information the \u201cofficial documents\u201d contained.", "Further, Nadler said the \u201cstolen information\u201d came from the DNC. But, at the time of Goldstone\u2019s email, the public had yet to learn that the DNC\u2019s computers had been hacked or that Russians were suspected of being responsible for it. That first became known\u00a0June 14, 2016 \u2014 when the Washington Post broke the story \u2014 11 days after Goldstone\u2019s email and five days after\u00a0Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, then Trump\u2019s campaign convention manager, met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others at Trump Tower. (See \u201cTimeline of Russia Investigation\u201d for a timeline of events.)", "Nadler said that Trump Jr. and Manafort \u201cthought\u201d they would \u201creceive stolen information\u201d from the DNC because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the way the email inviting them to the meeting put it.\u201d We can\u2019t say what Trump Jr. or Manafort were thinking at the time, but the email did not say anything about stolen information from the DNC.", "We asked Nadler\u2019s office where in\u00a0Goldstone\u2019s\u00a0email did it say the Russians would provide the\u00a0Trump campaign with \u201cstolen information,\u201d but we received no response.", "Later in the interview, Nadler addressed the issue of whether the president obstructed justice. He specifically cited Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI Director James Comey as an example of possible obstruction.", "Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, and the former FBI director testified a month later that the president pressured him to end the FBI\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.", "In written testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, Comey said the president asked him for his loyalty at a Jan. 27, 2017, dinner and asked him to drop the Flynn investigation at a Feb. 14, 2017, meeting. Comey also said Trump asked in March and April of that year that the FBI \u201clift the cloud\u201d over his administration and publicly announce that he is personally not under investigation.", "Nadler, March 24: Let me say further, we know a number of things. We know what I just said. We know that the president pressured the FBI to go easy, to stop investigating Flynn and various other people. We know that he fired the FBI director, as he put it to the \u2014 to NBC, to take care of the Russian thing, in order to stop the investigation of various people associated with him.", "Trump discussed his reasons for firing Comey during a May 11, 2017, interview with Lester Holt on NBC. But Nadler misrepresented what Trump said to NBC.", "Trump told\u00a0Holt that he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he decided to fire Comey, and that he would have fired Comey with or without Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s recommendation.", "\u201cHe made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it,\u201d Trump told NBC. \u201cAnd, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\u2019\u201d", "Trump went on to say that he fired Comey even though it might extend the FBI investigation \u2014 contrary to Nadler\u2019s claim that Trump told NBC he fired Comey \u201cto take care of the Russian thing\u201d and end the investigation into people associated with the president.", "Trump, May 11, 2017: When I did this now, I said I probably maybe will confuse people. Maybe I\u2019ll expand that \u2014 you know, I\u2019ll lengthen the time because it should be over with. It should \u2014 in my opinion, should\u2019ve been over with a long time ago because it \u2014 all it is an excuse. But I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation. But I have to do the right thing for the American people. He\u2019s the wrong man for that position.", "Nadler may suspect that Trump\u2019s motives were less than altruistic, but he\u2019s wrong to say Trump told NBC that he fired Comey\u00a0\u201cto take care of the Russian thing, in order to stop the investigation of various people associated with him.\u201d", "Hours after Nadler\u2019s interview on CNN, Attorney General William P. Barr\u00a0sent\u00a0Congress a four-page letter that summarized Mueller\u2019s confidential report. Quoting from Mueller\u2019s report, Barr said:\u00a0\u201cAs the report states: \u2018[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.'\u201d", "As for possible obstruction of justice, Barr told Congress Mueller\u2019s report \u201cdid not draw a conclusion \u2026 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.\u201d Barr wrote, \u201cThe Special Counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u2019\u201d", "Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein concluded that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to show the president had \u201ccommitted an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
