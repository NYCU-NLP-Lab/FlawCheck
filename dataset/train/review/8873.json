(AP)", "A Time\u00a0magazine cover photo of a young immigrant girl sobbing as she looked up at President Donald Trump became a symbol of the criticism over Trump\u2019s immigration policies, but the iconic image was misleading.", "Several headlines on Facebook challenged the image, including this headline by The Gateway Pundit which largely drew from an article by The Daily Mail.", "\"Shock: Migrant mother and \u2018crying girl\u2019 on Time cover never separated; mom deported in 2013, left husband with good job, 3 other kids, paid coyote $6k to sneak back in U.S.\"", "Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment,\" Time's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement to CNN published June 22.", "Moore told the Washington Post that Time corrected the story after he made a request minutes after it was published.
