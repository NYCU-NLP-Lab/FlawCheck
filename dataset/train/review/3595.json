A post from October on a Zambian Facebook page called \u2018Dr Gilliard Pharmacy\u2019 claims that drinking wild aubergine mixed with water will make cancer \u201cdisappear\u201d.", "A reverse image search on the Facebook page\u2019s profile picture, which shows a man wearing a stethoscope, reveals he is not \u2018Dr Gilliard\u2019 but actually an American doctor called Paul Rivas, whom we can see talking in this video about his weight loss pills.", "Many comments on the posts express gratitude for the advice or ask for more information about the recipe.", "However, medical professionals told AFP that the claim is false and warned of the risks of turning to herbal remedies to treat cancer.", "\u201cThere is no scientific evidence that wild aubergine plant can cure cancer,\u201d said Dr Samuel Smith, associate professor at the Leeds Institute of Health Sciences in the UK.", "\u201cThe scientific consensus from high quality large trials shows that natural and herbal treatments do not affect cancer outcomes, and could cause serious harm,\u201d he told AFP by email.", "Cancer Research UK\u2019s head information nurse Martin Ledwick said patients should speak to their doctor before considering any alternative or complementary medicine.", "\u201cHerbal medicine and so called \u2018natural\u2019 cures have not been properly tested and should not be relied on.
