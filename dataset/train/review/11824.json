Kenya's foreign ministry has not issued a statement,\u201d read the caption on the Facebook post, which was shared 100 times and attracted more than 400 comments and reactions. We\u2019ve archived the post here.", "To track down where the photo came from, we carried out a reverse image search on Google which revealed that it first appeared online on July 14, 2019, in an article published by the Zambian Observer. So it was already clear that it was not taken during the recent xenophobic violence in South Africa, which began on September 1.", "The article on the Zambian Observer describes an assault on a man by a machete-wielding gang as he went to visit his wife\u2019s grave.

It was a very traumatizing day and it is unfortunate that through the circulation of this picture I am forced to relive the events of the day,\u201d he added.", "AFP also conducted an interview with Haambote via WhatsApp video, where he was wearing the shirt he was attacked in.", "Haambote directed us to a July 14, 2019\u00a0Facebook post he wrote about the assault two years previously, noting that the Zambian Observer had lifted his words from his personal account.", "He told us: \u201cThat Saturday I was visiting my wife\u2019s tomb to place flowers, a tradition I had developed since her passing more than three years ago.
