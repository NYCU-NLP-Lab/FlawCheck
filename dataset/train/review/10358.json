Gowdy confirmed to us that he did not write the post in question.", "Former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina has publicly weighed in on some issues concerning the novel coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. politics surrounding it.", "But the former Republican congressman did not write a more than 400-word conspiracy theory circulating on Facebook that implies, without any proof, that the outbreak was planned to help Democrats in the 2020 election.", "\u201cFrom Trey Gowdy,\u201d the post begins. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Covid-19 isn\u2019t real\u2026 But Pay attention folks, there\u2019s much more going on here than what meets the eye.\u201d", "It goes on to claim, among other things, that \u201cthere is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment\u201d and that \u201c[i]t all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election.\u201d", "It\u2019s unclear why or when Gowdy, a high-profile congressman who served from 2011 until Jan. 3, 2019, became tied to the viral text post.

Stay safe and strong.\u201d", "In an email to FactCheck.org, Gowdy confirmed that his statement was referring to the viral COVID-19 post.", "Some versions of the post tying the text to Gowdy were updated in light of his Facebook statement.", "One such post appeared on the Facebook page of Beatrice Cardenas, a Republican congressional candidate in California, and used the Gowdy attribution and an image of the former congressman. It remains up and has been shared 48,000 times, but an update was added at the bottom reading: \u201c4/22 EDIT: several people have sent me a message posted by Trey Gowdy making a disclaimer about posts attributed to him he did not write. We are unsure who was the original author.\u201d", "Still, multiple versions of the post leave the false attribution in place \u2014 and new ones are still being published.", "And other iterations have used different attributions altogether. Another post of the same text was credited to former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, even though there\u2019s no evidence it was his work, either.
