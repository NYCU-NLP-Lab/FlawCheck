["By Robert Farley", "Posted on February 19, 2021", "President Joe Biden this week boasted on Twitter about his promise to administer 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, \u201cWith the progress we\u2019re making I believe we\u2019ll not only reach that, we\u2019ll break it.\u201d But as some critics have noted, it was a pretty low bar to begin with.", "On the day Biden was inaugurated, the U.S. administered nearly 1.5 million shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s COVID Data Tracker. On that day, the seven-day average for the previous week was about 966,000 shots a day. In other words, the U.S. was already virtually at the pace Biden set as his goal before he took any action as president.", "By Biden\u2019s second day in office, the seven-day average was at the 1 million doses per day average needed to meet his 100-day goal.", "Before I took office, I set a big goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days. With the progress we\u2019re making I believe we\u2019ll not only reach that, we\u2019ll break it.", "\u2014 President Biden (@POTUS) February 16, 2021", "The goal seemed more ambitious when Biden first announced his \u201c100 million shots in the first 100 day\u201d goal in a Dec. 8 speech in Wilmington, Delaware, as president-elect. At that point, vaccinations hadn\u2019t even begun yet.", "A New York Times story that day called it an \u201cambitious\u201d goal and said \u201cfulfilling it will require no hiccups in manufacturing or distributing the vaccine and a willingness by Americans to be vaccinated.\u201d The reporters said the experts they spoke to found Biden\u2019s timeline to be \u201cachievable\u201d but \u201coptimistic.\u201d", "It still seemed like an \u201cincredible goal,\u201d as Biden put it, when he talked about the promise on Dec. 29, less than two weeks after the first vaccine doses were administered.", "\u201cIt would take ramping up five to six times the current pace to 1 million shots a day, but even with that improvement, even if we boost the speed of vaccinations to 1 million shots a day, it will still take months to have a majority of the United States population vaccinated,\u201d Biden said.", "The day before he made that speech, Dec. 28, two weeks into distribution, the U.S. had administered a total of 3.5 million doses of vaccine. So measuring from Day One, the daily average was about 250,000 \u2014 and it would take four times that rate to get to Biden\u2019s goal of 1 million a day.", "But even then, Biden was misleadingly ignoring the upward trend. On Dec. 29, the day of Biden\u2019s speech, the CDC reported that 686,411 vaccines were administered \u2014 or roughly two-thirds of what would be needed to meet Biden\u2019s daily goal. The seven-day average that day was 317,766.", "To be sure, the vaccine rollout was slower than expected at the beginning. Although then-President Donald Trump had promised to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020, the total at year\u2019s end was just 5.4 million.", "But the number of doses administered continued to trend upward during the final weeks of the Trump presidency. On Jan. 7, a little more than a million doses were administered, and the seven-day average was up to 542,000, according to the CDC. By Jan. 14, the seven-day average was up to 918,000 doses per day.", "Despite the upward trend, an article in USA Today on Jan. 14 continued to call Biden\u2019s 100-shots-in-100-days promise \u201ca lofty goal to reverse a slow start to the nation\u2019s vaccine rollout.\u201d", "That same day, Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden\u2019s COVID-19 task force, called Biden\u2019s goal \u201caspirational \u2026 but doable\u2019\u2019 and warned that the \u201cfirst days of that 100 days may be substantially slower than it will be towards the end.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to occur quickly \u2026 you\u2019re going to see the ramp-up occurring only when the resources really begin to flow,\u201d Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told STAT news.", "But by that time, the average number of daily doses was already nearing the 1 million shots a day threshold needed to meet Biden\u2019s promise. And by Jan. 20, the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration \u2014 a day that saw nearly 1.5 million vaccines administered \u2014 the seven-day average was about 966,000.", "The following day, Jan. 21, another roughly 1.5 million doses were administered, bringing the seven-day average to over 1 million per day. After Biden gave a speech on the COVID-19 response, a reporter asked if \u2014 given the pace of vaccination he inherited \u2014 Biden shouldn\u2019t have set his bar higher.", "\u201cWhen I announced it, you all said, \u2018It\u2019s not possible.\u2019 Come on, give me a break man,\u201d Biden responded.", "At a press briefing later that day, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was also asked why Biden wasn\u2019t \u201cshooting just a little bit higher.\u201d", "\u201cWell, none of us are mathematicians, myself included, so I asked our team to do a little math on this,\u201d Psaki responded. \u201cSo, the Trump administration was given 36 million doses when they were in office for 38 days. They administered a total of about 17 million shots.\u00a0 That\u2019s about less than 500,000 shots a day. What we\u2019re proposing is to double that to about 1 million shots per day. And we have outlined this goal and objective in coordination and consultation with our health and medical experts. So it is ambitious. It\u2019s something that we feel is bold and was called that certainly at the time, and we\u2019re working overtime to help to achieve it \u2014 try to achieve it.\u201d", "Psaki\u2019s math is roughly accurate, but again, it misleadingly ignores the trend line, and the fact that the U.S. had virtually reached the 1 million doses per day average in the week before Biden took office.", "Indeed, many experts were underwhelmed by Biden\u2019s goal.", "\u201cI think we probably need to be a bit more audacious in these goals,\u201d CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air shortly after Biden bristled at the reporter who asked if the goal shouldn\u2019t be higher.", "Gupta praised the Biden administration\u2019s vaccination plans, particularly for expanding the role of the federal government in helping states to administer the vaccinations.", "But given the number of vaccinations occurring by the time Biden took office, Gupta said the administration may be \u201cunder promising and with the hope of over delivering.\u201d", "In remarks on Jan. 25, Biden seemed to acknowledge the low bar, suggesting the U.S. might beat his goal by 50%.", "\u201cI think, with the grace of God, and the goodwill of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to \u2026 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,\u201d Biden said.", "But by the following day, he had retreated back to his original \u201cambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.\u201d He added that was \u201cnot the endpoint; it\u2019s just the start.\u201d", "By Feb. 9, the seven-day average had already moved beyond 1.5 million doses per day. According to an NBC News tracker of Biden\u2019s vaccination goal, the U.S. is on pace to reach 150 million doses in Biden\u2019s first 100 days, which ends April 29.", "In a press briefing on Feb. 17, a reporter asked Psaki about Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 comment in an interview that aired Feb. 14, \u201cIn many ways, we [the Biden administration] are starting from scratch on something that\u2019s been raging for almost an entire year.\u201d Was that appropriate, the reporter asked, given that the U.S. was administering nearly a million shots a day in the week before Biden took office?", "\u201cWhen the president came in and the vice president came in, there were not enough vaccines, there were not enough vaccinators, there were not enough vaccination locations,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken significant steps to address all of those issues. Yes, in the week prior to the president taking office, there were about 800- to 900,000, as you said, doses doing \u2014 being given a day. The average was about 400- to 500,000 prior to that. Last week, the average was 1.7 million a day. So there are significant steps that have been taken.\u201d", "The Biden administration is free to boast about its efforts to ramp up vaccinations, which experts have also praised. But Biden and Psaki are spinning the facts. Although the initial rollout was slow under Trump and many first viewed Biden\u2019s goal as ambitious, vaccinations steadily increased each week, nearly reaching 1 million doses a day when Biden took office.", "At the current rate, there\u2019s no reason to think the U.S. won\u2019t \u201cbreak\u201d Biden\u2019s goal of 100 million shots in 100 days, as he boasted on Twitter.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
