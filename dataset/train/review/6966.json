["About this rating", "On 2 December 2016, a \"satirical\" site \u2014 which contains a disclaimer buried deep on its \"About Us\" page \u2014 posted a hoax story (\"Obama Crushed After Trump Orders White House to Stop His Sickest Tradition\") that reported outgoing United States President Barack Obama was seen storming out of the White House because of the cancellation of one of his most \"secretive rituals.\"", "According to the article, Obama secretly ordered White House staff to order silence in the building during the five daily Muslim prayers, collectively known as the Salat or Salah. The story also accuses Obama of making prayer rugs available in order to make Muslims more comfortable. However, it says, President-elect Donald Trump put a stop to the practice and ordered \"all pagan symbols\" to be removed from the property:", "Obama was seen storming away from the West Wing after staffers from Donald Trump\u2019s transition team began preparing the Executive offices for the new administration. On Trump\u2019s orders, one of Obama\u2019s most secretive rituals is being reversed and all signs of it removed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.", "To further its spurious claim, this story features a photo of Muslim men in prayer, suggesting that it was taken as part of this \"secret\" ritual. The picture was taken at the White House \u2014 by attorney Qasim Rashid \u2014 but the prayer was actually part of a special event in July 2016:", "Re-sharing historic picture of Imam Azhar Haneef of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community leading prayer in White House pic.twitter.com/QPEKJ7tvyR", "\u2014 Qasim Rashid, Esq.
