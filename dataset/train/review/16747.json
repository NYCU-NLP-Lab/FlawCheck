I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here.\"", "Perkins replied: \"Well, we're seeing in Washington state, Colorado, and some of the other states that have these anti-discrimination statutes that are being imposed, that when a same-sex couple comes and says, \u2018I want you to take pictures of my wedding,\u2019 or \u2018I want you to bake a cake.\u2019 And they say, \u2018Look, my religious convictions will not allow me participate in that,\u2019 they're literally being sued by the government, not the individuals, and they've even been adjudicated in such places as New Mexico. So we're going to see a loss of religious freedom. There is no question about it. It's already happening.\"", "Have there been bakers who have laid down their wire whisks and refused to bake a cake for a gay couple and hauled off to jail? A florist nervously piecing together a floral arrangement under the threat of a cop? We decided to investigate.", "State anti-discrimination laws used in some legal challenges", "In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal benefits for married same-sex couples, and it dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California\u2019s law that banned gay marriage. The Prop 8 ruling means that same-sex couples in California can now get married again, but neither ruling makes gay marriage legal in every state -- currently 12 states allow gay marriages.", "While same-sex marriage laws can include exemptions for religious clergy who don\u2019t want to officiate such unions, there aren\u2019t typically exemptions for wedding vendors. So it\u2019s possible for gay couples to take legal action against wedding vendors who refused to serve them if there are state or local anti-discrimination laws in place that include sexual orientation. About 21 states have such, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for gay rights. (Florida isn\u2019t one of them, although some counties or cities have such laws.)", "\"These nondiscrimination laws say you cannot refuse to serve a couple because of sexual orientation,\" said Sarah Warbelow, an attorney and state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign. \"If you are a photographer and a same-sex couple comes to you and says we want to employ you, the photographer for whatever event -- whether it's a marriage ceremony, commitment ceremony or whether it\u2019s a birthday party -- the laws of those states state you cannot refuse them on basis of sexual orientation.\"", "Each state can have their own process and penalties -- the ones we reviewed are generally heard before a civil rights or human rights commission.", "It\u2019s theoretically possible a vendor who lost such a lawsuit could face jail if they refused to comply with the order, but Warbelow said, \"I\u2019ve never heard of anyone actually going to jail.\"", "Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado", "The Family Research Council directed us to multiple cases, including one particular case that they argue includes the threat of jail: Masterpiece Cakeshop. In 2012, a gay couple visited the suburban Denver shop in search of a cake for a Colorado celebration following their Massachusetts wedding.", "After the cake shop refused, the ACLU initiated a complaint on behalf of the two men. The Colorado attorney general\u2019s office later filed a formal complaint which will be heard before the state\u2019s civil rights commission in September. The owner has said, \"We would close down the bakery before we would compromise our beliefs.\" The cake shop\u2019s lawyer, Nicolle Martin, has said if the owner loses he could face up to a year in jail.", "In the meantime, though, the Colorado Legislature has taken action to repeal the criminal penalties for discrimination in places of public accommodations, which had included up to a year in jail and/or a $300 fine. The provision had never been used, and the repeal coincided with legislators passing a civil unions bill.", "We reached bill co-sponsor state Sen.

The owners didn\u2019t face jail based on the complaint itself. However, under Vermont law, failure to pay a fine can lead to a civil contempt action.", "\"This is no different than any other defendant who has a judgment against him/her and refuses to pay,\" director Karen Richards told PolitiFact in an email. \"As a practical matter, most unpaid judgments do not result in contempt proceedings, nor do they result in incarceration, except in very extreme cases, such as child support cases, where the party clearly has the money and is basically thumbing its nose at the court. I am not aware of any case in Vermont that resulted in a jail time for a defendant in any type of discrimination case.\"", "In New Jersey, the Methodist Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association refused to allow a lesbian couple to hold a ceremony at its boardwalk pavilion in 2007.

In Oregon, a TV news station reported that Sweet Cakes by Melissa co-owner Aaron Klein allegedly told a lesbian couple that \"they were abominations to the Lord\" and refused to fill the order.

We couldn\u2019t find any evidence that a vendor had been sent to jail or that any legal authority had threatened jail time.
