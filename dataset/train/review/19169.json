(Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)", "While James\u2019 campaign said in 2018 that he supports an exception to abortions in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk, James and his campaign have repeatedly dodged questions on the matter.", "James supports overturning Roe v. Wade, which would make Michigan\u2019s pre-Roe abortion ban enforceable. The law makes administering an abortion a felony in all cases except where the mother\u2019s life is at risk.", "In a Facebook ad, Democratic incumbent Sen. Gary Peters says that when it comes to abortion, his Republican challenger John James is \"out of touch and too extreme\" for Michigan.", "\"John James opposes abortion, even refusing to make an exception when a woman\u2019s life is at risk\" and \"wants to make it a felony even in cases of rape and incest,\" Peters\u2019 ad claims. Peters is hoping to hold on to his seat in a state that President Donald Trump narrowly won in 2016.", "There is no question that James is on the record as opposing abortion. But we wanted to take a closer look at Peters\u2019 characterizations.", "We found that James has repeatedly dodged questions when asked whether he would make an exception to abortion prohibtions in cases where a mother\u2019s life is at risk. Meanwhile, James favors overturning Roe v. Wade. The 1973 Supreme Court case invalidated Michigan\u2019s 1931 law that makes it felony to administer an abortion in all cases except when the mother\u2019s life is at risk. This law is still on the books and could be enforced if Roe v. Wade is overturned. James has not said whether he supports Michigan\u2019s pre-Roe abortion ban.", "James anti-abortion stance is clear. In a 2018 tweet, James wrote, \"I am 100% #ProLife because I believe life begins at conception and ends at a natural death. We will not stop fighting until we end abortion, for it is our sacred duty to protect the most vulnerable among us:\u00a0the unborn.\" During a July 13, 2018, campaign event, James called abortion a form of \"genocide,\" according to audio released by the Michigan Democratic Party.", "Whether James supports an exception when a mother\u2019s life is in danger is less clear. When James ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2018, his campaign said he supports an exception in such cases, but neither James nor his campaign have answered questions on his position since.", "Ahead of the 2018 primary election, when James was asked in a WILS-AM 1320 interview whether he supports exceptions in cases where the life of the mother is at risk or preganancies resulting from rape or incest, he answered: \"I believe the focus should be given to maintaining and protecting life and exhausting every remedy to wrap our arms around both the mother and the baby, making sure that we eliminate situations that put our women in these terrible situations that no one wants to be in.\"", "Asked again in that same interview whether he would criminalize abortions in cases where the pregnant woman\u2019s life was in jeopardy and the pregnancy needed to be terminated to ensure the mother\u2019s survival, he responded, \"if somebody\u2019s life is in danger, you\u2019re going to the hospital. You\u2019re not going to Planned Parenthood. You\u2019re creating a false dilemma.\"", "During his 2020 campaign against Sen. Peters, James\u2019 campaign has continued to avoid the matter.", "In an interview on WXYZ-TV Detroit Oct. 4, James was asked whether is pro-life. James responded, \"I am pro-life and I will always vote to protect life, especially the life of the mother.\" But he did not specifically say that the life of a mother would be cause for an exception.", "During his 2020 campaign against Peters, James\u2019 campaign has continued to avoid the matter. James\u2019 campaign has stood out for not taking clear positions on a range of issues. Campaign spokesperson Abby Walls did not clarify whether James opposes exceptions to abortion for cases where a mother\u2019s life is at risk when asked by a reporter for MLive. Walls declined to respond to a request for comment on James\u2019 position from PolitiFact Michigan. But she did send a statement criticizing the ad: \"As a 30-year career politician, Sen. Peters\u2019 lies and half-truths are so frequent, it\u2019s almost impossible to keep track.\"", "Peters\u00a0campaign press secretary C.J. Warnke defended the ad in an email: \"John James has said in his own words that he is \u2018100% pro-life\u2019 and does not support Roe v. Wade \u2014 that means outlawing abortion and putting a woman\u2019s life at risk.\"", "With Republicans in the Senate hoping to vote on Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, activists on both sides of the issue are preparing to mobilize voters. In 2016, Trump promised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.", "The Detroit Free Press reported in 2018 that \"James made it clear he couldn't support any judge who didn't openly call for abortion to be outlawed except in almost all cases.\"", "James has also received a number of endorsements from pro-life groups, including the Susan B. Anthony List, Right to Life of Michigan and the Family Research Council Action\u2019s PAC.", "Peters\u2019 claim that James wants to make administering an abortion in cases of rape or incest a felony needs context. James has said Roe v. Wade should be overturned. If that happened, abortion regulations would revert to individual states.", "\"Michigan has a law on the books from 1931 that criminalizes virtually any form of abortion. It\u2019s unconstitutional right now because of Roe,\" said Merissa Kovach, policy strategist for ACLU of Michigan. \"We could very quickly overnight become a state where virtually all abortion is criminalized.\"", "Michigan is one of only nine states in the U.S. with a pre-Roe abortion ban that has not been repealed. Michigan\u00a0law stipulates that any person who administers an abortion is guilty of a felony. The law makes an exception in cases where the abortion is administered to save a woman\u2019s life but makes no exception in cases of rape or incest.", "That said, James has not said whether he specifically supports Michigan\u2019s pre-Roe ban.", "A Gary Peters campaign ad says \"John James opposes abortion, even refusing to make an exception when a woman\u2019s life is at risk\" and \"wants to make it a felony even in cases of rape and incest.\"", "This lacks context.", "While James\u2019 campaign stated in 2018 that he supports exceptions to abortion prohibitions in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk, he has not provided a clear answer about where he stands now. Neither James nor his campaign have reiterated his support for such an exception, but neither he nor his campaign have said he would oppose them either.", "Meanwhile, James\u2019 has been clear in his stated support for overturning Roe v. Wade, an action that would result in abortion regulations reverting to individual states. Michigan\u2019s pre-Roe abortion ban makes administering abortion a felony except in cases where it is necessary to save a woman\u2019s life. But James has not said whether he supports Michigan\u2019s pre-Roe ban.", "The ad\u2019s claims are partially accurate but leave out important details or take things out of context. We rate the ad\u2019s claims Half True.", "UPDATE, Oct. 9, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect James\u2019 comments on Oct. 4 , 2020, to WXYZ-TV Detroit.
