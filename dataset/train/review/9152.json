["About this rating", "Several analyses have calculated that Trump, as of October 2019, incurred around $109 million in taxpayer spending related to his golf outings, which is close to the amount of money a president would make if he were being paid $400,000 annually for 278.5 years.", "However, no single, correct number exists regarding the cost of Trump\u2019s golf outings due to the multiple ways one can approach this question. Further, the level of precision implied by the figure \u201c278.5 years\u201d is not reflective of reality, given the assumptions made in the calculations.", "On Aug. 16, 2019, Huffington Post White House correspondent S. V. D\u00e1te tweeted that U.S. President Donald Trump had, at that point in time, spent \u201c278.5 years of annual presidential salary in taxpayer money to play golf.\u201d This statistic served as a headline to a viral Politicus USA article posted the next day.", "Assessing the validity of this statistic requires knowledge of two numbers: the president\u2019s annual salary and the amount of money Trump has cost taxpayers via trips to golf clubs. The first number is easy: It\u2019s $400,000, as stipulated by Congress. The second number is a bit more challenging to derive with precision. The number would necessarily include costs like transportation, security, and other logistical support, but how these items are calculated involves estimates or assumptions.", "Huffpost\u2019s methodology was what they described as a \u201cconservative approach\u201d based on a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report of Trump\u2019s first four outings to Mar-a-lago as president. One example of the kind of choices people estimating these costs have to make, they noted, concerns how much of the per-hour Air Force One cost to add to the golf outing calculation:", "The HuffPost analysis took a conservative approach to determining costs. For example, it used a per-hour rate of $15,994 for Trump\u2019s use of the smaller Air Force One that he takes to Bedminster, New Jersey, even though that figure accounts only for fuel and maintenance, not the additional factors that GAO used when it determined the $273,000-per-hour cost of operating the larger plane.", "The 278.5 years of presidential salary would equate to $111,400,000 in total costs up to August 2019, when D\u00e1te tweeted the statistic. This number, to give a sense of the range of estimates, was a bit higher than a figure promoted within the body of the Politicus USA article, which cited the Trump Golf Count website as calculating, at the time of their reporting, \u201c207 golf trips ... at a cost to taxpayers of $108 million and counting.\u201d Trump Golf Count is run by self-described data junkie Sophie Germain and dedicated to tracking the president\u2019s golf time.", "At the time of our reporting here, October 2019, that website reports that Trump has spent $109,505,631 of taxpayer money on visits to golf properties broken down in this way:", "Trump Golf Count Cost Breakdown:", "Total Cost: $109,505,631", "Divided by $400,000, this total represents 273.8 annual presidential salaries \u2014 still below the headline claim of 278.5 years. These differences are negligible if you take into account how precise the above numbers actually are, however. As Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler put it, such figures \u201care a great example of false precision. We do not know exactly how many days Trump has golfed, and we do not know how much has been paid by taxpayers for his golf outings.\u201d That being said, Kessler noted that Germain's estimates were \u201cin the ballpark\u201d of figures released by the Government Accountability Office. Still, he argues that \u201cone cannot fairly attribute all of these costs to golf, given the round-the-clock security required for a president.\u201d", "The bottom line is that multiple analyses have calculated figures that are in rough agreement with either Germain's or D\u00e1te\u2019s claims that the cost is presently in the $109 million area, but numbers as precise as those stated in tweets mislead a reader into thinking a level of accuracy not reflective of reality has been achieved. The numbers vary, additionally, based on how one approaches the problem: Do you include all the maintenance costs for Air Force One? Do you include security costs that would be present regardless of golf outings? There is no one right answer, and as such there is no single number that can be verified as the number.", "For these reasons, we rank the claim that \u201cTrump spent \u201c278.5 years\u201d of presidential salary on taxpayer-funded golf outings as a \"Mixture.\"", "UPDATE:", "As of Sep. 21 2020, according to Trump Golf Count, Trump has golfed 279 times during his presidency, costing taxpayers an estimated 141 million dollars.
