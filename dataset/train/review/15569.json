In 2015, he was already warning Americans that the country was unprepared for an inevitable infectious virus.", "More recently, he\u2019s become a target for misinformation concerning the pandemic. We\u2019ve debunked several claims, including that he said \"church services can\u2019t resume until we\u2019re all vaccinated,\" that the Gates Foundation paralyzed nearly 500,000 children testing a polio vaccine, and that the foundation has a patent for the coronavirus.", "An image lurking in certain corners of the internet has a similar theme. It shows what looks like the corner of a foundation building, with the words \"Bill & Melinda Gates foundation\" seemingly etched in the facade. Above that? These words: \"Center for Global Human Population Reduction.\"", "\"Right out in front for the world to see their plan,\" reads one Facebook post sharing the image.", "It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The image appears to be a doctored photo of 500 Fifth Ave N., the foundation\u2019s headquarters in Seattle. We searched for that address in Google Maps and found this photo, which shows the foundation\u2019s name and the street number 500, just as it appears in the image on the Facebook post, but without the name of the supposed center.", "The corner of the building is also visible in the Google Maps street view. The \"Center for Global Population Reduction\" marking doesn\u2019t appear on the building.", "The foundation\u2019s 2018 annual report, the most recent available, makes no mention of such a center or even population. We also didn\u2019t find that center searching the foundation\u2019s website.", "But allegations that Bill Gates is wielding vaccines to thin human herds aren\u2019t new. In 2018, for example, we fact-checked a false story that he had a \"plan to depopulate the planet.\" That claim was wrong, and as several other fact-checkers have found, so is this one.", "We rate this Facebook post False.", "Facebook post, April 28, 2020", "PolitiFact, Bill Gates warned in 2015 that we were unprepared for an infectious virus, March 25, 2020", "PolitiFact, Fact-checking a Facebook conspiracy about Bill Gates, Dr. Fauci and COVID-19, April 14, 2020", "PolitiFact, No, Bill Gates didn\u2019t say no church services until everyone is vaccinated, April 13, 2020", "PolitiFact, Anti-vaxxers spread conspiracy about Bill Gates and India\u2019s polio vaccination, April 23, 2020", "PolitiFact, No, Bill Gates did not outline 2018 plan to depopulate the planet, May 3, 2018", "Photo of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, visited April 4, 2020", "Google Maps street view of 500 5th Ave N., Seattle, WA, visited April 4, 2020", "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2018 annual report", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
