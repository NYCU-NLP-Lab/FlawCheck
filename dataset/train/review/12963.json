["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Former\u00a0Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said\u00a0it doesn\u2019t make sense that President Andrew Jackson will no longer be the centerpiece of the $20 bill because he was the last master of the federal budget.", "Carson, who now backs Donald Trump, lamented the 19th century president\u2019s displacement in an April 20 interview on Fox Business.", "\"Well I think Andrew Jackson was a tremendous secretary \u2014 I mean a tremendous president,\" Carson said. \"I mean, Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.\"", "Black abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who rescued slave families using the underground railroad, will replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill, while a smaller image of Jackson\u2019s face will appear on the back. Jackson\u2019s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, presided over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land.", "We wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson\u2019s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt.", "A lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn\u2019t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget.", "However, this wasn\u2019t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial.", "The history", "Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt.", "(Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.)", "In January 1829, the debt was about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today\u2019s dollars, that amounts to about $1.4 billion. The total public debt outstanding today is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion.", "Jackson watched that debt scale down to zero in 1835. According to the Treasury Department, the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office.", "But Jackson didn\u2019t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson\u2019s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said Daniel Feller, a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee.", "\"The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president\" when the debt hit zero, Feller said.", "In addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads.", "He also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School.", "Immediately following Jackson\u2019s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson\u2019s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame.", "\"The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country's enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,\" Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero.", "While the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn\u2019t the only president who presided over a balanced budget.", "In today\u2019s world, it\u2019s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, only five years have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush.", "But in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to government historical tables. Before that, we don\u2019t have \u00a0year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from 1800 through 1850, so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point.", "\"Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick,\" as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said.", "Our ruling", "Carson said, \"Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.\"", "Experts say this feat doesn\u2019t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last \u2014 and only \u2014 president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget.", "The statement is accurate but needs added context, which is our definition of Mostly True.", "New York Times, \"Harriet Tubman Ousts Andrew Jackson in Change for a $20,\" April 20, 2016", "Treasury Direct, \"Historical Debt Outstanding - Annual 1790 - 1849,\" accessed April 20, 2016", "Treasury Direct, \"The 19th Century,\" accessed April 20, 2016", "Treasury Direct, \"The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It,\" accessed April 20, 2016", "White House Office of Management and Budget, \"Historical Tables: Budget of the U.S. Government,\" FY 2017", "PBS, \"Indian removal,\" accessed April 21, 2016", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Vern Buchanan says balanced budgets are rare in Washington,\" May 7, 2010", "Email interview, GW Law professor Neil Buchanan, April 21, 2016", "Phone interview, University of Tennessee professor Daniel Feller, April 20, 2016", "Email interview, historian Franklin Noll, April 21, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
