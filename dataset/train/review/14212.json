Both the Getty Images visual media site and the original photographer's website identify this image as having been taken at an Imperia U.S. launch party at the Statue of Liberty on September 7, 2005, when Cyrus was just 12 years old. The woman seen here with Epstein is clearly older than 12.", "By contrast, this is what Cyrus looked like in 2005, when she auditioned for the \"Hannah Montana\" role.", "Neither of the photography sites linked above identifies the young woman seen in this picture by name. Although that information is available elsewhere, we have chosen not to include it here for privacy reasons related to an ongoing criminal case.", "CBS News. \u00a0 \"Ghislaine Maxwell Could \"Squeal' on \"Very Well-Known Names,' Epstein Accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre Says.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 July 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
