["About this rating", "In October 2017, two disreputable web sites published an item claiming that a morbidly obese Iowa teacher had been arrested after \"sitting on an understudy\u2019s head and flatulating in his mouth abandoning him heaving for air.\"", "The claim first appeared on the World News Daily Report:", "An Iowa teacher at Kensington elementary school has been suspended from her functions after allegedly sitting on a student\u2019s head and farting in his mouth leaving him gasping for air.", "The 34-year-old teacher, Ann Margaret DeVille, apparently wanted to teach the student a valuable lesson after the young man allegedly made a public comment on her \u201cugly fat ass.\u201d", "\u201cShe pushed him to the ground, lifted her robe and just sat her ass on his face and then just let out the biggest fart in front of all his classmates,\u201d she added.", "\u201cHe was gasping for air. He thought he was going to die,\u201d explained the victim\u2019s mother to reporters.", "The post was peppered with additional lurid details.

The photograph of \"Ann Margaret DeVille\" was published to Imgur on 6 May 2015, and was obviously unrelated to any incidents involving obese teachers and young students in Iowa. We were unable to identify the image purportedly depicting \"Kensington elementary school psychiatrist Ashley Simmons.\"", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
