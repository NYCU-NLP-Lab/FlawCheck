["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on May 24, 2019", "A doctored video of an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi portrays her speech as being slowed and slurred, and has been used to advance a false claim that she was \u201cdrunk.\u201d", "Within hours of her interview at the Center for American Progress Ideas Conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the target of an online deception that purported to show she was \u201cdrunk.\u201d", "The manipulated video clip, which was\u00a0posted\u00a0May 22, shows the California Democrat talking about President Donald Trump at the conference. But it was more tightly cropped than the original video and edited to slow Pelosi\u2019s speech, making it appear that she was\u00a0slurring her words.", "Tens of thousands of Facebook users shared the distorted clip, which received more than 2 million views. Many users spread the video by\u00a0posting\u00a0comments advancing the false claim that she was \u201cdrunk\u201d \u2014 mirroring a claim made in the caption of a YouTube version\u00a0of the video, which was widely shared before being removed by the platform.", "The same portion of Pelosi\u2019s full exchange with Neera Tanden, CAP\u2019s president, makes clear to viewers that the viral version was doctored. In fact, the 3-minute and 7-second doctored version adds more than 40 seconds to the same section of the interview\u00a0as seen on C-SPAN and CAP\u2019s YouTube channel.", "Maura Shea, an associate teaching professor of film-video and media studies at Penn State, said in an interview that the length added to the version on Facebook, as opposed to the one on C-SPAN, is one sign of its manipulated nature: \u201cTime is time.\u201d", "The sound, too, of the Facebook copy shows signs of editing \u2014 notably a \u201ctin can or a swirling sound in the background\u201d that\u2019s especially apparent in the moments when Pelosi is not talking, Shea said.", "\u201cIt can happen when you digitally slow something down and you don\u2019t want the pitch to change,\u201d Shea said. \u201cWhich is normally what would happen with a slowed down clip.\u201d", "She added:\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re making frames that don\u2019t exist so they don\u2019t sound perfectly clean.\u201d", "A spokesman for Pelosi told FactCheck.org that Pelosi does not drink \u2014 something we were also told by staff in 2010 \u2014 and noted that Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani shared the video on Twitter before deleting it. Giuliani seemingly referred to the video again on Twitter Friday, calling it a \u201ccaricature exaggerating her already halting speech pattern.\u201d", "Pelosi and Trump have exchanged jabs following the president\u2019s walkout from a planned infrastructure meeting on May 22.", "A day later, Trump shared a Fox Business segment that was critical of Pelosi\u2019s speaking during a press conference that day. \u201cPELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE,\u201d\u00a0he wrote. That video does not appear to be distorted, but instead uses selective clips of her full exchange with reporters.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Giuliani, Rudy (@RudyGiuliani). \u201cNancy Pelosi wants an apology for a caricature exaggerating her already halting speech pattern.
