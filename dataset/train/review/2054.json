The report cited a similar story from the New American, a bimonthly magazine for \"freedom-loving Americans\" who support \"limited government under the Constitution,\" according to its about page.", "Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook\u2019s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "This is not the first time we have encountered falsehoods concerning\u00a0the U.N. and gun control. We previously looked at the claim that a U.N. treaty would mandate a \"new international gun registry\" and\u00a0a chain email\u00a0that wrongly accused the Obama administration of planning to use international treaties to ban all weapons.", "As with these past statements, there is also\u00a0a lot wrong with this new report about the U.N. conference.", "The report said U.S. representatives attending the Third Review Conference for the June 2018 U.N. Program of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons agreed \"to begin developing \u2018legal frameworks\u2019 \u2026 that will enforce \u2018proper management\u2019 of \u2018small arms and light weapons\u2019\u00a0stockpiles.\"", "The report went on to say, misleadingly, that the United States pledged to help the U.N. track and confiscate firearms, including stockpiles owned by private citizens.", "\"In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people,\" the story said. \"If they don\u2019t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the U.N. will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not. This agreement is wildly unconstitutional.\"", "Citing six points spelled out in the \"implementation at the national level\" section of the conference\u2019s outcome document, the story said the meeting resulted in the United States\u2019 willing violation of Second and Tenth Amendment rights.", "But the story erred in its understanding of the conference. In reality, the conference provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons.", "According to the website for the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs, the original meeting in 2001 saw governments agree \"to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management \u2014 and to engage in cooperation and assistance.\"", "Nikki Haley, the U.S.\u00a0Ambassador to the U.N., attended this year's conference along with several advisers, according to\u00a0the U.N.'s list of participants.
