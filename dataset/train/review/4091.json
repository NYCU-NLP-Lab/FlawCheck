We asked her for evidence but did not hear back. What we found is that her statement is at odds with doctors, who say the data, in fact, reflects an undercount.", "Here\u2019s why the details of death reporting back up the doctors more than the pundits.", "Owens is wrong that only medical examiners determine a person\u2019s cause of death. Formal death certificates start with the attending doctor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells physicians to list the immediate cause of death, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, and then proceed to the underlying disease that caused the heart or breathing to stop.", "The underlying cause should be \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.\"", "If a person showed up in the emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms and a heart attack, there could be a judgement call as to what goes in as the underlying cause.

When a person with the virus dies, hospitals or nursing homes tell their local health officials who then notify the state health department, which in turn sends a report to Washington.", "Providers in New York use this form to record the death, and unlike a full death certificate, it provides just one place to note the disease.", "This quick reporting form lacks the details that go into a death certificate. Like seasonal flu, COVID-19 is what is known as a nationally notifiable disease. Heart attacks and strokes fall into the larger group of diseases that are not tracked in real time.
