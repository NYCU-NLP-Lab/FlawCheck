So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it.

So, we\u2019ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That\u2019s pretty powerful.\"", "Later, Trump clarified his comments after a reporter asked Bryan whether disinfectants could actually be injected into COVID-19 patients.", "\"It wouldn\u2019t be through injections, almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area.
