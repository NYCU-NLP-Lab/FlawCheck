Ted Strickland's re-election campaign hasn't wavered from the message that his Republican opponent, John Kasich, cost Ohio jobs when he was a congressman by supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement and overseas trade deals, especially with China.\n\nA Strickland TV ad, \"Truth,\" sticks to the theme with claims that have been posted on the campaign's website:\n\n\"Kasich\u2019s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China.\"\n\nThe ad says voting for NAFTA, which took effect in 1994 and eliminated most trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States, cost the state 49,000 jobs to Mexico. It says 91,000 Ohio jobs were lost to China because of Kasich\u2019s vote in 2000 to normalize trade relations with China.\n\nWe wondered if the effect of the trade deals on jobs was so clear-cut - and if the numbers can be determined so specifically.\n\nCalculating job losses and gains is not a simple matter of counting heads.\n\nThe ad's estimate of job losses tied to NAFTA comes from a 2006 study by the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-union think tank that has long been critical of NAFTA. The study did not, however, claim to count actual job losses. Extrapolating from employment, census and trade data, it estimated how many jobs might have been supported by production that the study says was \"displaced\" by growing U.S. trade deficits with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThere are other complications.\n\nThe nonpartisan General Accounting Office said that job losses were overestimated, because some NAFTA imports displaced imports from other countries instead of production in the U.S.\n\nBoth the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service concluded that factors other than NAFTA caused the widening trade deficit with Mexico. And the Congressional Research Service, evaluating studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the World Bank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the U.S. International Trade Commission, found that none attributed changes in employment levels to NAFTA.\n\nThe estimate of jobs lost to China carries virtually identical problems. The figure also comes from EPI, through a study published this year. It also is based on \"displaced production\" resulting from trade imbalance, and not on a tally of actual job losses.\n\nFurther clouding the estimate is the effect that other economic policies and forces - including product dumping, price controls and currency manipulation - have on the trade imbalance. The effect of normalized trade relations cannot be isolated.\n\nKasich did vote for NAFTA in the House of Representatives in 1993 and for normalizing trade relations with China in 2000. Labeling them as \"Kasich\u2019s trade deals,\" as does the ad, is a stretch, though.\n\nThe Clinton administration supported NAFTA, and 102 Democrats joined Republicans voting for the agreement, which the House approved 234 to 200. Clinton also fought for the Chinese trade bill, which the House passed with 164 Republican and 73 Democratic votes.\n\nStrickland, who was also in Congress, voted against both measures.\n\nSo in the end, here\u2019s what we\u2019re left with:", "We rate Strickland's claim as False.", "Comment on this item.", "Gov.
