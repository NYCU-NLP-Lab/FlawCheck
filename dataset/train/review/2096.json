Your press briefings have been town halls, people venting their anger, wondering where you were early on. I know you issued statements after about 72 hours, but you didn't come to the scene for five days. What responsibility do you bear?", "Nixon replied: \"Well, I mean, I've been here almost every day.\"", "We decided to review Nixon\u2019s timeline for the last 9 days.", "Michael Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson around noon on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Mo., and was pronounced dead at the scene.

When questioning Nixon, Raddatz quizzed him on why he \"didn't come to the scene for five days.\"", "The church\u00a0event wasn\u2019t held at the scene. Nor was it in the same locality.
