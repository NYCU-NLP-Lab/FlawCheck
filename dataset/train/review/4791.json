Several of the social media posts and blog headlines called the community \u201cignorant\u201d for eating the fish.", "Some of the photos in the social media posts feature a man in a yellow t-shirt, which led certain social media users to claim that he is the fisherman who caught the fish. However, this is false. The man, named Zion Godwin, said he was visiting a relative in a fishing settlement in the Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria when the fish was caught, but he was not the fisherman.", "\u201cActually, when the man brought the fish all the people there could not give the name of the fish.
