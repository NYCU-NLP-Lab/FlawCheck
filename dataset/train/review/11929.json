Mayor Bill Foster, who pushed for the cameras, still supports them.", "Mayoral candidate Rick Kriseman aligns with Foster. \"I support them for the purposes of public safety, not as a revenue generator. ... The fact is that red light cameras change driver behavior and cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents,\" Kriseman wrote.", "We wanted to know if Kriseman\u2019s point is accurate.", "St. Petersburg\u2019s program", "The cameras seem to be just about everywhere.", "St. Petersburg is one of about 70 municipalities in Florida with red light cameras, along with five other cities in Pinellas County, Tampa, Miami, Clearwater and Orlando. About half of U.S. states have authorized the technology in the past two decades.", "The St. Petersburg program started in fall 2011 with cameras at 10 intersections. Tickets for running a red light are $158. (Locations here.) Already the cameras have been at the brink of wipeout, having survived a few City Council votes that would effectively end the program.", "A number of municipalities have had buyer\u2019s remorse. In Houston, a voter referendum killed the program. Collier County (Fla.) commissioners voted to kill their program in December 2012 because they did not find evidence that the cameras reduced accidents. Los Angeles officials ended the program there after realizing it was difficult to pursue violators who ignored their tickets. An audit found the cameras did not improve public safety.", "Still, other cities tout benefits. More than a year in, the question remains for St. Pete: Are the cameras reducing the most dangerous crashes?", "A consultant\u2019s performance report in December 2012 concluded that the red light crash rate\u00a0fell by 31\u00a0percent at St. Petersburg traffic approaches with cameras from November 2011 to October 2012, compared to the three-year average preceding it. Crashes from red light running resulting in injury fell by 47 percent compared to the three-year average preceding the program, the consultants found.", "But the lengthy report omitted facts later reported by the Tampa Bay Times, such as the fact that rear-end wrecks at intersections with red light cameras jumped 44 percent and overall crashes at those intersections increased 10 percent compared to the previous year.", "Interpretations all depend on how you dice the data, said Michael Frederick, the city\u2019s transportation manager. The consultant compared the first year of traffic data with a three-year average instead of data just for the year before.\u00a0A more in-depth review is expected after three years with the cameras, he said.", "Not included in the report? Fatal crashes. Frederick said that\u2019s because there were none in the year examined.

The institute also points to a 2002 study in California, showing significant declines in injury crashes and right-angle injury crashes across the city after some intersections got cameras.", "\u2022 The Journal of Trauma study examined driver behavior for nine months at a dangerous intersection in a New Orleans suburb. The report concluded the cameras decreased the rate of red-light running and had a \"lasting effect on driver behavior.\" The study, however, said the cameras did not seem to prevent collisions at the intersection, recommending more studies over more time.", "\u2022 The Texas Transportation Institute of Texas A&M University examined crash records at 275 intersections in Texas cities with red light cameras.
