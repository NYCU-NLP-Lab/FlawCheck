["Facebook posts which have\u00a0racked up thousands of \u2018likes\u2019 invite entrepreneurs to apply for a grant from Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. But a ministry spokesman told AFP that \u201cscammers\u201d were behind the posts, which were published by a fake account.", "The posts, which we\u2019ve archived here and here, were published on a Facebook account called \u2018Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Uganda\u2019. They claim to be offering $31.4 million worth of grants to \u2018all deserving entrepreneurs and farmers\u2019 in Uganda as part of a ministry scheme in partnership with the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a Washington-based organisation which helps fund environmental projects.", "The posts contain a link asking applicants to fill in their personal details.", "Fake account", "However, the Facebook page is fake and designed to look like the finance ministry\u2019s official Facebook page. Below are two screenshots, showing the fake page (left) and\u00a0the Ugandan finance ministry's official page (right), which we found by following a link on the ministry\u2019s website.", "Although the two pages look almost identical, a few simple clues help to distinguish the official page from the fake. Firstly, the ministry\u2019s genuine Facebook page has thousands more likes than the fake one. We can also use Facebook\u2019s \u2018Page transparency\u2019 tab, which you can access on the pages\u2019 timelines, to find out when the pages were created and who manages them.", "Below is a screenshot showing details of the fake Facebook page (left), which reveal it was created on September 19, 2019 and is managed in Kenya. On the right, transparency information for the ministry\u2019s actual Facebook page says it was created on October 12, 2011 -- years before the fake page -- and is managed in Uganda.", "It seems Uganda\u2019s finance ministry is well aware of people pretending to represent it. On its website, the ministry has published a warning that it \u2018has no grant funding programm (sic) for small and medium entreprises\u2019.", "\u2018Scammers\u2019", "Contacted by AFP, finance ministry spokesman Jimmy Mugunga said \u201c\u2018scammers\u201d were behind the false reports.", "\"It's been more than a year since this started but it has persisted. It's not correct. We have issued a warning about it,\" he told us by phone.", "He said that if the ministry was setting up a grant programme, it would publish statements and press releases rather than a Facebook post.", "\u2018No such initiative\u2019", "The fake posts claim that Uganda\u2019s finance ministry has \u2018partnered\u2019 with the World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF) to offer the grants. However, the World Bank confirmed it had no involvement in any such project.", "\u201cI can confirm that we have no such initiative running in Uganda,\u201d a World Bank spokesperson in Uganda told AFP by email. \u201cIt is a fake website and the Ministry of Finance has already alerted the authorities about the fraudulent Facebook page.\u201d", "We have reached out to the GEF for a comment and will update this post with any further information.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
