In the popular mind, it\u2019s a measure of how well the nation competes in the world and whether \"we still make things.\"", "So during a speech in Arizona, when President Barack Obama was listing the ways the economy has recovered, he made a point to include American exports.", "\"We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before,\" Obama said.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the president specifically referred to \"products made in America\" in contrast to a broader view on trade that blends both goods and services. The data check on Obama\u2019s claim is straightforward.", "When tallying sales of everything from bushels of wheat to jet engines, the standard unit of measurement is dollars. The Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Commerce Department helps pull together the country\u2019s trade statistics. The bureau\u2019s June report showed the U.S. exported more than $134 billion worth of goods that month. That indeed is the largest dollar amount ever, even accounting for inflation. There are two important pieces of context for these numbers -- the impact of the recession and the overall trade deficit.

By 2011, sales were higher than just before the recession hit and they\u2019ve continued to rise.", "But the rate of increase has slowed considerably. Andrew Bernard, a trade economist at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business, runs the numbers a little differently but sees the same trend.
