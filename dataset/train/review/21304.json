["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on June 14, 2017", "President Donald Trump and his top environmental official said the Paris Agreement would reduce the global average temperature by only 0.2 degrees Celsius. Former Vice President Al Gore said that\u2019s \u201cnot true.\u201d Who\u2019s right?", "Trump and Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, are correct that one report did estimate a 0.2 C reduction. But the report\u2019s author said the Trump administration \u201ccherry-picked\u201d that figure.", "Other\u00a0studies have shown greater reductions. Estimates differ because researchers make different assumptions at the onset of their calculations, such as whether countries will make more ambitious pledges to reduce carbon emissions in the future.", "Trump made his claim about the agreement\u2019s effect on global warming during a June 1 speech\u00a0announcing\u00a0that the U.S. would \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the international deal.", "The agreement, which went into effect Nov. 4, 2016, primarily aims to keep warming \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d and to pursue \u201cefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\u201d The planet has warmed nearly 1 C already, according to NASA.", "Trump, June 1: Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree \u2014 think of that; this much \u2014 Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.", "A day after the president\u2019s announcement, Pruitt said \u201ceven if all of the targets were met by all nations across the globe, it only reduced the temperature by less than two-tenths of one degree.\u201d", "Gore, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for increasing public knowledge about climate change, was asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on June 4 about the statements made by Trump and Pruitt.", "\u201cWell, first of all, it\u2019s not true,\u201d Gore said, adding that the Paris Agreement \u201cgives tremendous momentum\u201d to reducing global warming.", "We reached out to spokespeople for Gore, Trump and Pruitt for support for their claims. Gore\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond. The White House also didn\u2019t respond, but in a video posted to Facebook on June 1, it\u00a0cites research out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to support the claim that \u201cif every member nation met all of their commitments [under the Paris Agreement] through this century, the impact on the climate would be negligible.\u201d EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman also pointed us to the\u00a02015 MIT report.", "Under the Paris Agreement,\u00a0countries submit pledges\u00a0that outline their emissions targets and other aims related to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Countries must submit new pledges every five years. These pledges should grow more ambitious over time, the agreement stipulates, although the targets are voluntary and there are no penalties for failing to meet them.", "The MIT report looked at\u00a0the effect that the majority of the first set of pledges would have\u00a0on warming\u00a0by 2100. In their report, the MIT researchers assumed\u00a0countries wouldn\u2019t make additional, more ambitious pledges.", "\u201cAssuming the proposed cuts [under the Paris Agreement] are extended through 2100 but not deepened further, they result in about 0.2\u00b0C less warming by the end of the century,\u201d the report said.", "To come up with that estimate, the researchers compared the bulk of the Paris pledges\u2019 impact on warming with the impact of\u00a0emissions targets\u00a0set\u00a0under climate\u00a0agreements made in\u00a0Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancun in 2010. As we\u2019ll explain below, other studies that found larger reductions compared the Paris pledges with other baselines, such as climate policies in place since 2005.", "On June 8,\u00a0John Reilly, the co-director of MIT\u2019s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change and co-author of the 2015 report,\u00a0published an op-ed in the Washington Post, in which he argued that the Trump \u201cadministration cherry-picked [his]\u00a0group\u2019s findings to help make their case.\u201d", "The Paris Agreement\u00a0builds on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u00a0and\u00a0was signed\u00a0by all but two of the 197 countries party to the convention.\u00a0Reilly argues it\u2019s the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of all commitments made\u00a0under this\u00a0framework that\u2019s the \u201crelevant number, not 0.2 degrees.\u201d The 0.2 C figure, in other words, \u201creflects only the incremental effect of Paris when built upon all the previous commitments made through the UNFCCC.\u201d", "The 0.2 C estimate also\u00a0doesn\u2019t take into consideration the full potential effect of the Paris Agreement alone. In calculating\u00a0the\u00a00.2 C figure, Reilly and his colleagues\u00a0\u201cassumed no further strengthening of national commitments in years after 2030,\u201d which is another \u201ccritically important\u201d distinction, he says.", "Bowman at the EPA also cited a 2015 paper by\u00a0Bjorn Lomborg, the president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center\u00a0in Denmark. Lomborg authored the 2001 book \u201cThe Skeptical Environmentalist,\u201d in which he writes that global warming is \u201ctaking place,\u201d but that cutting back fossil fuels will create\u00a0greater problems for\u00a0the world than global warming.\u00a0Other scientists have criticized Lomborg\u2019s book.", "Published in the journal Global Policy in November 2015, Lomborg\u2019s study compared warming under a business-as-usual scenario to warming with the Paris pledges. He concluded that the difference is about 0.17 C in 2100.", "Unlike the MIT report\u00a0and Lomborg\u2019s paper,\u00a0other studies that found greater reductions did assume countries would make more ambitious pledges in the future, as the agreement\u00a0specifies.", "So what is the \u201crelevant number,\u201d as Reilly put it?", "The MIT researcher\u00a0points to one analysis by the climate modeling nonprofit Climate Interactive\u00a0that found that national contributions made by\u00a0UNFCCC parties to date, which include the Paris Agreement pledges, would result in roughly 3.3 C of warming above\u00a0pre-industrial levels by 2100. That\u2019s compared with 4.2 C of warming for business as usual, a 0.9 C difference.", "Roughly 1 degree \u201cmight not sound like a lot,\u201d explains Reilly, but it\u2019s actually the amount of warming that the planet\u00a0\u201chas experienced in roughly the past century and a half, and in that time we\u2019ve observed retreating mountain glaciers, rising sea levels and other significant impacts.\u201d", "Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, a climate physicist at Climate Analytics, a nonprofit climate science and policy institute in Germany, also put the\u00a00.2 C figure into context for us. He said\u00a0it\u2019s subjective whether or not something is \u201ctiny.\u201d\u00a0Still,\u00a0\u201cA few systems are particularly sensitive to also small warming increments,\u201d Schleussner told us by email. These systems include tropical coral reef bleaching, \u201cfor which every tenth of a degree matters,\u201d and Arctic sea-ice melting, he added.", "Another analysis by Joeri Rogelj, an energy modeling and climate policy expert at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, and others took a more nuanced approach to estimating the impact of the Paris Agreement on climate change.", "Published in the journal Nature in June 2016, Rogelj\u2019s study looks at four\u00a0scenarios that each make different assumptions about global effort to reduce warming by 2100:", "The researchers also took into consideration three different probabilities for the four different scenarios. For example, they\u00a0estimated there\u2019s\u00a0a 90 percent probability warming would be around\u00a03.7 C under scenario four. They also estimated warming under this scenario would be limited to 2.7 C, but\u00a0only with a 50 percent probability.", "The researchers note that UNFCCC policymakers have been satisfied with a 66 percent probability when discussing\u00a0policies to keep warming below 2 C. Under this probability level, total warming ranges from 3 C for scenario four to\u00a04.5 C for scenario one. But what about the reductions due to the Paris Agreement pledges specifically?", "When comparing the level of warming for all\u00a0Paris Agreement pledges, regardless of financial aid conditions (scenario four), with all climate policies\u00a0excluding the Paris Agreement (scenario two), the difference is 0.6 C, more than the MIT researchers\u2019 estimate of 0.2 C.", "Why did Rogelj\u2019s study find a larger reduction?", "Unlike the MIT researchers, Rogelj and his group assumed pledges would continue to become progressively more ambitious over time because, \u201c[s]talling climate action after 2030 would be in contradiction with the provisions of the Paris Agreement,\u201d the researchers write.", "Still, in their review of the scientific literature, the researchers found that studies came to \u201ca wide range of estimates of future emissions under nominally similar scenarios.\u201d How much greenhouse gas emissions are put into the atmosphere directly relates to how much the planet will warm, so if researchers have different estimates of emissions, they will also have different estimates for warming.", "For example,\u00a0countries didn\u2019t submit their pledges under the Paris Agreement all in the same format. Some provided their emissions targets in an absolute format, such as a percentage reduction compared with\u00a0some\u00a0baseline. Other countries provided targets in terms of \u201cemissions intensity,\u201d which is a ratio of emissions to economic output. Some\u00a0countries provided no specific emissions target at all and instead pledged to increase their share of renewable energy or cut their use of fossil fuels.", "Researchers have to translate\u00a0all of these different quantities\u00a0into an absolute emissions format in order to come up with an estimate for total warming. And they might not\u00a0all make these conversions in the same way. Hence, they come to different estimates for warming.", "In short, the assumptions researchers make when calculating\u00a0global average temperature reductions due to the Paris Agreement influence their final estimates. There are a range of estimates that make different assumptions, and 0.2 C is one of those estimates.", "So, while\u00a0Trump is right about the estimate from\u00a0one particular study, a co-author of that report says a more \u201crelevant\u201d estimate of the Paris Agreement\u2019s impact on warming is\u00a0closer to 1 C. That researcher also disputed the Trump administration\u2019s characterization of the total reduction as \u201cnegligible.\u201d", "Even if 0.2 C was the relevant figure, it\u2019s not a negligible quantity when it comes to\u00a0tropical coral reef bleaching or Arctic sea ice melting.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
