He was campaign manager when Obama won the presidency in 2008 and followed Obama to Washington to serve as White House senior advisor. He left the administration in 2011 to become senior strategist for Obama\u2019s successful 2012 re-election campaign.", "Deal is hardly the first candidate in this year\u2019s elections to try to link an opponent to Obama, who has a low 42-percent job approval rating nationally, worse in Georgia.", "In the state\u2019s GOP Senate race, for example, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston tried to tar opponent David Perdue by pointing out that a company with Perdue on its board of directors had accepted money from Obama\u2019s stimulus program. Perdue, meanwhile, attacked Kingston for voting to put money into president\u2019s Cash for Clunkers program.", "But in this case, Deal got it wrong.", "Axelrod isn\u2019t working on Carter\u2019s campaign.

Deal will do anything he can to distract from his ethical quagmire, including lie about his opponent,\" Thomas said. \"It's not surprising that a governor who plays it so loose with the laws is playing loose with truth, too.\"", "Earlier this month, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained a memo in which Holly LaBerge, head of the state ethics commission, said she was threatened and pressured by Deal\u2019s office in 2012 to \"make (ethics) complaints\" against the governor \"go away.\"", "The complaints included claims Deal improperly paid for use of a private aircraft for campaign travel and questioned his use of campaign funds to pay legal fees during his 2010 campaign.", "The ethics commission wound up dismissing the major complaints against Deal.
