["About this rating", "In April 2019, we started receiving queries about a viral piece of text entitled \"Thoughts from a hipster coffee shop ...\" supposedly written by a young woman named Alyssa Ahlgren. The post outlined some thoughts on poverty in the United States, millennials' alleged sense of entitlement, and the popularity of socialist policies among her generation.", "The article, which included a photograph of the author, was widely shared on Facebook.

And, by a millennial. Bravo!", "By Golly, finally one who gets it. So well said, maybe there is hope for our grandchildren's generation after all. This is one of the most well written pieces that I have seen, written by a young lady in a coffee shop to her fellow millennials.", "The \"Thoughts from a hipster coffee shop ...\" opinion piece was truly written by Ahlgren. The article was originally published on 6 April 2019 on the website Alphanewsmn, where Ahlgren is a regular contributor. Ahlgren has also been published by the Daily Caller and is an ambassador for the conservative organization Turning Point USA.", "Here's a video of Ahlgren discussing \"socialism on the rise\" during an April 2019 appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News television show:", "Ahlgren, Alyssa. \u00a0 \"Thoughts from a Hipster Coffee Shop ...\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Alpha News. \u00a0 6 April 2019.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
