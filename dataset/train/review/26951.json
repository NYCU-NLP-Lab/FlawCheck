["About this rating", "In April 2016, the issue of transgender bathroom usage\u00a0dominated news and social media, mostly due to the passage of HB2 in North Carolina and Target's policy allowing people to use bathrooms that best match their gender identity.\u00a0 Among those making headlines were lawmakers in the city of Oxford, Alabama.", "In late March 2016, lawmakers in North Carolina passed the sweeping\u00a0HB2\u00a0(also known as the \"bathroom bill\"),\u00a0which nullified\u00a0a Charlotte ordinance affording protections to gay and transgender residents. The controversial legislation immediately became a matter of national discussion, and fallout extended well across the United States. On 19 April 2016, retailer Target responded to the law by instituting a policy allowing transgender employees and customers to use the restroom that best matched their gender identity, and a Kroger location in Georgia posted a sign to put transgender shoppers at ease.", "On 27 April 2016, the national debate took another turn when a city in Alabama responded to Target's policy:", "#CallItOut: Oxford Alabama City Council approves horrific and unprecedented anti-transgender law https://t.co/QNMow4Lg7e via @HRC", "\u2014 HumanRightsCampaign (@HRC) April 27, 2016", "The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0reported that\u00a0Oxford's ordinance prohibits individuals from using bathrooms that do not\u00a0correspond to\u00a0the gender listed on their birth certificates.

There is a Target store in the Oxford Exchange shopping center ... The Oxford ordinance makes it a misdemeanor for a person to use a restroom that doesn't correspond with their gender at birth. Violators of the ordinance could face a $500 fine or up to six months in jail.", "Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge said the law will be enforced like any other city ordinance, such as noise violations or public indecency.", "\"If somebody sees something that makes them uncomfortable, they would call the police,\" he was quoted by Al.com as saying. \"If the person is still there when the officer arrives, the officer has to witness the crime. Then we take down the person's information, and the person who reported it has to sign out a warrant.\"", "The Anniston Star reported that the ordinance was passed on 26 April 2016, and its provisions apply within the city's jurisdiction. Oxford's council president said the measure was enacted in response to a large number\u00a0of complaints about Target's policy:", "The new law, approved unanimously by the council\u2019s members, restricts a person\u2019s use of public bathrooms and changing rooms to the facilities designated for use by those of the gender listed on his or her birth certificate.

Waits said he\u2019s received an \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of complaints from city residents regarding the company\u2019s policy since it was announced.", "Under the new law, alleged violations must be reported by a witness or committed in front of a police officer to be prosecutable ... Those found to have violated the law would be fined $500, or sentenced to six months in jail.", "Waits spoke about the ordinance on 27 April 2016:", "In the 27 April 2016 video, Waits maintained that Oxford's new bathroom ordinance was passed \"not out of concerns for the 0.3 percent of the population who identify as transgender,\" but to protect women and children from predators and deviants. Critics of the law objected to the latter remarks, noting that sexual misconduct is\u00a0already illegal (in bathrooms and elsewhere) under existing laws.", "Gordon, Michael et al. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"North Carolina\u2019s Newest Law Solidifies State\u2019s Role in Defining Discrimination.\"\r\nCharlotte Observer. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 26 March 2016.", "Thornton, William. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Oxford Passes Transgender Bathroom Ordinance With Threat Of $500 Fine, 6 Months In Jail.\"\r\nAL.com. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 26 April 2016.", "Tyler, Zach. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Oxford Council Rebukes Target Bathroom Policy With New Ordinance.\"\r\nThe Anniston Star. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 27 April 2016.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Alabama City Passes Transgender Bathroom Ordinance.\"\r\n27 April 2016.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
