["An altered photo is making its rounds on social media, claiming to show Democratic U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan wearing dresses adorned with stars that form the shape of a swastika, the\u00a0Nazi symbol.", "Also in the photo are three other Democratic representatives:\u00a0Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, to whose head\u00a0a red bow was added, and congressional newcomers\u00a0Cori Bush of Missouri and\u00a0Jamaal Bowman of New York, whose face masks were altered to display\u00a0the swastika-like graphic imposed on Omar, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez's dresses.", "\"Look at rashida , omar and aoc dress , there is a swastika !\" the text below the photo reads. USA TODAY has reached out to the user who posted the image.", "Omar was criticized in 2018 and 2019 for what commentators said was using an anti-Semitic trope in a tweet criticizing Israel's policies. She\u00a0later apologized but\u00a0has remained a target of criticism.", "A reverse Google image search shows the original photo was posted Jan. 3 to Bush's Twitter account with the words \"Squad Up.\"\u00a0There are no swastikas in that photo, nor the bow. It also shows Ilhan,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez and\u00a0Tlaib wearing different-colored dresses than the ones they appear to have on in the altered photo.", "\"The Squad\" is a term used to describe the young, liberal\u00a0group of women of color who often have been\u00a0targets of former President Donald Trump and other conservatives. News website The Hill\u00a0said Bush's posting of the photo indicates she and Bowman are its newest members.", "Since the image with the swastikas showed up in\u00a0early January, independent fact-checkers have shown the image to be altered. Still, it has been shared hundreds of times.", "The image is ALTERED, based on our research. The original photo was posted to Twitter by freshman Rep. Cori Bush in January.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
