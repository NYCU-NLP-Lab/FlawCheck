["Angela Merkel, Theresa May and the Lithuanian President were pictured together at a party in their youth.", "False.", "This image claims to show Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 together in their youth. We are confident that it does not.", "The image does indeed show Angela Merkel in her youth on the left, but the false caption says the woman in the middle is Mrs May, and the woman on the right is Mrs Grybauskait\u0117.", "This claim seems to go viral every now and again, and was covered by the factchecking organisation Snopes back in March 2018.", "So how do we know the image doesn\u2019t show an extraordinary early meeting of three European leaders?", "Primarily, because the woman in the middle looks nothing like Mrs May. The image of Mrs Merkel and her friends is reportedly from New Year\u2019s Eve 1972. There is at least one image of Mrs May at school in 1971, as well as other photos of her in her teenage years: they bear little resemblance to the woman in this photograph. (They do very clearly look like a young Theresa May.)", "We haven\u2019t found a verified picture of Mrs Grybauskait\u0117 from a similar time period. But the Lithuanian Embassy in London told us that the woman on the right is not Mrs Grybauskait\u0117.", "Even without that confirmation, the evidence suggests it\u2019s not Mrs Grybauskait\u0117. Consider how similar Mrs May looks nowadays to how she looked in 1971, and how similar Mrs Merkel looks today to how she looks in 1972. But Mrs Grybauskait\u0117 as an adult does not look like the teenager in this photograph.", "Given the evidence, we\u2019re confident that Mrs Grybauskait\u0117 and Mrs May did not travel from Lithuania and the UK to East Berlin in 1972 to ring in the new year with Angela Merkel.", "This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.
