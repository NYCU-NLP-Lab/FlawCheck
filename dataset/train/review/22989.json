["By Sydney Nixon", "Posted on July 1, 2020", "A Christian blogger writing for The Daily Jot accused former President Barack Obama in 2017 of running a \u201cshadow government.\u201d The blog post has been recirculating lately on social media, but it is falsely attributed to the late Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer.", "After a period of relative silence since leaving office in January 2017, former President Barack Obama returned to the political stage in mid-April to\u00a0endorse\u00a0his former vice president, Joe Biden, in the 2020 presidential election. Then, on May 8, during a call with former members of his administration, Obama publicly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s response to COVID-19 as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster.\u201d", "Now, a viral post, shared widely on Facebook, is claiming that Obama \u2014 through Organizing for Action, the nonprofit established during his second term \u2014 is \u201cworking to disrupt everything that our current president\u2019s administration is trying to do.\u201d", "The post attributes the claims to conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer.", "But Krauthammer, who died in 2018, did not write the article and Organizing for Action no longer exists.", "The same attribution was debunked by Snopes in 2017, but has resurfaced since Obama has taken an active role in the presidential election.", "The false attribution of the article apparently began when the website Nesara-Republic Now-Galactic News published a piece titled \u201cThe Enemy Amongst Us!!\u201d on Oct. 11, 2017.
