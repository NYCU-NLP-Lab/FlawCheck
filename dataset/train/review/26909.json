The latest estimate from the U.S. Agriculture Department says parents shell out over $240,000 for the average child by the time he or she is 18. For many families, that can be tough to manage, but a tweet from the advocacy group Moms Rising says the consequences can be very dire indeed.", "\"Having a baby is a\u00a0leading cause of poverty spells in the United States,\" the group tweeted on Aug. 5, 2014. Moms Rising supports paid family leave and boasts a membership of more than 1 million people.", "For proof, the group points to a 2012 article in The Nation that said, \"a quarter of all \u2018poverty spells\u2019\u2014 falling into poverty for two months or more at a time \u2014 begin with the birth of a child.\" The article did not cast the birth of a child as a leading reason a person would slip into poverty, but it did link to a 2001 report by Jane Waldvogel, a professor of social work and public affairs at Columbia University.", "Waldvogel\u2019s language was a bit more cautious than what appeared in The Nation.", "\"Recent estimates suggest that one quarter of all poverty spells in the United States begin with the birth of a new child,\" Waldvogel wrote.", "Waldvogel based that on 1998 data from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.

When we add up the percentages tied to the arrival of a new baby, we see the source of the 28 percent cited by Waldvogel.

In other words, one person could experience both the birth of a child and a loss of work hours or some other event.", "She did note that the 1986-91 period was unusual because no full recession took place in those years. Stevens said in good times, giving birth would play a bigger role as a poverty trigger because the other leading trigger, job loss, would be less common when the economy is doing well.", "A 2014 report from the Health and Human Services Department reaffirms the primacy of a job. The target group is different, single mothers who start receiving welfare payments, but the pattern is consistent with the 1998 table.

The evidence cited by Moms Rising goes back to 1998 and while one might say that having a child can trigger a spell of poverty about a quarter of the time, the impact of job loss is much greater.", "The most careful analysis separated the relative influence of different life changes.
