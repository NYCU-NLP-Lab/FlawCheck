["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on September 17, 2020 | Updated on September 17, 2020", "Social media posts are using an image of a CBS News report to accuse the network of misrepresenting a campaign event for President Donald Trump as one for former Vice President Joe Biden. That\u2019s false. The report\u2019s voiceover was discussing the Trump campaign while the photo was on the screen.", "A viral claim on Facebook and Twitter is accusing CBS News of being \u201cFake News Media,\u201d but it\u2019s the social media posts \u2014 not CBS \u2014 spreading misinformation.", "On Sept. 16, Jonathan Gilliam, a former Navy SEAL and supporter of President Donald Trump, shared an image on Twitter of a CBS News report whose chyron reads: \u201cBiden Pitches Crucial Latino Voters During Florida Campaign Stop.\u201d A photo in the report shows a crowd of Trump supporters, not his election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.", "Gilliam wrote: \u201cI\u2019m 100% positive I was in Arizona on Monday supporting @realDonaldTrump with #LatinosForTrump despite @CBS claiming I was at a @JoeBiden rally in Florida. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb#FakeNewsMedia\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb\u201d", "His tweet was shared nearly 14,000 times. The claim made its way to Facebook, too, where a user pointed out obvious signs that the photo was from a Trump event \u2014 including hats and signs \u2014 and suggested the network was misleading viewers with its chyron.", "But while the image of the CBS News report is authentic, the report did not suggest it was from a Biden rally. The CBS News reporter was discussing the Trump campaign when the photo was used.", "The picture was taken of a Sept. 15 segment on \u201cCBS Evening News with Norah O\u2019Donnell\u201d (seen above). In the report, CBS News political correspondent Ed O\u2019Keefe reported on a Biden campaign stop in Florida and the need for the Democrat to improve support within the Latino community. A recent NBC News/Marist poll showed Trump slightly ahead with Latino voters in the state.", "The report featured Chuck Rocha, identified as a former adviser for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign and the founder of a\u00a0Latino-focused super PAC, who said Biden needs to spend more time courting Latino voters in the state. That\u2019s when the report began discussing the Trump campaign\u2019s strategy toward Latino voters and featured the photo in question.", "\u201cThe president has cut into Biden\u2019s advantage by wooing conservative Latinos with ominous warnings about a Biden presidency,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said in a voiceover as the photo is shown.", "The photo was taken by an Associated Press photographer on Sept. 14 at a \u201cLatinos for Trump Coalition\u201d roundtable event in Arizona, as Gilliam correctly noted.", "The next photo and footage seen in the report also show Trump supporters and the president himself.", "So in short, the viral posts are using a snapshot of a CBS News report out of context to falsely claim that the network was misrepresenting a Trump campaign event as one for Biden. The report itself easily disproves that.", "Update, Sept. 17: After we published this story, Gilliam responded to our request for a comment. In an email, he accused the network of \u201csubtle yet effective persuasion\u201d to make \u201cit look like Biden was packing the room in Florida.\u201d But as we said, the news report was discussing the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts when it showed that image.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
