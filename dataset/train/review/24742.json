That provision requires that employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage to those putting in at least 30 hours a week.", "\"Seventy-seven percent of Georgia's fire departments are volunteer, and it is unfair and unfortunate that those firefighters and the communities they protect are the latest Obamacare victims,\" Brook Hougesen, the committee\u2019s press secretary, said in the statement.", "PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the NRSC had accurately sounded the alarm on yet another problem with the Obamacare rollout.
