As the Washington Post documented after his death, Hawking told the Guardian in 2011 that he did not believe in an afterlife or heaven:", "I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.", "In 2010, he told ABC News: \"One can't prove that God doesn't exist, but science makes God unnecessary.\"", "There is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death, and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016, the last time the two men met. Contrary to the claim, Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff; rather, he travelled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.", "Hawking was a valued member of the academy, having been appointed to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its aims \"fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical and religious values.\" After his death, the academy honored Hawking, tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis.", "il beato Paolo VI che si inginocchia per consegnare la medaglia di Pio XI e Hawking che ringrazia al Papa per la decorazione pic.twitter.com/zVICFDlkaE", "\u2014 Casina Pio IV (@CasinaPioIV) March 15, 2018", "However, notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself.", "Hawking's phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity. For example, after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens \u2014 an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion \u2014 American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer. The book was widely dismissed and fiercely criticized by friends of Hitchens. Before that, there were debunked eleventh-hour \"conversions\" to Christianity by Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, and astronomer Carl Sagan.", "This Facebook post is just another in a litany of fabricated claims about famous non-believers.
