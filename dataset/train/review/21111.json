She went on to say that \"I am committed to making sure that women earn the same pay for the same work.\"", "PolitiFact has heard and examined similar wage gap claims before. We decided to revisit the claim and check any new material available on the subject to see whether Colbert Busch\u2019s claim was correct.", "Colbert Busch made her comments about the wage gap on Equal Pay Day. That day symbolizes how many months after one year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned that same one year.", "In conjunction with Equal Pay Day, the National Partnership for Women and Families released a report examining the pay gap in the states and 50 largest metropolitan areas. For South Carolina, the group found that women in general are paid 76 cents for every dollar paid to men. The report is based on census data of full-time, year-round workers. The NPWF used the study to push for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act to prevent pay discrimination.", "Colbert Busch\u2019s figure is correct, and based on numerous studies that have controlled for factors like education level and time on the job and they still cannot explain the gender wage gap, said Drucilla Barker, a professor of women\u2019s and gender studies at the University of South Carolina. \"Women and men do different kinds of work and in general women\u2019s work pays less than men\u2019s work,\" she said. \"The question then becomes \u2018why?\u2019\"", "Last year, a National Women\u2019s Law Center report provided a state-by-state ranking comparing median earnings for both genders for full-time, year-round workers, regardless of occupation, based on census data.

It has been used widely to support eliminating gender discrimination.", "Last June, in a campaign ad, President Barack Obama claimed that women are \"paid \u00a077 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.\" Obama neglected to include employee factors such as education level, occupation and time on the job in his analysis, and received a Mostly False rating for oversimplifying his statement. A few months later, Colorado legislator Diana DeGette received a Mostly True rating for her claim that women \"receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns\" because she did not use the \"same work as men\" qualifier.", "The 23-cent gap has been challenged by economists and policy groups who say the gap is much smaller when factors such as education, type of job and experience level are considered.", "This week, the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a conservative nonprofit group, posted a video about the gap, calling it inaccurate, and saying that proposed laws to close the perceived gap will lead to undue government regulation.", "In October, a study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls, analyzed men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings one year after graduation.", "Study authors maintain that a wage gap for almost all occupations still exists.

An AAUW researcher noted that the wage gap can grow as careers progress.", "How much of a pay gap between women and men is due to discrimination against women is unclear, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \"But a fair-minded person should certainly take account of hours worked per week before calculating the earnings penalty of being a women.

Each time, we have noted that some studies reporting the larger gaps do not take into account several variables impacting pay, including types of occupations, age of employee, education and training, hours worked and duration on the job.", "That is the case with the claim made by Colbert Busch.", "Making such a blanket statement without the context of the qualifiers is disingenuous.", "There is a wage gap between men and women. She is right about that.", "But most studies indicate it tends to diminish when other factors are considered.
