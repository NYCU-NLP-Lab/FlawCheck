["Chief financial officer Jeff Atwater speaks at a pre-legislative news conference on Jan. 28, 2015, in Tallahassee. (AP photo)", "Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater capitalized on news about the floundering Greek economy to point out a new report that said the Florida economy was doing just fine.", "In an \"open letter to the people of Florida,\" Atwater said the Sunshine State had been ranked\u00a0fifth in fiscal solvency\u00a0by George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. He then contrasted Florida\u2019s success with the beleaguered European nation.", "\"A country in economic peril, Greece\u2019s priorities have historically been very different from Florida\u2019s,\" Atwater wrote\u00a0on July 13, 2015. \"For example, Greeks depend much more on their government for employment and services. Although we have twice the population of Greece, the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees.\"", "PunditFact previously confirmed that Greece\u2019s economic output is\u00a0comparable to Miami, but could that 3-to-1 comparison of public-sector workers be accurate? Yes, if you\u2019re looking at Florida\u2019s direct employees, but experts we talked to said Atwater\u2019s comparison is deeply flawed.", "Greek tragedy", "First of all, let\u2019s stipulate that Greece\u2019s population is about\u00a011 million, while the Census Bureau says Florida is now closing in on\u00a020 million, so he\u2019s close on that point.", "Comparing employment is a bit trickier, since Greece\u2019s public-sector employment has been in flux. To adhere to what its European lenders are demanding, Greece has spent several years trying to cut down its reliance on public-sector jobs.", "Atwater\u2019s office told us they used 2013 data from Greece\u2019s Ministry of Administrative Reform and E-Governance for Greek government workers (653,746) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Current Employment Statistics program for Florida state employees (207,008).", "Several sources agreed 2015 estimates put the current number of Greek public-sector employees at around 600,000. Florida\u2019s employee numbers have stayed relatively stable in that time frame, with about 208,000 this year, so it looks like the 3-to-1 ratio Atwater cited could stand.", "But our experts said the CFO is really comparing oranges to olives here.", "Rollins College business professor James Johnson pointed out that those 600,000 Greek jobs include all government workers -- those paid by the central government and those paid by regional and municipal governments.", "A better way to measure the state\u2019s government employment would be to add Florida\u2019s 133,000 or so federal workers to Atwater\u2019s 207,000 total, Rollins said. And even more important are the more than 730,000 workers toiling away at the local level. Also, Washington sends money to Florida that directly and indirectly affects workers at the state and local levels.", "Add that all up, and there are almost 1.1 million government employees on all levels across Florida at any given time. That is quite a bit more than the 600,000 or so Greek government workers.", "Experts also note that Greek economic woes aren\u2019t entirely about how\u00a0many\u00a0people are currently employed by the government.", "\"Greece\u2019s problem was not so much the size of its public sector, but generous retirement benefits, including pensions,\" Johnson said. Greece doesn\u2019t even top Europe in terms of highest percentage of the workforce employed by the public sector. In 2011, before Greece started cutting workers, it ranked behind\u00a0Italy, Germany and France.", "In any event, fairly comparing a single U.S. state with a sovereign nation is largely impossible, considering the different sets of responsibilities each bears, our experts said.", "Atwater\u2019s office reiterated that it was making a point that the Greek central government is wasteful and poorly run when compared to Florida, but experts told us that it\u2019s difficult at best to draw such parallels.", "\"It\u2019s sort of a totally different system. It is fair to say the state of Florida is more efficient than the country of Greece, but you could say that about any other state,\" Jupiter-based financial analyst Tom Essaye said. \"It would be much more fair to compare Florida to other states than Greece.\"", "Our ruling", "Atwater said, \"the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees\" than Greece.", "Florida does directly employ about one-third as many state government workers as Greece does. But a more reasonable comparison should also include government workers at the federal and local levels -- which means Florida\u2019s overall total of government workers would outnumber Greece\u2019s public-sector employees.", "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate Atwater\u2019s statement Half True.", "Jeff Atwater, \"An open letter to the people of Florida,\" July 13, 2015", "Business Insider, \"Guess Which Country Has The Highest Percentage Of Workers Employed By The Government,\" Nov. 28, 2011", "New York Times, \"Greece to Eliminate 15,000 Government Jobs,\" Feb. 6, 2012", "Greek Reporter, \"The Number of Public Workers in Greece Declines, says Census,\" April 10, 2012", "Reuters, \"Greece to revive public servants dismissal plan - sources,\" Aug. 9, 2012", "New York Times, \"The Cost of Protecting Greece\u2019s Public Sector,\" Oct. 10, 2012", "Christian Science Monitor, \"Greece starts firing civil servants for first time in a century,\" April 26, 2013", "European Commission, \"The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece Fourth Review,\" April 2014", "International Monetary Fund, \"IMF Country Report No. 14/151,\" June 2014", "Greek Reporter, \"Greek Public Sector Employees Reduced by 267,095,\" July 21, 2014", "Orlando Sentinel, \"Syriza: Big, fat economic challenges: Front & Center,\" Feb. 3, 2015", "CNBC, \"Saving Greece is not the ECB\u2019s job: Weidmann,\" March 12, 2015", "Wall Street Journal, \"Greece Rehires Laid Off Cleaners as Syriza Reverses Austerity,\" May 11, 2015", "PolitiFact, \"Jeb Bush says he cut 13,000 state workforce jobs as governor,\" June 9, 2015", "ABC News, \"Some of the Reasons Greece Got Into Its Economic Crisis,\" June 30, 2015", "CNBC, \"Expert predictions on what lies ahead for Greece,\" July 6, 2015", "PunditFact, \"Yep, Greece and Miami metro have about the same GDP,\" July 6, 2015", "Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, Current Employment Statistics, accessed July 16, 2015", "U.S. Census Bureau, Florida Quickfacts, accessed July 16, 2015", "Florida Department of Management Services, \"2013-14 State Personnel System Annual Workplace Report,\" accessed July 16, 2015", "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Government at a Glance 2011: Greece, accessed July 16, 2015", "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida employment: Government, accessed July 16, 2015", "World Bank, World Development Indicators: Greece, accessed July 16, 2015", "George Mason University Mercatus Center, \"How Does Florida Compare to Other States?,\" accessed July 16, 2015", "Interview with Ashley Carr, Atwater spokeswoman, July 16-17, 2015", "Interview with Tom Essaye, financial analyst and Sevens Report creator, July 16, 2015", "Interview with Ilene Grabel, Co-director of the MA program in Global Finance, Trade & Economic Integration at the University of Denver, July 17, 2015", "Interview with James Johnson, Rollins College international business professor and Global Consulting Projects director, July 16-17, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
