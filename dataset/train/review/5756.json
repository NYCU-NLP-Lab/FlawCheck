["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is the Speaker of the House for the 112th Congress.", "Republicans in Congress were not functioning independently of one another on their first workday after the Independence Day holiday.\n\nShortly after noon on July 5, House Speaker John Boehner \"tweeted\" a July 3 blog posting\u00a0from the conservative Weekly Standard\u2019s website, labeling it \"POTUS\u2019 economists: \u2018Stimulus\u2019 Has Cost $278,000 per job.\"\n\nAround 4 p.m., the National Republican Congressional Committee followed suit with multiple press releases\u00a0that used the same Weekly Standard blog item to target dozens of Democrats in Congress, including New Jersey\u2019s Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. Its headline: \"New Report Shows Dems\u2019 Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse.\" It went on to claim that Holt\u2019s and Pallone's\u00a0\"government spending spree\" \"delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China.\"\n\nBy 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled\u00a0the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: \"President Obama\u2019s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job.\"\n\nOur sister website, PolitiFact Ohio, thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, they used his tweet.\n\nThe Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \"saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.\" \u00a0It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill\u2019s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion.\n\nThe $278,000 per job figure doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000.\n\nThe blog item contends this statistic \"provides further evidence that President Obama\u2019s \u2018stimulus\u2019 did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,\" and insists \"the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the \u2018stimulus\u2019 and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead.\"\n\nAfter Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokeswoman Jay Carney said its conclusions were \"based on partial information and simply false analysis.\" White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries \"that are critical to America\u2019s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America\u2019s working families.\"\n\nThe White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn\u2019t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects.\n\nLumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure.\n\nFurthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report\u2019s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure.\n\nRepublicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A \"fact check\" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math \"satisfyingly simple but highly misleading.\"\n\n\"Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers\u2019 output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,\" the 2009 Associated Press item noted.\n\nThe Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually \"has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs.\" It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now.\n\nMoody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data.\n\n\"It\u2019s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA\u2019s help,\" Zandi told TPMDC. \"This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery.\"\n\nThe day after the White House responded to the GOP\u2019s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense\u00a0that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but \"rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000.\" \u00a0\n\nYet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply \"cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the \u2018stimulus?\u2019\"\n\nSo where does that leave Boehner\u2019s tweet -- and the identical claim from the NRCC -- that a report said the stimulus had cost $278,000 per job?", "On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the tweet (and the subsequent variations of the claim) as False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Editor's note: This item was originally published on the Boehner statement.
