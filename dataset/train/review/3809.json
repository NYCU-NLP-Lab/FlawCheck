He rattled off a list of promises that the president has failed to keep.", "Immigration reform is a hot-button issue running up to the mid-term elections, so we wondered about Patterson's flip question to the crowd: \"Remember when he said there will be an immigration bill in the first year?\"", "Incidentally, when we asked Patterson to point to the promise in question, he pointed back at us. \"Got that from the PolitiFact website, I think,\" he said. \"The details are on there.\"", "The national PolitiFact site has endeavored to track the president's promises on its \"Obameter.\" PolitiFact has compiled more than 500 promises Obama made during his campaign, which it then rates as Kept, Broken or a Compromise.", "Which brings us back to a pledge Obama made as a candidate in May 2008, during an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos.", "\"I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,\" Obama said. \"But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting.

Notably, in April 2009, Obama said that he saw the immigration reform \"process moving this first year\" and in June 2009, he assigned Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to put together a framework for comprehensive reform. In September 2009, he said he anticipated \"that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\"", "Famous last words? The year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On Dec. 15, 2009, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, introduced a bill, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies told PolitiFact that it was not promoted or publicly supported by the Obama administration. To gain legal status under the bill, illegal immigrants already here would have to demonstrate they have been working, pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check, among other provisions, according to the New York Times.", "Saying he was frustrated with Obama for not leading an overhaul of immigration laws, Gutierrez, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' immigration task force, was arrested with other protesters after a sit-in in front of the White House on May 1.
