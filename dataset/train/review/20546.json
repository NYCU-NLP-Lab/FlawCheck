Research from the Commonwealth Fund, meanwhile, notes that increasing numbers of \"underinsured\" people do in fact have employer-sponsored health insurance. Underinsured people are those who have coverage but delay care because they still can\u2019t afford it.", "Meanwhile, other polling, such as a January Gallup survey, suggests that about 7 in 10 Americans believe the nation\u2019s health care system is in crisis.", "So while Americans may individually not express frustration with their specific private plans, more are learning that, when they try to actually use that coverage, it doesn\u2019t meet their health needs.", "These findings cast significant shade on the idea that all 160 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage actually like it.", "Our ruling", "Biden argued that \"160 million people like their private insurance.\"", "A cursory look at polling would suggest that most of the people he\u2019s talking about \u2014 Americans who get coverage through work \u2014 are happy with their plans.", "But once you dig a little deeper, that narrative gets more complicated.
