["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on March 14, 2018", "In observing that \u201cevery type of energy has consequences,\u201d Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke claimed the \u201ccarbon footprint on wind [energy] is significant.\u201d In fact, wind power\u2019s carbon footprint is among the smallest of any energy source.", "Coal\u2019s carbon footprint is almost 90 times larger than that of wind energy, and the footprint of natural gas is more than 40 times larger, according to the Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.", "Zinke also said\u00a0wind energy kills \u201cas many as 750,000 birds a year.\u201d\u00a0This estimate is high, but not impossible. However,\u00a0oil fields could kill up to 1 million birds a year, according to the Bureau of Land Management.", "Zinke\u00a0made his claims\u00a0in a speech to oil and gas executives\u00a0during the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston on March 6,\u00a0according to reporting by Time. We verified his statements using an audio recording of the event sent to us by\u00a0Time reporter Justin Worland.", "Zinke, March 6: Every type of energy has consequences. \u2026 We probably chop up as many as 750,000 birds a year on wind. And the carbon footprint on wind is significant.", "In 2017, wind energy made up about 6.3 percent of the United States\u2019 total electricity generation, according to the Energy Information Administration. That\u2019s compared with about 30 percent each for coal and natural gas and 20 percent for nuclear energy. At 7.5 percent, hydropower contributed the most out of any renewable source. Solar energy made up only 1.3 percent.", "When we contacted the DOI for support for Zinke\u2019s claims, spokeswoman Heather Swift told us by email that, when it comes to wind\u2019s carbon footprint, Zinke \u201cwas referring to the life-cycle emissions, manufacturing of materials and component parts, and the transportation and construction of the facilities.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that wind power isn\u2019t a zero emission energy source. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced when wind turbines are manufactured, built, maintained and decommissioned.\u00a0But the \u201clife cycle greenhouse gas emissions from solar, wind, and nuclear technologies are considerably lower and less variable than emissions from technologies powered by combustion-based natural gas and coal,\u201d\u00a0says the NREL.", "To be more exact, wind energy produces around\u00a011 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated,\u00a0Garvin A. Heath, a senior scientist at NREL, and colleagues concluded after reviewing the scientific literature. That\u2019s compared with about 980 g CO2/kWh for coal and roughly\u00a0465 g CO2/kWh for natural gas, Heath found.", "In other words, coal\u2019s carbon footprint is almost 90 times larger than that of wind. The footprint of natural gas is more than 40 times larger.", "Coal power plants using carbon recapture and storage technology do produce significantly lower emissions than standard coal power plants, though still more than wind power. Just as it sounds, this technology prevents CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere by capturing it and storing it, often underground.", "Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at the University of Texas, Austin\u2019s Energy Institute, found that, without this technology, coal power plants produce about 870\u00a0g CO2/kWh, but with the technology they produce around 156\u00a0g CO2/kWh.\u00a0According to the EIA, there are two coal power plants using this technology in operation in the world \u2013 one in Texas and one in Saskatchewan, Canada.", "How did the carbon footprints of plants with carbon recapture technology compare with that of wind?", "Like Heath, Rhodes found that wind power had one of the smallest carbon footprints at 14 g CO2/kWh, second only to nuclear power.\u00a0That\u2019s a carbon footprint over 11 times smaller than that of coal with carbon capture technology.", "Heath also found nuclear power\u2019s carbon footprint was close to wind\u2019s at\u00a012 g CO2/kWh.", "What about wind compared with other forms of renewable energy?", "Heath and colleagues at the DOE\u2019s Brookhaven National Laboratory found that the footprint of solar power varied from 14 to 45\u00a0g CO2/kWh, depending on the type of material used. For example, thin-film solar cells\u00a0\u2014 which can be made into\u00a0rooftop shingles, glazing for skylights and other building materials \u2014 have a smaller carbon footprint than\u00a0crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, which are\u00a0frequently used in commercial energy production.", "Geothermal energy\u2019s footprint was similar to solar\u2019s,\u00a0ranging from 11.3 to 47\u00a0g CO2/kWh, depending on the type of technology used, Heath found. Geothermal energy entails capturing heat from the Earth to turn turbines that generate electricity.", "Heath also told us via email that biopower \u2014 which comes from burning organic materials, such as wood, landfill materials or ethanol \u2014 had a carbon footprint of about 43\u00a0g CO2/kWh.", "On the whole, hydropower and ocean power appear to produce the lowest amount of emissions at 7 and 8\u00a0g CO2/kWh, respectively,\u00a0Heath said. Hydropower is generated from moving water, often from rivers. Ocean power\u00a0generates electricity from the tides, waves, currents, heat and even salinity of oceans.", "To be clear, all of these figures are median, or midpoint, estimates, among a range of estimates for each type of energy.", "In other words, every single wind turbine, hydroelectric dam or coal plant won\u2019t have the same exact carbon footprint, but the figures cited above can be taken as representative for comparison purposes.", "Wind power, as well as other forms of energy, does take other environmental tolls \u2014 a point Zinke also made during the\u00a0CERAWeek energy conference. He said, \u201cWe probably chop up as many as 750,000 birds a year with wind.\u201d", "We\u00a0wrote about this topic back in 2016, when then presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed\u00a0wind farms in the U.S. \u201ckill more than 1 million birds a year.\u201d", "In our 2016 article, we pointed out that the highest average estimate is 573,000 bird deaths a year from wind turbines. Gavin Shire, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service, told us over the phone that the maximum\u00a0estimate is 679,000 bird deaths.", "However, these numbers are from 2013, which means they may be dated, given increases in wind power since then \u2014 a point Shire made and we made in our original piece. So 750,000 bird deaths from wind turbines could be possible today.", "As we also noted back in 2016, the BLM has found that oil fields could be killing up to 1 million birds a year. But even oil fields pale in comparison to domestic cats, which scientists estimate kill billions of birds a year.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
