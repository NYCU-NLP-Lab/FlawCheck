["For years, members of Congress\u00a0have pressured drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers to bring under control the rising costs of\u00a0insulin and epinephrine for millions of Americans with diabetes or allergies.", "In July 2020, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders aimed at reining in prescription drug costs. One required that federally qualified health centers, which purchase insulin and epinephrine through what's called the 340B drug program, pass along any savings they receive from discounted drug prices to medically underserved patients.", "The rule blocks health centers\u00a0from receiving future federal grants unless they charge patients no more than their acquisition price for insulin and EpiPens \u2014 epinephrine auto-injectors \u2014 plus a small\u00a0administration fee.", "At the time, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the move would increase access to insulin and EpiPens\u00a0for the 28 million patients who visit community health centers\u00a0annually, over 6 million of whom are uninsured.", "On the campaign trail last year, Trump made repeated claims that,\u00a0because of the executive orders, he was succeeding in his promise to lower drug prices.", "HHS approved the rule affecting community health centers in December, and it was to go into effect Jan. 22.", "A user on Facebook claims President Joe Biden is now \"reversing\" Trump's executive order. \u201cThis is NOT a partisan issue and will harm Americans,\u201d reads\u00a0the Jan. 22 post, which has almost 1,000 shares.", "Another social media user claimed Biden has ended \"the savings for epi pens and insulin.\"", "USA TODAY reached out to the social media user\u00a0for comment.", "More:Fact check: No basis for claims that President Joe Biden's inauguration was faked", "Biden's White House\u00a0chief of staff, Ronald Klain,\u00a0announced a\u00a0regulatory freeze of \u201cany new and pending rules\u201d as Biden took office on Jan. 20. The freeze on the insulin and epinephrine rule\u00a0is effective until March 22.", "According to Bloomberg Law, \"A regulatory pause is a common tradition among incoming presidents to ensure that the unfinished policies from the prior administration align with the new one.\"", "The National Association of Community Health Centers, among others, expressed support for\u00a0the\u00a0new administration's move, saying\u00a0the Trump rule would not have lowered the cost of insulin and EpiPens for most Americans who use them, as advertised.", "In a Jan. 25 statement, it also said the Trump rule reflected\u00a0\"a fundamental misunderstanding\" of federally qualified health centers and the 340B drug program, placing extensive administrative burdens on them.", "\u201cThe stated aim was to cut drug prices. However, it triggered alarm among safety net providers and bipartisan lawmakers because it would accomplish the opposite of what the Trump Administration intended \u2014 ultimately making it harder for health centers to provide affordable life-saving services and prescription drugs \u2014 especially during the pandemic,\u201d the association said.", "It pointed out that the only patients affected would be those using the health centers.", "The overall prices of insulin and EpiPens across the country are not affected by the Trump administration regulation or the recent action by the Biden administration, the health center association said.", "Community health centers serve one in 11 Americans across the country, according to the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration.", "More:Here are all the executive orders President Joe Biden has signed so far", "Nationally, 30 million Americans suffer from diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. And nearly one in 50 Americans are at risk for anaphylaxis brought on by certain foods, insect bites, medications and latex, according to a 2013 study by\u00a0the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.", "But not all\u00a0of those patients require insulin or epinephrine.\u00a0And most who live in extreme poverty, or less than\u00a0200%\u00a0of the federal poverty level\u00a0\u2014 an equation that works out to $34,840 for a family of two\u00a0\u2014\u00a0already receive free or discounted prescription drugs, a national health policy expert said.", "Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan\u00a0nonprofit that analyzes health policy, said some patients served by the 1,400 federally backed health centers nationally, such as those\u00a0with high deductibles or those who are uninsured and paying list prices for the drugs,\u00a0would have benefitted from the new pricing rule.", "But it's hard to say how many, she said. It's also difficult to speculate about how many new patients would switch care to a community health center\u00a0to take advantage of the discounted insulin and EpiPen prices, she said.", "In addition,\u00a0Sayeh Nikpay, associate professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that while freezing the Trump rule might make some patients who get insulin or epinephrine\u00a0from health center worse off, it risked reducing services for wider swath of needy patients if it resulted in cutting access to the 340B program by the centers, which use its revenues to subsidize their programs.", "U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, who opposed the Trump administration rule, said in a news release that\u00a0\u201cby targeting the centers providing these medications to those without insurance or the means to get the care instead of big pharmaceutical companies, HHS risks making things worse for a community already in need. Community Health Centers provide critical lifelines in our communities. They aren\u2019t the reason why drug costs, especially insulin costs, are too high in this country.\u201d", "We rate this claim\u00a0about the Biden administration's action\u00a0to be MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research. Some patients who use insulin and EpiPens \u2014 the fraction who are served by federally qualified health centers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0may benefit from Trump's order, but others could suffer if it results in decreased access for the centers to the 340B drug discount program. Also, the freeze through March 22 does not represent final action on the program, so it's premature to call it a \"reversal.\"", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
