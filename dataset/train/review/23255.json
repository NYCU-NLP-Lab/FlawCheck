So none of it is extraneous,\" said McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom.

The law\u2019s new tax payments and credits will also be on returns, of course.", "In 2015, Crusberg said, the IRS will start collecting coverage information from insurance providers. Employers who insure their own workers in-house will report which employees are enrolled and give enough information so the IRS can tell if those workers are due a tax credit. Self-insuring employers will also put the cost of the plan they\u2019re providing on W-2 forms so workers can see it.", "Is the new data \"private\" information?", "Per the CMS fact sheet, Obamacare applicants could be asked to cough up some personal health information.
