Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income Americans, and pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities who meet certain criteria.", "The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults. States could choose whether to participate in the expansion. Trump wants to repeal that expansion and give states more control over the program. The budget proposes Medicaid funding through a per-capita cap or block grants to states.", "The budget would reduce Medicaid funding by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and eliminate $500 billion in subsidies that help lower-income people purchase coverage in the ACA marketplaces. It adds $1.2 trillion for grants to states over that 10-year period.", "In total, the proposed budget cuts to Medicaid and ACA coverage programs amount to about a $777 billion Medicaid reduction over 10 years, according to Aviva Aron-Dine, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.", "The proposed Medicaid changes would likely result in coverage and benefit reductions, said\u00a0Marc Goldwein, vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.", "Our analysis of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act found that every income group is expected to pay less in taxes in 2019, but the benefits of the tax bill flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers.

By 2027, every income group below $75,000 sees a tax increase, our analysis said.", "While spending cuts can be seen as a way to compensate for tax cuts, there isn\u2019t a direct link between the proposed health care cuts and the recently passed tax law, experts told us.", "\"The existence of tax cuts may put more pressure to cut Medicare and Medicaid,\" Goldwein said. \"But any relationship is indirect.\"", "Castro said Trump\u2019s fiscal year 2020 budget \"slashes investments in health care to pay for tax cuts to billionaires.\"", "Castro\u2019s choice of word, \"slashes,\" is subjective. There\u2019s some truth to Castro\u2019s about health care reductions, since Trump\u2019s proposal decreases the health department\u2019s budget. The plan calls for a restructuring of Medicaid that would likely lead to reduced coverage and benefits. The budget also reduces future Medicare spending, but that mainly affects health care providers, not beneficiaries.", "It\u2019s misleading to say that the health care changes pay for tax cuts to billionaires, because there isn\u2019t a direct link between them. It\u2019s also worth noting that while in the long-run the tax cuts remain in place for higher earning individuals, every income group on average is expected to pay less in taxes in 2019 because of the tax law.", "Castro\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
