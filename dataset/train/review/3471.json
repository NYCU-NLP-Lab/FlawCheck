Its June 30 headline read, \"Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.\"", "The New York Times report didn\u2019t go that far, so we decided to dig deeper into the Kwotable claim.", "Trump\u2019s relationship with Deutsche Bank began in the late nineties when many other major lenders were unwilling to do business with him. Between 1991 and 1992, Trump declared bankruptcy four times, making him unpopular among Wall Street bankers, who referred to making deals with him as \"Donald risk.\"", "Deutsche Bank opened up to working with Trump after launching its real estate division in 1998. Mike Offit, a newly-hired managing director, gave Trump a loan to renovate his building on Wall Street, and continued to work with him through the 2008 financial crisis.", "According to a 2017 report by the New York Times, Trump has done more than $4 billion in business with Deutsche since then, including the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Doral in Miami.", "Justin Kennedy began working at Deutsche in 1998 as the managing director and global head of Real Estate Capital Markets, a role he held until leaving in 2009. Kennedy oversaw and approved major real estate loans given through the bank, including multiple loans made to Trump for his real estate enterprise.", "Trump\u2019s connections to Russia are still being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Deutsche Bank\u2019s relationship to the country is well-documented, and controversial.", "In early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal \"mirror-trading.\" (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch, and then a conspirator would sell identical stocks for the same price, but through the London branch and in dollars. This money would be transferred to offshore accounts, effectively allowing traders to illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. According to Reuters, this scheme began in 2011.)", "Between 2010 and 2014, the bank was also involved in the \"Global Laundromat\" scandal, which allowed over $20 billion to be funneled from Russia to other countries around the world. The Global Laundromat was a much larger operation than the mirror-trading. It involved top Russian oligarchs and criminals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Igor Putin, cousin of President Vladimir Putin.", "The bank\u2019s name has come up in the Mueller investigation as well, but not in the way the Kwotable article makes you think. In December 2017, Mueller\u2019s team subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records connected with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had been indicted in October on suspicion of money laundering, among other crimes.", "However, there has been no evidence to date that Trump himself was involved with any of the money laundering \u2014 or that either Kennedy was involved.", "Democrats have called for more transparency in Trump\u2019s banking history,\u00a0but the bank has denied their requests, citing confidentiality concerns. The records would be released only in the event of a formal investigation.", "As for Justin Kennedy, he left Deutsche Bank in 2009, before investigators say the Global Laundromat or mirror-trading scandals began. He has not been formally investigated or accused of involvement in financial foul play.", "Kennedy and Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story.", "Bloggers wrote that Justice Kennedy retired last week because \"he and his son helped launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.\"", "This story has all the buzz words to make a good conspiracy theory: Russia, real estate, billions of dollars, coincidence, corruption. But there is no evidence that Trump and Justin Kennedy ever had a relationship beyond Trump\u2019s real estate loans.", "There is also no evidence that Kennedy was involved in Russian money laundering, as he left the bank before either of the major scandals happened, or that the Trump White House was blackmailing his father because of it.", "We rate this claim False.", "New York Times,\u00a0\"Inside the White House\u2019s Quiet Campaign to Create a Supreme Court Opening,\" June 28, 2018", "PolitiFact, \"Yep, Donald Trump's companies have declared bankruptcy...more than four times,\" June 21, 2016", "New York Times, \"Trump Boasts of Rapport With Wall St., but the Feeling Is Not Quite Mutual,\" May 23, 2016", "New York Times,\u00a0\"Big German Bank, Key to Trump\u2019s Finances, Faces New Scrutiny,\" July 19, 2017", "Financial Times,\u00a0\"Donald Trump\u2019s debt to Deutsche Bank,\" August 30, 2017", "CNN Money,\u00a0\"Deutsche Bank fined for $10 billion Russian money-laundering scheme,\" January 31, 2017", "New York State Department of Financial Services,\u00a0\"DFS fines Deutsche Bank $425 million for Russian mirror-trading scheme,\" January 30, 2017", "The Guardian,\u00a0\"Bank that lent $300m to Trump linked to Russian money laundering scam,\" March 21, 2017", "The Guardian,\u00a0\"British banks handled vast sums of laundered Russian money,\" March 20, 2017", "Bloomberg,\u00a0\"Deutsche Bank Records Said to Be Subpoenaed by Mueller,\" December 5, 2017", "PolitiFact,\u00a0\"What you need to know about Manafort indictment, Papadopoulos guilty plea,\" October 30, 2017", "Bloomberg,\u00a0\"Deutsche Bank Refuses Democrats\u2019 Request for Reports on Trump,\" June 29, 2017", "Email Interview with Jeff Hauser, Director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic Policy and Research", "Reuters,\u00a0\"The 'mirror' trades that caught Deutsche in Russian web,\" January 30, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
