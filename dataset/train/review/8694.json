The letter is scathing, however it appears Morgan and Trump's friendship was already on the outs when Morgan wrote it.", "Morgan's letter was largely a critique of Trump's handling of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and read in part:", "You are the most powerful person in America and your words carry enormous weight and consequence.

You have a notoriously thin skin and take any criticism very badly.", "In the letter, Morgan also notes that Trump unfollowed him on Twitter after Morgan posted another column for the Daily Mail days earlier that began with \"SHUT THE F**K UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP.\"", "In the April 27 open letter, Morgan acknowledged that he and Trump had been friends for 15 years, \"But if you can\u2019t handle my criticism, and our friendship is over, then let me mark the end of our relationship with a few home truths about your spectacularly bad handling of this crisis that may yet, if you heed them, still enable you to get re-elected in November.\"", "Because the letter circulating on social media was indeed written by Morgan, we rate this claim \"Correct attribution.\"", "Morgan, Piers.\u00a0\"An Open Letter to President Trump from His (Now Unfollowed) Friend PIERS MORGAN: Cut the COVID Crap, Stop Whining, Get Serious and Show Some Damn Empathy - Or It Will Cost You the White House.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Daily Mail.\u00a027 April 2020.", "Morgan, Piers.\u00a0\"President Trump's Batsh*t Crazy Coronavirus 'Cure' Theories Are Not Just Shockingly Senseless and Stupid - They're Going to Kill People.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Daily Mail.\u00a024 April 2020.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
