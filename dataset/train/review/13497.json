["Facebook posts, archived here, here and here, specifically warn against the cocktail carrots sold at major Canadian supermarkets IGA, Metro and Loblaws, claiming they are \u201cdipped in a solution of water and chlorine,\u201d and that the \u201cwhite covering\u201d that may form on the carrots after a few days is the chlorine resurfacing.", "The posts vary slightly, but one shared more than 242,000 times concludes: \u201cI know that I will never buy them again!!!!\u201d", "But food science experts say the chlorine water wash is both safe and economical for food processing.", "\u201cChlorine is a very effective and safe sanitizer when used under proper conditions,\u201d Dr. Olga Padilla-Zakour, director of the Cornell University Food Venture Center, told AFP by email.", "If the water is not sanitized, it could become a source of contamination, she said.", "Dr. Elliot Ryser, a professor in the Michigan State University department of food science and human nutrition, told AFP by phone: \u201cVirtually all fresh-cut produce uses a sanitizer. It\u2019s used to prevent contamination from the water to the product. The sanitizer does a good job of killing organisms in the wash water.\u201d", "The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) website also states that chlorinated wash water is used on a variety of ready-to-eat, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, in order \u201cto reduce microbial load.\u201d", "Alan Hilowitz, spokesman for Bolthouse Farms, a supplier of cocktail carrots to Canadian supermarkets, said in a statement: \u201cThe amount of chlorine in the carrot wash water is well within the limits set by the CFIA and is comparable to levels found in tap or drinking water.\u201d", "\u201cFor fresh-cut produce, the concentration of chlorine in water is very, very low, in the range of 10 to 100 parts per million,\u201d Padilla-Zakour said.", "The Bolthouse Farms statement also specified that the chlorine is used during food processing to disinfect the water, not to \u201cpreserve the product\u201d as the Facebook posts state.", "The secondary claim in the posts about a white film sometimes found on carrots is false. It is not chlorine resurfacing on the vegetables.", "Health Canada explains here: \u201cWhite blush is not an indication that there is anything unsafe or unhealthy about the carrots, rather it is a sign that the surface of the carrot has dried out.\u201d", "Soaking the carrots in water can temporarily remove the whiteness.", "The claim was similarly debunked by the McGill University Office for Science and Society\u00a0here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
