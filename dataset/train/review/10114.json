Many mild COVID-19 cases go unreported, making it hard to estimate how many infected individuals have died. Plus, the death toll due to COVID-19 could be higher than we know.", "Nevertheless, the way the doctors made their calculations was problematic, experts said.", "The Bakersfield doctors used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinics and in California to extrapolate to the entire state and put the fatality rate for infected individuals at 0.03%. They made the claims in an April 22 press conference broadcast by local news.", "They said 340 of the 5,213 patients they had tested at their clinics had returned positive results, meaning roughly 6.5% had COVID-19.

The first is \"a temporal estimate for what\u2019s going on with COVID,\" he said, while the second is \"reported every year retrospectively.\"", "\"That\u2019s something that\u2019s not comparable,\" he said.", "Some of the first widely reported figures have been case fatality rates, which are calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.
