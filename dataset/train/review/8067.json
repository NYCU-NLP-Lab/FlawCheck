And so, I know all the rules about not saluting in civilian clothes and so forth, and when you should or shouldn't. But then when I got this job -- (laughter) -- and I would be approaching Air Force One or Marine One and those Marines would come to a salute and I -- knowing that I am in civilian clothes -- I would nod and say \u2018Hello\u2019 and think they could drop their hand, and they wouldn't. They just stood there. So, one night over at the commandant's quarters, Marine Commandant's quarters in Washington, and I was getting a couple of highballs, and I didn't -- (laughter) -- know what to do with them. So, I said to the commandant -- I said, \u2018Look, I know all the rules about saluting in civilian clothes and all, but if I am the Commander in Chief, there ought to be a regulation that would permit me to return a salute.\u2019 And I heard some words of wisdom. He said, \u2018I think if you did, no one would say anything.\u2019", "\"So, if you see me on television and I'm saluting, you know that I've got authority for it now -- (laughter) -- and I do it happily.\"", "For the record, Army regulations simply say soldiers are not required to salute when they are in civilian clothes.", "What to make of all of this?", "Reagan does appear to be the first president who made the presidential salute commonplace, especially when exiting or boarding Air Force One or Marine One.
