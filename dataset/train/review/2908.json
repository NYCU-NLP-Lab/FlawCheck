The strapline reads: \u201cELECTIONS 2020 / JOE BIDEN LISTED AS CRIMINAL SUSPECT IN UKRAINIAN COURT\u201d.", "The post\u2019s caption, written in both traditional Chinese and English, states: \u201cUkraine has now listed Joe Biden as wanted on Class A felony Charges\u201d.", "The video and screenshots of it have also been shared alongside a similar claim\u00a0here and here on Facebook, here on Twitter, and on various websites, such as\u00a0here.", "However, the claim is false.", "A keyword search on Google found the original video published here on OAN\u2019s YouTube channel on May 21, 2020. The title reads: \u201cJoe Biden listed as criminal suspect in Ukrainian court\u201d.", "The video reports, in part: \u201cCandidate and former Vice President Joe Biden finds himself in hot water this week. Just confirmed, a Ukrainian court ordered Joe Biden to be formally listed in a criminal case. The crime - the alleged firing of Ukraine's former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, in exchange for dropping an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and the company for which he was a board member, Burisma oil.", "\u201cAt the time Shokin called for this case, back in February, the courts listed one of the defendants as \u2018an unnamed American\u2019, an individual widely understood to be Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s Ukraine point man, but Biden was never formally named. Now, courts have ruled it is improper to conceal Biden's name and there is sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation. The ruling cannot be appealed.\u201d", "There is no reference to\u00a0\u201cClass A felony charges\u201d in the\u00a0video.", "The clip also makes a misleading claim about the Ukrainian case in which Biden was mentioned.", "In February 2020, Ukraine's ex-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin filed a criminal complaint against Biden, accusing the then-US vice president of pressuring for his dismissal.", "Opening a criminal case file in Ukraine is not the same as launching a criminal investigation. Ukraine expert Adrian Karatnycky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told PolitiFact:\u00a0\u201cCriminal case files are opened pending investigations at the request of parliamentarians, on the basis media allegations, requests from civic groups and citizens. This is not the same as an actual criminal investigation. Such cases are registered and do not rise to the level of criminal investigations until the allegations are first vetted.\u201d", "Ukraine police subsequently announced on November 11 that it had closed its criminal probe, prompted by Shokin's complaint, after finding no evidence of wrongdoing. Ukraine\u2019s national news agency Ukrinform announced here on November 11, 2020 that the case had been closed.", "Multiple keyword searches also found no credible reports of criminal charges against Biden in Ukraine as of November 20, 2020.", "AFP has previously debunked false claims about Biden\u2019s involvement in the firing of Shokin\u00a0here in October 2020.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
