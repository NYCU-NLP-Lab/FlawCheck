["About this rating", "On 12 November 2016, the disreputable web site\u00a0The Rightists\u00a0published a hoax\u00a0news article reporting\u00a0that\u00a0New York Times\u00a0columnist David Brooks said that Donald Trump would 'resign, be impeached, or get assassinated' within the first six months of his presidency:", "From Brooks' column: \"Finally, it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result\u2026Trump's bigotry, dishonesty and promise-breaking will have to be denounced. We can't go morally numb. But he needs to be replaced with a program that addresses the problems that fueled his assent. After all, the guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year.\"", "However, while commenting on his column in a subsequent interview with KYRQ Radio in New York City, Brooks said, \"Oh, and by the way \u2013 I forgot to mention 'assassinated.'\" The columnist then went on to say that \"the whole 'pen is mightier than the sword' philosophy might have worked if we were talking about Hillary Clinton, but when it comes to Donald Trump, you don't really need a pen, because he'll bury himself soon enough.\" \"At the rate he's going, I'm starting to wonder if he'll make it through the first six months, let alone an entire year,\" Brooks said.", "The Rightists\u00a0is a \"hybrid\" web site that publishes stories containing a mixture of true and inaccurate information:", "This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet.
