["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Stem cells hold the potential to treat, and even cure, some of our most deadly and debilitating illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes. To make the cells do their magic, research is needed \u2014 and the University of Wisconsin has been at the forefront of that work.\n\nBut for many people, there is a tension between conducting such research and protecting the sanctity of human life. The dilemma confronts not only scientists, but politicians, who are able to set government funding priorities and even place limits on the work scientists do.\n\nAs in 2006, stem cell research has become an issue in the race for governor.\nJust as outgoing Gov, Jim Doyle did four years ago, Democratic nominee Tom Barrett is running a TV ad that paints his Republican opponent \u2014 Scott Walker \u2014 as extreme on the issue.\n\nThe ad features a mother talking to the camera about her son, who has juvenile diabetes. She describes how stem cell research \"gives our family hope, hope for a cure,\" and she continues with a blunt declaration:\n\n\"Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin. That\u2019s right, ban it.\" \u00a0\n\nIt is the mother making the statement. But as the candidate, Barrett is responsible for the content of the ad. Indeed, as the mother speaks, the words \"Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research\" appear on the screen.\n\nBefore we can evaluate the accuracy of Barrett\u2019s claim, we need a brief explanation of stem cells and the current state of science.\n\nHere are some key points from a primer by the National Institutes of Health:\n\nStem cells are important for two reasons: As a generic type of cell, stem cells can renew themselves through cell division. Moreover, they can be induced to become specific tissue or organ cells that have special functions. That gives stem cells their potential to treat, and someday even cure, a number of diseases.\n\nScientists work with two types of stem cells: embryonic and adult. Embryonic stem cells are derived from an embryo, which science defines as the \"developing organism from the time of fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation, when it is called a fetus.\" Adult stem cells, in contrast, come not from a developing organism but from the body.\n\nEmbryonic stem cells have a crucial advantage: With regard to treating diseases, embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body. Adult stem cells are thought to be limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin.\n\nThe embryonic-adult distinction is critical, though it is not mentioned in the TV ad.\n\nThe mother in the ad is Heidi Fallone. She and her husband, Edward, are two of the six members of the board of directors of Wisconsin Stem Cell Now, a group that advocates specifically for embryonic stem cell research.\n\nHeidi Fallone\u2019s connection to the group is not mentioned in the ad. She is presented as an average mother, with her message packing an emotional wallop as strong as the words: Walker would ban stem cell research.\n\nIn truth, Walker\u2019s comments on the topic have expressed support for stem cell research generally \u2014 but not if it involves embryos.\n\nIt is a line that many candidates have drawn, including Mark Green, who was the subject of Doyle\u2019s attack in 2006. In his ad, Doyle used a Verona mother, pictured with her young daughter, who has diabetes. The mother said Green would \"outlaw stem cell research.\" \u00a0\n\nIn the 2010 campaign, Walker and his campaign staff have issued various statements, including two in August, that spell out his position.\n\nIn one, a day after a U.S. district judge shut down federal funding of all research involving embryonic stem cells, a Walker aide said, \"We can realize the potential of stem cell research without destroying human embryos or resorting to human cloning. We can both protect the earliest stages of life and find cures.\"\n\nIn another statement, also in the wake of the judge\u2019s ruling, Walker himself said that \"science has shown us repeatedly that you can have successful stem cell research without destroying a human embryo.\"\n\nAs an alternative to embryonic stem cell research, researchers have been developing techniques to reprogram adult cells back to the embryonic state. But recent studies have revealed problems. The reprogrammed cells appear to retain a memory of their previous role \u2014 as skin, for example \u2014 and differ in subtle ways from embryonic stem cells.\n\nIn response to questions, the Barrett campaign has defended its TV ad.\n\nCampaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Associated Press: \"Embryonic stem cell research is stem cell research, Walker wants to ban it \u2014 he wants to ban stem cell research.\"\n\nThe statement, though, shifts the debate. No one disputes that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research.\n\nAs additional support, Walzak provided PolitiFact Wisconsin two newspaper articles and a survey Walker completed for the group Pro-Life Wisconsin. But the material, like other items cited, \u00a0showed only that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research, not that he wants to ban all stem cell research.\n\nIn an interview, Walzak said the Barrett ad is accurate because it is widely known that only embryonic stem cell research \u2014 not adult stem cell research \u2014 is being debated in terms of a research ban.\n\nHowever, since the ad began running, Barrett has altered his message. An e-mail sent by Barrett\u2019s campaign to supporters, signed by Fallone, says Walker would ban \"critical\" stem cell research. It goes on to criticize Walker\u2019s opposition to embryonic stem cell research.\n\nIf anything, that underlines how inaccurate the TV ad\u2019s language is.\n\nSo, where does that leave us?\n\nDemocrat Tom Barrett is running a TV ad claiming his opponent for governor, Republican Scott Walker, \"would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin.\" \u00a0In truth, Walker has repeatedly said he supports research involving adult stem cells, but opposes research involving embryonic stem cells. That is a critical distinction in the world of science \u2014 and of politics. Barrett\u2019s ad ignores it, presenting Walker as so extreme on the matter that he is \"against hope.\"\n\nWe rate Barrett\u2019s claim False.", "Associated Press, Wisconsin GOP governor candidate Scott Walker calls Democrat Tom Barrett's ad on stem cells a 'lie' in Green Bay Press-Gazette, Oct. 3, 2010\n\nBarrett for governor campaign, Fallone ad, Oct. 1, 2010\n\nBarrett for governor campaign, e-mail to supporters, Oct. 7, 2010\n\nDoyle for governor campaign, 2006, Six Times TV ad\n\nE-mail and telephone interview with Barrett for governor campaign spokesman Phil Walzak, Oct. 7 and 8, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Walker for governor campaign spokesman Jill Bader, Oct. 6 and 8, 2010\n\nInterview with Pro-Life Wisconsin Director of Legislative Affairs Matt Sande, Oct. 8, 2010\n\nJSOnline.com, Green blasts Doyle ad, defends record, July 24, 2006\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ruling shuts down $70 million in stem cell projects, Aug. 24, 2010\n\nNational Institutes of Health, Stem Cell Basics\n\nWisconsin Stem Cell Now website\n\nWITI-TV, Gubernatorial candidates differ on funding stem cell research, Aug. 26, 2010.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
