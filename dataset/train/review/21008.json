An April 4 tweet, which was \"liked\" more than 33,000 times, calls the girl \"Emily Jones Bolton\" and says the \"media buried her story because her killer is a 30 year old Somali immigrant.\" Another tweet, from April 3, claims \"the media refuses to cover the story in order to protect the savage killer who is a Somali immigrant.\"", "We read nearly two dozen news articles about the killing and none mentioned the suspect\u2019s name, nationality or immigration status.", "We contacted the local police department about the Facebook post.
