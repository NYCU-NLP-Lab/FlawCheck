["About this rating", "A photograph of a white horse standing at the window on the third floor of a brick building has long been circulated via social media, along with the claim that a tenant was discovered to have been keeping the equine in his apartment:", "This picture has also become the subject of numerous humorous image macros, including the infamous \"Soon\" meme:", "But this enigmatic horse was not spotted in Preston, Lancashire, or in many of the other locations attached to sightings of it. As documented by Google Street View, this horse was \"residing\" in Galena, Illinois (a town known for its well-preserved, 19th-century buildings and the home of Ulysses S. Grant just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861:", "Moreover, this horse does not \"live\" with a tenant in a Galena apartment. As more close-up photographs have revealed, the equine is simply a life-size statue, similar to ones seen here.", "https://www.shutterbug.com/content/white-horse-window", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
