The foundation was quick to respond, sending us, among other things, a link to a story that appeared in The Washington Post in September 2014 under the headline \"Southern States are now epicenter of HIV/AIDS in the U.S.\"", "The article quoted Rainey Campbell, then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, as saying Southern states now have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease and the most people dying from it.", "The foundation also sent a link to a report by the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) from November 2012, examining HIV epidemiology in the South using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies.", "The report focused on nine states in the South that were identified as \"particularly affected by HIV\" \u00a0-- Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.", "The targeted states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States -- 23.8 per 100,000 -- according to the CDC data, the report found.

Couldn\u2019t it be that other regions are doing a better job with education/treatment? Nic Carlisle, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition, said it\u2019s likely \"a combination of both.\"", "The most recent CDC surveillance report shows the country was making moderate progress until 2011, when the number of new diagnosis started moving in the wrong direction again -- with only the West showing a decrease in 2012-2013, Carlisle said.", "The increases were 3.4 percent in the Midwest, 3.2 percent in the Northeast, but substantially greater -- 7.5 percent for the South in 2012-2013, he said.", "\"True, we\u2019ve have made remarkable progress in addressing the HIV epidemic in the United States. Treatment advances have transformed what was once a fatal diagnosis into a chronic disease for many,\" Carlisle said.", "\"Unfortunately, while the rest of the country reaps the benefits of this progress, the South is in danger of being left behind.\"", "Even the Obama administration recognizes the need to stem the widening HIV-related health disparities that plague the South.

For epidemiologists, this is indeed a dramatic increase,\" he said.", "\"Finally, even when considering the lack of increases in HIV diagnoses in the South overall, it\u2019s important to note that new HIV infections and new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. have both been stubbornly stable at around 45,000 to 50,000 cases each year,\" Sullivan said. \"And in this context, the lack of substantial decreases in new HIV infections is also a dramatic public health problem.\"", "The Elton John AIDS Foundation has made 31 grants worth a combined $1.4 million aimed at addressing the South's HIV/AIDS epidemic.", "These includes grants worth $315,000 given out earlier this year, in partnership with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to six organizations.
