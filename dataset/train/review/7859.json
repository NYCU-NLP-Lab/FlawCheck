The structure to operate a fund like this, which hundreds of companies do through the same third-party, requires the program to be open to public contributions but we are not soliciting those contributions in any way.", "Amazon truly did launch a $25 million fund to provide sick leave for contract workers and seasonal employees through a grant program to which those workers must file applications before receiving benefits.", "Although the wording on the page has since been updated to indicate that donations are not expected, initially the language did indicate that Amazon was seeking \u2014 or at the very least suggesting \u2014 donations. An archived version of the page from March 19, 2020, included this statement (shown in the screen capture below): \"The Fund relies primarily on individual donations from individuals and support from Amazon.com Services LLC to fund this program.\"\n\nThe page has since been updated. The highlighted sentence above was removed and the page now explicitly states that donations from the public are not expected, as follows:\nWe reached out to Legum, who told us via email that he believed Amazon changed the wording on the relief fund page \"because the optics were clearly bad and the company is trying to cover up its actions.\" Legum added that in his view, \"Amazon has ample resources to simply pay their contractors while they are out sick during this pandemic.\"", "According to Amazon's announcement, the Amazon Relief Fund will provide their delivery partners and drivers \"the ability to apply for grants approximately equal to up to two-weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon.\"", "Additionally, the statement reads, \"this fund will support our employees and contractors around the world who face financial hardships from other qualifying events, such as a natural disaster, federally declared emergency, or unforeseen personal hardship. Applicants can apply and receive a personal grant from the fund ranging from $400 to $5,000 USD per person.\" The company also announced it is offering unlimited unpaid time off for hourly staff during the month of March.", "Whether or not Amazon actively solicited donations, the original wording on its Amazon Relief Fund page did call for individuals to donate to the fund. Even though the wording has been updated to state explicitly that no donations from the public are expected, a \"Donate\" button still exists on the page, which could be interpreted as an invitation to do so. We therefore rate this claim \"True.\"", "Legum, Judd. \u00a0 \"Amazon Soliciting Public Donations to Pay Workers' Sick Leave.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Popular Information.\u00a024 March 2020.", "Galetti, Beth. \u00a0 \"COVID-19 Update: More Ways Amazon Is Supporting Employees and Contractors.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 DayOne, the Amazon blog.\u00a011 March 2020.", "Palmer, Annie. \u00a0 \"Amazon Launches $25 Million Relief Fund for Delivery Drivers and Seasonal Employees Amid Coronavirus Outbreak.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNBC. \u00a0 11 March 2020.", "Greene, Jaye. \u00a0 \"Amazon Workers Test Positive for Covid-19 at 10 U.S. Warehouses.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Post.\u00a025 March 2020.", "[CORRECTION 03/25/20]: A previous version of this article erroneously stated that Amazon was offering \"unlimited paid time off\" to hourly staff during the month of March; that has been corrected to \"unlimited unpaid time off.\"", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to government to national politics.
