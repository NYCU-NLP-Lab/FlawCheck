The \u2018Murder Hornet\u2019 comes from Japan and East Asia. The group of hornets consists of a queen and a number of worker flies. They can travel more than half a dozen miles in search of food. Hornets like to eat many kinds of insects but specifically enjoy feasting on bees. These insects are nearly two inches in length, the world\u2019s largest wasps. They can decimate beehives in minutes. Researchers say that if the Asian hornet bites a person about 50 times or fewer, the person can die of kidney damage. Every year in Japan, 30 to 50 people die from the sting of these hornets. In 2013, when populations of the hornets were unusually high, they killed 42 people in a single Chinese province.", "\u201cAs of now, researchers can\u2019t confirm how the hornets arrived. Looney says it\u2019s most likely they got accidentally trapped in shipping containers from one of the countries where they\u2019re native,\u201d reads the article. Chris Looney is an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture. At the end of 2019, a whole hive of hornets was found in Nanaimo, Canada, and destroyed. Looney says if the hornets are not stopped in the next few years, it will be very difficult to curb their growth.", "In this report, we will fact-check all the three videos one by one.", "Video 1: Mouse and insect", "Searching on YouTube with the keywords \u2018mouse and wasp\u2019, we found the same video uploaded on July 14, 2018.
