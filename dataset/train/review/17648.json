["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on July 16, 2020", "During his July 14 press conference from the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump made the outdated claim that U.S. deaths from COVID-19 are down \u201ctenfold.\u201d", "Data from three different sources show that, as of July 14, the total number, and seven-day average, of daily deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus had declined between threefold and fourfold from its peak more than two months ago.", "Trump made the claim as he argued that news organizations have recently highlighted record increases in cases of the disease in several states, rather than focusing on the fact that deaths from COVID-19 have declined from their previous high.", "Trump, July 14: And when I turn on the news, I see, \u201ccases, cases, cases.\u201d They don\u2019t talk about deaths being cut down to a level that \u2014 actually, \u201ctenfold,\u201d they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets \u2014 \u201cTenfold.\u201d Cut tenfold. Yes, but they don\u2019t talk about that; they talk about cases.", "Trump\u2019s \u201cvery respected\u201d source appears to be the Washington Times, which was merely quoting his press secretary. We searched the Nexis news database and couldn\u2019t find any other news organization using the \u201ctenfold\u201d language.", "On July 7, Trump tweeted about a Washington Times article that quoted White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying, in a July 6 press briefing, that there had been a \u201ctenfold\u201d decrease in deaths.", "\u201cThe president is not downplaying the severity of the virus,\u201d McEnany said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about Trump\u2019s false claim that \u201c99%\u201d of COVID-19 cases \u201care totally harmless.\u201d She explained: \u201cWhat the president is noting is that at the height of this pandemic we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where on July 4 there were 254. That\u2019s a tenfold decrease in mortality.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know where McEnany got those figures; the White House didn\u2019t tell us.", "The data aggregation website Worldometer reports that there were 2,748 coronavirus-related deaths on April 21 \u2014 at the peak \u2014 and 265 deaths on July 4. Those aren\u2019t the same totals McEnany cited \u2014 but it was a tenfold decrease, as she said.", "However, daily deaths have increased in the days since \u2014 including in Arizona, California, Florida, South Carolina and Texas \u2014 meaning Trump\u2019s \u201ctenfold\u201d talking point is stale.", "On July 14, the day of Trump\u2019s press conference, there were 935 deaths, according to Worldometer. That\u2019s only a threefold decrease from the number of deaths on April 21.", "Slightly different totals from two other sources also show less of a decline in daily deaths than Trump claimed.", "There was a high of 2,752 deaths on April 15 and a total of 954 deaths on July 14, according to the New York Times. That\u2019s a threefold decrease, as well.", "In addition, the COVID Tracking Project reports that there were 736 deaths on July 14, which would be a nearly fourfold decrease from the peak of 2,742 deaths it reports for May 7. We have included a chart of that website\u2019s totals to better illustrate how the number of daily deaths has changed over time. (Scroll to the right to see the full chart.)", "There also hasn\u2019t been a tenfold decline in the seven-day average of deaths, which accounts for fluctuations in daily totals over a full week.", "Here are those averages at their high point, and on July 14, according to Worldometer, the New York Times and the COVID Tracking Project.", "Each source shows a decline of less than fourfold over those time periods.", "Trump does have a point that daily deaths from COVID-19 \u201care way down\u201d from their previous highs, as Trump noted in a July 9 interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show. The president claimed a \u201ctenfold\u201d decrease in \u201cmortality\u201d then, too. But on July 9, the number of daily deaths was already higher than it had been over the July 4 weekend.", "And on July 14, it also was no longer the case that deaths had been \u201ccut tenfold,\u201d which is what Trump said in the Rose Garden. He has simply ignored the increases in daily deaths that have occurred since July 4.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
