Ted Cruz attacked frontrunner Donald Trump for his position on health care.", "\"For decades, Donald has been advocating socialized medicine,\" Cruz said. \"What he said is the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care. And in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless.\"", "Did Trump actually say that about socialized medicine? In a Republican debate?", "No.", "We looked at the transcripts going back a couple of months to the debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. We found Trump never used those words, nor anything close to them.", "There was an exchange in the Feb. 6 debate in Manchester, N.H., when socialized medicine came up, but it didn\u2019t happen the way Cruz said.", "A question from panelist Mary Katherine Ham started the exchange.", "Ham: \"Mr. Trump, you have said you want to repeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, \u2018Everybody\u2019s got to be covered,\u2019 adding, quote, \u2018The government\u2019s going to pay for it.\u2019 Are you closer to Bernie Sanders\u2019 vision for health care than Hillary Clinton\u2019s?\"", "Trump: \"I don\u2019t think I am. I think I\u2019m closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. We\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better.\"", "Trump talked with ABC moderator Martha Raddatz at the same debate about increasing competition among private insurance companies and he praised health savings accounts. He finished his answer this way:", "Trump: \"What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don\u2019t want that to happen. We\u2019re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else, and we\u2019re going to take care of those people.", "\"And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree, you\u2019re not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.\"", "Raddatz: \"Sen. Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you\u2019ve got, quote, \u2018no heart.\u2019 There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama\u2019s broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan \u2014 change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it. How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?\"", "Cruz: \"Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing.\"", "For the record, in the Dec. 15, 2015, debate, Trump called the country\u2019s health care a \"disaster. In the Jan. 14, 2016, debate, Trump said, \"Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it.\"", "Government\u2019s role", "Cruz also asserted that Trump had said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care.", "We asked the Cruz campaign for their sources and didn\u2019t hear back. But in an interview on CBS News\u2019 60 Minutes in September 2015, Trump did say, \"Everybody's got to be covered.\"", "However, in context he was talking about people who don\u2019t make enough money to pay for insurance. Asked what he would do and who would pay, Trump said, \"I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people (and) the government's gonna pay for it.\"", "It\u2019s clear from the full interview that Trump did not say that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care. He made that point again in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 31, 2016, saying that Cruz\u2019s attacks showed \"maybe he\u2019s got no heart.\"", "Back in 1999, Trump did support a single-payer health care system for America. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, he said, \"We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\"", "Trump does not hold that belief today.", "Our ruling", "Cruz said that Trump said in a recent debate that \"if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless.\" Trump did not say those words, or anything like them, in any recent debate.", "He advanced the idea of more competition among private insurance companies, and he said that government should take care of those who can\u2019t afford insurance.", "While there was a time in the past when Trump supported a single-payer plan, there\u2019s no substance to Cruz\u2019s statement.
