A few paragraphs at the bottom of the story offer a favorable opinion about the order and some incorrect information about welfare enrollment.", "For example, it says: \u201cfederal government assistance benefits are being used at an all-time high,\u201d then it goes on to claim that enrollment of \u201cabled-bodied individuals\u201d in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was 16 million in 2016 and that the number has increased since then. Neither of those things is true.", "According to data from the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, the number of \u201cable-bodied adults without dependents\u201d collecting food benefits in fiscal year 2016 was 3.8 million, a number that had been declining since fiscal year 2014.", "That follows the trend for SNAP enrollment as a whole, which has also been declining since fiscal year 2014. We wrote more about that in a recent story\u00a0on how many beneficiaries left the rolls in Trump\u2019s first year in office.", "Updated, July 24: After we posted our story, Right Wing News labeled its piece \u201copinion\u201d and removed a section on SNAP enrollment that it agreed was incorrect.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Trump, Donald J.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
