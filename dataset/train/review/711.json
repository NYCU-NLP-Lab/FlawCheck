This report said that the woman was a victim of domestic violence and identified her as Sumaiya Hassan from Dhaka, Bangladesh. On June 26, 2020, she had shared a few pictures on Facebook showing her injuries. In the post, she accused her husband and in-laws of beating her for dowry. Taking cognizance of Sumaiya\u2019s post, the in-charge of Dhaka\u2019s Shahbagh police station questioned Sumaiya\u2019s husband Zahid Hassan. According to the police, Sumaiya and Zahid had gotten married a few years ago. They were facing marital problems and Sumaiya had filed a complaint against her in-laws earlier. However, the family later sorted the issue amongst themselves.", "One of the other photos of her was included in a different article by the Dhaka Tribune on June 27, 2020. According to the report, she had posted six pictures on Facebook on June 26. Within a few hours, her post became viral. She claimed that her husband and brother-in-law were both drug addicts. Sumaiya also claimed that she was afraid of speaking out because her in-laws had threatened to kill her younger brother. The report mentioned that the police had arrested Zahid. Abdurrahim, Sumaiya\u2019s father-in-law, denied allegations of the family\u2019s involvement. He said that Zahid used to beat Sumaiya and other family members had nothing to do with the domestic abuse. The report does not suggest that Sumaiya was a Muslim convert.", "The photos had been shared from Sumaiya\u2019s personal Facebook account, which she later deleted with an explanation. She wrote that many people who were concerned about her did not know that the issue had been resolved. She then requested people not to further share the images. She said that the police had asked her to file a complaint in the matter. However, she told the police that she did not want to register a case. Sumaiya instead chose to reconcile with her husband keeping in mind their 8-month old baby\u2019s future.", "Plz sobai shere kore den amn onk a jne na j amr problem thik hoise", "Amar facebook status dekhe police bishoyti amole\u2026", "Posted by Sumaiya Hassan on Saturday, 27 June 2020", "In one of Sumaiya\u2019s posts on Facebook, she is in the same clothes spotted in the viral pictures.", "Therefore, images of a domestic violence victim from Bangladesh were shared as India.
