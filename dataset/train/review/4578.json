["By Robert Farley", "Posted on February 11, 2020", "Former Vice President Joe Biden wrongly claimed President Donald Trump has \u201cyet once to condemn white supremacy, the neo-Nazis.\u201d", "Trump drew criticism for his condemnation of \u201chatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\u201d after a rally organized by a white nationalist in Charlottesville in 2017, and for saying there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d But, contrary to Biden\u2019s claim, the president twice specifically condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and he has repeated that condemnation since.", "On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Biden was asked what the consequences would be of a Trump victory in 2020. Biden responded that Trump would \u201cgo on dividing us based on race.\u201d", "Biden, Feb. 9: George, I, honest to God believe, they\u2019re going to change the nature of who we are for a long, long time. Our children are listening. The idea \u2014 the man who can belittle people, go on dividing us based on race, religion, ethnicity, based on all the things that, in fact, make up America is just incredibly divisive. You see these white supremacists coming out from under the rocks. He\u2019s yet once to condemn white supremacy, the neo-Nazis. He hasn\u2019t condemned a darn thing. He has given them oxygen. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to continue to happen. That\u2019s who this guy is. He has no basic American values \u2014 he doesn\u2019t understand the American code.", "Biden has said that Trump\u2019s comments in the aftermath of the Charlottesville rally convinced him to run for president. In a video announcing his candidacy, Biden said Trump\u2019s \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d comment \u201cassigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it\u201d and \u201cshocked the conscience of the nation.\u201d", "Trump has said his \u201cvery fine people\u201d comment referred not to white supremacists and neo-Nazis but to \u201cpeople that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee \u2014 a great general, whether you like it or not.\u201d Some have argued that explanation doesn\u2019t hold up, because Trump referred in that statement to a protest \u201cthe night before\u201d when \u2014 it was widely reported \u2014 white nationalists burned tiki torches and chanted anti-Semitic and white nationalist slogans. We\u2019ll leave it to readers to make up their minds on Trump\u2019s remarks, but Biden\u2019s comment that Trump has \u201cyet once to condemn white supremacy\u201d is not accurate.", "Let\u2019s revisit Trump\u2019s comments in the days after the Charlottesville rally. That rally turned violent, and one person, Heather Heyer,\u00a0was killed\u00a0and many others injured, when a man with a history of making racist comments plowed his car into a group of counterprotesters.", "The day of that incident Trump said, \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides.\u201d Trump said he had spoken to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and \u201cwe agreed that the hate and the division must stop, and must stop right now. We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation and true affection \u2014 really \u2014 and I say this so strongly \u2014 true affection for each other.\u201d", "Two days later, on Aug. 14, 2017, Trump issued a statement from the White House, and referred to \u201cKKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 14, 2017: As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.", "And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.", "Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.", "We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.", "During a press conference the following day, Aug. 15, 2017, Trump explained his initial \u201cmany sides\u201d comment.", "\u201cYou had a group on one side that was bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you had a group on the other side that was also very violent.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve condemned neo-Nazis. I\u2019ve condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the relevant portion when the president said some in the group protesting the removal of the Lee statue were \u201cvery fine people\u201d:", "Reporter, Aug. 15, 2017:\u00a0You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides \u2026", "Trump:\u00a0Well, I do think there\u2019s blame \u2013 yes, I think there\u2019s blame on both sides. You look at, you look at both sides. I think there\u2019s blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don\u2019t have any doubt about it either. And, and, and, and if you reported it accurately, you would say.", "Reporter:\u00a0The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. \u2026", "Trump:\u00a0Excuse me, they didn\u2019t put themselves down as neo \u2014 and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group \u2013 excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. \u2026", "It\u2019s fine, you\u2019re changing history, you\u2019re changing culture, and you had people \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally \u2013 but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats \u2013 you had a lot of bad people in the other group too.", "Reporter:\u00a0I just didn\u2019t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? \u2026", "Trump: No, no. There were people in that rally, and I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly, the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I\u2019m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest, because you know, I don\u2019t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn\u2019t have a permit. So I only tell you this: There are two sides to a story.", "So, contrary to Biden\u2019s claim that Trump has \u201cyet once to condemn white supremacy, the neo-Nazis,\u201d in the course of two days, Trump did it twice.", "Trump, Aug. 14, 2017: Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.", "Trump, Aug. 15, 2017: I\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.", "Nor was that the last time Trump condemned white supremacy by name.", "After nearly two dozen people were killed on Aug. 3, 2019, in a shooting at a Wal-Mart in El Paso, Trump said: \u201cThe shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism \u2014 whatever they need.\u201d", "Biden said that since Trump took office, \u201cYou see these white supremacists coming out from under the rocks.\u201d Last March, we looked into that issue, and experts told us there are a number of indicators that suggest white nationalism and white supremacy \u2014 and violence inspired by them \u2014 are on the rise, in the U.S. and around the world.", "It\u2019s Biden\u2019s opinion that Trump\u2019s comments have \u201cgiven them oxygen,\u201d as he said. But Biden went too far when he said Trump has \u201cyet once to condemn white supremacy, the neo-Nazis. He hasn\u2019t condemned a darn thing.\u201d He has, although perhaps not as often or as quickly as Biden would like.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
