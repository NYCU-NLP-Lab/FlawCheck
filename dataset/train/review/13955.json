Twice in two months, Turner singled out one of Houston\u2019s major highways.", "At a March 4, 2016, press conference, Turner said: \"The Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world, with up to 26 lanes including frontage road lanes.\" Turner went on to hammer that an expansion of I-10 that finished in 2008 still left drivers sitting in traffic during peak drive times, saying cities should consider other methods to control congestion beyond expansion.", "Houston\u2019s 14 expressways are all big, of course. But is the Katy Freeway really the widest on the planet?", "For starters, the mayor counting main lanes along with frontage roads to judge width struck us as unusual. To our inquiry, Brad Eaves, principal at the Houston firm TEI, agreed, saying that from a traffic standpoint, he\u2019d consider main lanes of a freeway and the frontage roads separately since each one serves a different function: Main lanes are high-speed, long-trip roadways while frontage roads serve a purpose that\u2019s a little different. While he\u2019s heard this stat before, since he\u2019s \"obviously not familiar with every freeway in the world,\" he could not confirm whether Turner\u2019s claim is true or not.", "We could have wandered many ways to check this claim.", "For starters, a Google search of \"widest freeway in the world\" pulled up more than 92,000 results.

The freeway alone is 13 lanes at its widest, with most sections consisting of 10 to 12 lanes, Doug Hecox, a public affairs specialist with the Federal Highway Administration, told us via email. The FHWA uses the Highway Performance Monitoring System, a database that collects information on the nation\u2019s public roads. Congress uses data from the system in reports that determine highway funding, and states and local governments use data to assess everything from highway condition to air quality trends.", "We\u2019d reached out to the agency to gauge how I-10 compares in width to other major U.S. roadways -- never mind highways of the world. When comparing freeway lanes alone, I-10 doesn\u2019t appear to be especially wide. In fact, as of July 2010, at least eight sections of other U.S. freeways had more lanes. A section of I-405 in Los Angeles had 14 freeway lanes, parts of I-75 in Atlanta had 15 lanes, and we spotted stretches of freeway in more than 10 other cities with 12 or 13 lanes. This means, according to the agency, highways in six other states had more lanes than the Katy Freeway.", "Hecox told us the agency doesn\u2019t include frontage roads nor does it have a way to include them.", "And in Canada\u2026", "Considering highways globally starts to make the Katy look picayune.", "As of 2016, for instance, Highway 401 near the Toronto Airport ran 18 lanes across.

Problem is, hardly anyone includes frontage roads when measuring American freeways. Get rid of the frontage roads and the Katy drops to 13 lanes at its widest, not much different than several other freeways across the country.", "As for the rest of the world, we found a wider freeway in Canada, and a reported 50-lane highway in China that makes the Katy look like a country road.", "We rate this claim False.", "FALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "Chart, Federal Highway Administration, Urban Highways with the Most Lanes", "Article, Turner tries to turn a page on Houston transportation, Houston Chronicle, Feb. 3, 2016", "Article, Bragging rights or embarrassment?
