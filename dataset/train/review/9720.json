["By Robert Farley", "Posted on January 30, 2020", "Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg blamed tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump for creating the nation\u2019s debt problem. But while the Congressional Budget Office says those tax cuts are worsening the nation\u2019s debt, spiraling deficits and debt over the next decade were projected even before those tax cuts were enacted.", "Buttigieg\u2019s comments came during a Jan. 28 town hall event in Ottumwa, Iowa, in response to an audience question about what he would do to protect Medicaid and Social Security.", "Buttigieg argued that in the face of soaring debt, Trump \u201cwould have us believe we\u2019ve got no choice but to stop investing in education, infrastructure, health care, you name it, and even to cut Medicaid or Medicare or Social Security.\u201d", "(Trump\u2019s proposed budgets have regularly called for spending cuts to domestic programs, including education and infrastructure, though Congress largely has ignored those requests. As for potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare, Democrats criticized Trump for recently saying he would \u201ctake a look at\u201d spending on \u201centitlements\u201d such as Social Security and Medicare. Trump later tweeted that he would \u201csave\u201d Social Security, although he has offered no plan to do so.)", "\u201cBut how did we get into this debt?\u201d Buttigieg said at the Iowa town hall. \u201cIt\u2019s not the result of some mysterious, cosmic force that nobody could have prevented. It\u2019s the result of giant tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy. I think it\u2019s time for my party to get back on top of owning the issue of the debt, because it seems like we\u2019re the only ones prepared to actually do something about it.\u201d", "Asked for backup, the Buttigieg campaign pointed to two articles that noted Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts have added to the nation\u2019s budget deficits and rising debt. That\u2019s true.", "As we have written, the Congressional Budget Office says the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a\u00a0Republican-crafted tax bill that Trump\u00a0signed\u00a0into law on Dec. 22, 2017, is adding to rising deficits. As Buttigieg said, the law slashed the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It also included a number of individual income tax cuts, and while most Americans at all income levels got a tax break, if those cuts are allowed to expire by 2027, it\u2019s true that most of the benefits in later years would disproportionately go to the wealthiest Americans.", "Some Republicans argued that the tax cuts would pay for themselves \u2014 that lost revenue from tax cuts would be offset by a boost to the economy \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t happened.", "According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis in April 2018, the budget deficit for fiscal year 2018 was about $242 billion higher than CBO had projected the year before. About $163 billion of that additional deficit came as a result of the TCJA, CBO said. Over 10 years, the tax cuts were expected to add a cumulative $1.7 trillion to yearly deficits.", "Still, the tax cuts aren\u2019t entirely to blame for the higher-than-projected deficits under Trump.", "As the CBO analysis indicates, while about two-thirds of the additional deficit in FY2018 was tied to the tax cuts, additional spending \u2014\u00a0 particularly on defense \u2014 also played a role. According to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published on Dec. 31, the 2017 tax cuts combined with increased spending will more than double deficits in the next two years.", "But it\u2019s also important to note that deficits were expected to rise dramatically over the next decade even before the tax cuts were proposed.", "After the deficit hit a record-high $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009 during the Great Recession, yearly deficits under President Barack Obama declined markedly for several years. In fiscal year 2015, the deficit was $438 billion, a drop of 69% from fiscal 2009.", "But, as we wrote in our final installment of Obama\u2019s Numbers, deficits were again on the rise as Obama left office.", "At around the time Trump took office in January 2017, CBO estimated that the deficit for fiscal 2017 would increase to $559 billion. At the time, the CBO also projected that under then current law \u2014 nearly a year before Trump\u00a0signed the tax cut legislation \u2014 annual deficits would again exceed $1 trillion in 2023 and beyond. At that time, the CBO projected that federal debt owed to the public would reach nearly 79% of gross domestic product in 2020, and 90% in 2027.", "By July 2017, CBO had revised its deficit projection for fiscal year 2017 upward to $693 billion without the tax cut law, which was months away from becoming law.", "As we said, the Trump tax cuts have added to those projected deficits. The most recent budget projection from CBO, published on Jan. 28, presents an even more dire picture of rising deficits and public debt than the projection did last year.", "CBO, Jan. 28: In CBO\u2019s baseline, after accounting for all of the government\u2019s borrowing needs, debt held by the public rises from $17.9\u00a0trillion at the end of 2020 to $31.4\u00a0trillion at the end of 2030 (see Table 1-2). As a percentage of GDP, that debt would increase from 81 percent at the end of 2020 to 98 percent by the end of the projection period. At that point, such debt would be the largest since 1946 and more than twice the average over the past 50 years.", "The outlook beyond the next 10 years \u201cis daunting,\u201d CBO said. \u201cBy 2050, debt is projected to reach 180 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), far higher than any percentage previously recorded in the United States and on track to grow even larger.\u201d", "The tax cuts enacted by Trump are contributing to that debt, but less and less as a percentage over time. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explains, that\u2019s because \u201ca large portion of the tax cuts are scheduled to expire and spending on health and retirement programs will continue to outpace revenue.\u201d", "\u201cNear-term deficits are driven in large part by legislation enacted since 2015 and especially since 2017 [including the TCJA but also higher spending bills]\u201d Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us via email. \u201cBut long-term debt will continue to rise regardless due to the growing costs of health and retirement costs and the lack of revenue to finance those costs. Even if we reverse all the tax cuts and spending increases enacted since 2015, we\u2019ll still have to do more to put the debt on a sustainable long-term trajectory.\u201d", "To that end, we should note that Buttigieg has suggested raising the cap on earnings that are subject to the Social Security payroll tax. Currently, the Social Security tax is imposed on earnings up to $132,900.", "At an AARP candidate forum this past July, Buttigieg said Social Security isn\u2019t sustainable \u201cwithout some adjustments\u201d to the program. \u201cFor example, if we just elevated the cap on the level of income eligible for payroll taxes from $135,000 to the $250,000 neighborhood that would go a long way toward sustainability,\u201d he said.", "The Buttigieg campaign describes the candidate\u2019s plan to increase Social Security payroll tax revenue this way: \u201cIndividual wage earnings above $250,000 (which means family wage earnings above $500,000 for equal-earning couples) will face additional Social Security taxes and earn modest Social Security benefits for their extra contributions. Individuals earning less than $250,000 will not be affected.\u201d", "We take no position on Buttigieg\u2019s Social Security plan, and he has a point that the tax cuts signed into law has added to federal deficits. However, he goes too far when he says the debt is \u201cthe result\u201d of Republican tax cuts.", "Updated, Jan. 30: We added some details on Buttigieg\u2019s plan to increase Social Security payroll tax revenue.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
