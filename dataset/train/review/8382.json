(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)", "During his run for California governor, Republican John Cox has tried to tie Democrat Gavin Newsom to the state\u2019s growing homeless problem. In Cox\u2019s latest radio campaign ad, a narrator even uses \"Newsomville\" to describe the state\u2019s homeless camps \"springing up in every town.\"", "At Monday\u2019s gubernatorial debate, Cox attacked Newsom over San Francisco\u2019s struggle with this human crisis.", "\"Gavin was mayor (of San Francisco) for eight years. He didn\u2019t solve the homeless problem here at all. And it\u2019s gotten worse.\"", "We wanted to know whether Cox was right. Did Newsom really fail to \"solve the problem at all\"? And has it \"gotten worse\"?", "We set out on a fact check.", "Our research", "Newsom\u00a0was San Francisco\u2019s mayor from January 2004 to January 2011. He has served as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor for the past seven-plus years. Few big city mayors in the United States, if any, have completely solved homelessness during their tenures.", "For his part, Newsom has often pointed to his role in cutting San Francisco\u2019s \"street population by 40 percent\" during his time as mayor, adding his administration \"got 12,000 people off the street.\" His campaign has cited the 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey to support that statement.", "We examined that claim in May and rated it Half True. We found Newsom cherry-picked the timeframe of this reduction, which took place from 2002 to 2009, two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office.", "The street population went back up by 400 during his final two years. But even considering that uptick, the city\u2019s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011", "RELATED:\u00a0Fact check round-up of California governor's debate", "Tracking San Francisco's overall homeless population", "We also noted that Newsom\u2019s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco\u2019s overall homeless population during his time as mayor.

By January 2011, Newsom\u2019s final month in office, that number was 6,455.", "San Francisco\u2019s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at 7,499. That\u2019s 1,044 higher than Newsom\u2019s final month as mayor, and generally supports the last portion of Cox\u2019s statement that the problem has \"gotten worse.\"", "Newsom credited as leader", "While the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article said Newsom had \"moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city's history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score.\"", "Newsom\u2019s campaign pointed a 2016 Chronicle investigation Beyond Homelessness, which examined the city\u2019s response to the issue over the past two decades.", "Here\u2019s what the newspaper found:", "\"Gavin Newsom, took the most aggressive stance yet toward tackling the issue. In 2004, he announced a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.", "While it failed to reach that goal, it did result in moving 22,000 homeless people off the streets either into housing or onto buses headed home. And in the past few years, the majority of the city\u2019s indigent military veterans \u2014 many suffering post-traumatic stress from as far back as the 1970s \u2014 have been moved indoors, thanks in part to a national effort led by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.", "And yet the city\u2019s streets look the same today.", "\"There\u2019s a mythology that you can, quote unquote, end homelessness at any moment,\" Newsom said in 2014. \u00a0\"But there are new people coming in, suffering through the cycles of their lives. It\u2019s the manifestation of complete, abject failure as a society. We\u2019ll never solve this at City Hall.\"", "The city\u2019s bus ticket program, Homeward Bound, which accounts for sending thousands of homeless out of San Francisco, has been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem elsewhere.", "Asked to support Cox\u2019s claim, his spokesman responded in an email: \"Wait, is there not a homeless problem in SF?\"", "Our ruling", "Republican John Cox claimed Gavin Newsom \"didn\u2019t solve the homeless problem\" in San Francisco \"at all,\" adding \"it\u2019s gotten worse.\"", "Under Newsom\u2019s administration, San Francisco\u2019s homeless street population fell by 31 percent, from 2002 to 2011.
