California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes, and Washington state passed a bill to establish paid maternity leave but later reversed course.", "Additionally, some employers offer paid maternity leave even though it\u2019s not required.

Temporary workers do not receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don\u2019t receive maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don\u2019t get any in Japan.
