["The post was published to Facebook by a New Zealand-based user here on August 26, 2020. It has been shared more than 380 times.", "The images featured in the post show a photo of a bee and a drawing of a one.", "Underneath the images is\u00a0a caption that reads: \u201cBumblebees do not fly. While it appears they do, what is actually being witnessed is something called \u2018acoustic levitation\u2019. Inside a bumblebee there is a hollow cavity next to the larynx. When they beat their wings, they begin resonating energy within this cavity. Once that resonance matches the 7.83Hz of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, it becomes a free-agent surrounded in an electromagnetic envelope, enabling levitation.\u201d", "The claim was also shared hundreds of times here, here, here, and\u00a0here\u00a0on Facebook.", "However, the claim is false.", "According to biologists at Arizona State University (ASU) in the US, bees can fly because their wings \u201cmake short, quick sweeping motions\u201d that generate enough lift to propel them through the air -- not because of \u201cacoustic levitation\u201d.", "\u201cTheir wings are not rigid, but twist and rotate during flight. Bee wings make short, quick sweeping motions front and back. This motion creates enough lift to make it possible for bees to fly,\u201d the ASU article reads.", "In 2005, scientists at the California University of Technology in the US\u00a0determined that the movement of bees\u2019 wings creates an aerodynamic phenomenon called \u201cleading edge vortices\u201d, which creates pressure differentials that allow\u00a0certain animals to fly.", "The researchers also found that the wingbeat frequency of bees is roughly 230Hz, or 230 cycles per minute. The determination is far greater than the 7.83Hz claimed in the false Facebook post.", "\u201cOur analysis of honeybee aerodynamics reveals how the rapid low-amplitude wing motion of bees is sufficient to maintain the weight of the animal,\u201d the study reads.", "While bees don\u2019t use \u201cacoustic levitation,\u201d scientists have previously suspended small objects\u00a0mid-air using the phenomenon, which uses soundwaves to counteract gravity.", "According to this article published by the US Department of Energy Argonne Laboratory,\u00a0an \u201cacoustic levitator\u201d uses speakers to generate soundwaves that interfere with each other and create a standing wave.", "\u201cAt certain points along a standing wave, known as nodes, there is no net transfer of energy at all. Because the acoustic pressure from the sound waves is sufficient to cancel the effect of gravity, light objects are able to levitate when placed at the nodes,\u201d the article reads.", "A demonstration of acoustic levitation from the Argonne Laboratory can be seen here\u00a0on its YouTube channel.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
