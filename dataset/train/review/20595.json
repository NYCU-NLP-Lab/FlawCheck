Bush, the former Texas governor, saying \"family values do not stop at the Rio Grande\u2026 People are coming to our country to do jobs that Americans won\u2019t do to be able to feed their families. And I think there\u2019s a humane way to recognize that, at the same time protect our borders,\" Bush said, \"and at the same way to make sure we don\u2019t disadvantage those who have stood in line for years to become a legal citizen.\"", "Todd asked: \"Do you agree with that statement?\"", "Abbott replied: \"In a way I understand this even more powerfully because my wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas. And Texas has had a long tradition of uniting the Hispanic culture with Texas values.\"", "Abbott, the state attorney general, talked up his wife making history for months on the campaign trail in 2014, perhaps to good effect. In July 2014, PolitiFact Texas found the state\u2019s population was 38.4 percent Hispanic, the second biggest demographic after whites, who make up 40 percent. Notably too, the flags that have flown over Texas include the banners of Spain and Mexico.", "And has there previously not been a Hispanic first lady of Texas?

According to Ancestry.com, Phalen is an Irish family name, most common in the state of New York.", "Next, we turned to how best to define an Hispanic first lady.", "What\u2019s Hispanic?", "By phone, Erika Arredondo-Haskins of the Hispanic Heritage Center of Texas in San Antonio, told us the word \"Hispanic\" describes anyone who can trace ancestry to Spanish culture, including through the Spanish colonies in the Americas that once stretched from California to the southern tip of South America.", "Also, Haskins suggested, Texas history predates statehood and its earlier status as as a free-standing republic to when the region was ruled by Mexico and, before that, Spain and there were numerous Hispanic first ladies. She singled out Maria Perez Cassiano, wife of the governor of the Spanish province Coahuila and Texas from 1814 to 1823. Cassiano was born in San Antonio in 1790, descended from Spanish immigrants who arrived in San Antonio in 1731, and was known for performing the governor\u2019s duties in his absence, Haskins said.", "Haskins\u2019 comments reminded us of a complicating detail: Texas fell under various successive governments since Europeans arrived in the 1500s--it\u2019s been a province of New Spain, a Mexican province, a republic, a U.S. state and a Confederate state.", "According to Texas A&M University\u2019s \"Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas,\" a Texas history research group, there were 29 governors of Texas from 1691 to 1821. Among first ladies in that period, Augustina Cant\u00fa was the wife of Alonso de Leon, the first governor of Texas who established the state\u2019s modern eastern border at the Sabine River, according to the Handbook of Texas, a project of the Texas State Historical Association.

She also recommended we visit the Legislative Reference Library at the Texas Capitol for a full answer.", "At the library, we reviewed the book First Ladies of Texas, which includes biographies of Texas first ladies, born between 1836 and 1936, of the Republic of Texas, the state of Texas, and the Confederate state of Texas. (Texas became a state in 1845.) None of the 37 first ladies listed in the book had roots in former Spanish colonies. Most came from southeastern states of the United States (interestingly, less than half were born in Texas).", "Four recent first ladies dwelt in the governor\u2019s mansion after the book\u2019s publication in 1976--Rita Crocker Clements, Linda Gale White, Laura Welch Bush and Anita Thigpen Perry.
