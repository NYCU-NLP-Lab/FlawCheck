Scott Walker often cites how he faced 100,000 protesters who fought unsuccessfully to stop \u00a0Act 10, the 2011 collective bargaining reform law that led to his historic recall election.", "But sometimes the Wisconsin Republican goes further \u2014\u00a0suggesting that the throngs of pro-union demonstrators had been imported.", "That's what happened July 27, 2015, when Fox News talk show host Neil Cavuto asked Walker what he thought about a commentary by syndicated Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank.", "In the column, Milbank said Walker has a \"technique of scapegoating unions for the nation\u2019s ills\" that is similar to techniques of the late Joe McCarthy, the Communist-hunting U.S. senator from Wisconsin.", "Walker began his response to Cavuto by saying:", "\"Well, in the end, I\u2019m used to -- you know, you\u2019ve been up to Wisconsin, you\u2019ve seen it firsthand.
