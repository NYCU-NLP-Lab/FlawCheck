["Did you get the chain email that claims the health care law will institute a new tax on home sales?\n\nHere\u2019s the email many readers have forwarded to us:\n\n\"Under the new health care bill \u2014 did you know that all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax? The bulk of these new taxes don\u2019t kick in until 2013 (presumably after Obama\u2019s re-election). You can thank Nancy, Harry and Barack and your local Democrat Congressman for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Is this Hope & Change great or what? \u2026\n\n\"Oh, you weren\u2019t aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren\u2019t alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren\u2019t aware of it either (result of clandestine midnight voting for huge bills they\u2019ve never read). AND, there are a few other surprises lurking.\"\n\nThe email\u2019s claims are wrong, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from pressing the forward button. We\u2019ve received copies of this email regularly since 2010. We\u2019ve debunked it before, but since it\u2019s still out there, we\u2019re going to review the facts again now.\n\nThe distortion sprouted from Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled \"Unearned income Medicare contribution.\" Legislative wonks might remember that this was the second part of the health care bill, passed via reconciliation so that it only required 50 votes. Democrats had to do it that way after they lost their 60-seat majority due to a special election for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.\n\nIt is a new tax, but it\u2019s not on real estate transactions. Let us explain.\n\nRight now, workers pay Medicare hospital taxes on wages. Workers and employers split a 2.9 percent tax; the self-employed pay all of it.\n\nThe health care law imposes a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income, but it only applies to couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. That investment income could include the profits from real estate transactions.\n\nBut it would only apply to those high earners, who make up less than 5 percent of all taxpayers.\nThe new tax marks the first time investment income will be subject to Medicare taxes, said Clint Stretch, the managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP, when we asked him about in 2010.\n\nWe should point out that the government currently taxes investment income in various ways and could have simply raised current rates.\n\nBut lawmakers wanted to link the new revenues to health care, Stretch said. \"The point of doing it as a Medicare tax was to have the money go to the Medicare trust fund and have it act like a tax that is paying for health care. So there is additional complexity,\" he said.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why the email extrapolates this tax to all real estate transactions, but that\u2019s the only 3.8 percent tax we could find in the new law. We ran this by two tax policy experts who confirmed our analysis.\n\nIf you\u2019re an empty-nester of any means, and you\u2019re thinking of downsizing, part of your profits are already tax-free thanks to long-standing tax exemptions on the profits from home sales.\n\nIn general, if you sell your own home, individuals are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit and married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit. Again, that\u2019s profit, not the sales price.\n\nIf you\u2019re wealthy and sell your home at a substantial profit, it\u2019s possible you might get hit with the new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Most Americans won\u2019t have to worry about this, though.\n\nThe chain email doesn\u2019t acknowledge any of those pesky facts. It says that a 3.8 percent tax applies to all real estate transactions as a sales tax. That is not the case. The email seems intended to scare people, particularly older Americans thinking of downsizing.
