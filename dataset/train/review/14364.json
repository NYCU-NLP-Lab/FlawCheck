However, of the information that has emerged about her testimony and reported by the mainstream media, none of it indicated she blamed the Chinese.", "Conservative news outlets included Breitbart and The Daily Caller said that lawmakers indicated Page contradicted Strzok about their texts and focused on the issue of political bias at the FBI, but those articles didn\u2019t indicate that she blamed China, either.", "The Washington Post reported that Republican lawyers said that Page provided new information that further convinced them that political bias marred the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Page denied bias.", "Several right-wing websites have repeated the claim that Page contradicted the U.S. intelligence community and pointed the finger at China.
