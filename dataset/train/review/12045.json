It also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.", "It is true that all income groups, on average, saw an income tax cut under Trump\u2019s tax cuts, and\u00a082% of middle-income earners \u2014 those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000 \u2014 received a tax cut that averaged about $1,050 in 2018, according to an\u00a0analysis by the Tax Policy Center\u00a0at the time.", "But the Tax Policy Center also found that\u00a0the top 1% of taxpayers would receive 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018 \u2014\u00a0increasing\u00a0to 25.3% in 2025 and then jumping to 82.8% in 2027.

Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who\u00a0chairs\u00a0the House subcommittee on government operations, which includes oversight of the postal service. Instead, the CARES Act provided USPS with $10 billion in borrowing authority, giving the Treasury Department\u00a0leverage\u00a0to negotiate changes at the postal service, including cutting labor costs, as first outlined in a\u00a02018 task force report.", "In May, the House Democrats tried again,\u00a0passing\u00a0the\u00a0Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions,\u00a0or HEROES Act, which\u00a0included $25 billion\u00a0for the postal service.", "Trump\u00a0recently disclosed\u00a0that he opposes giving the postal service $25 billion because of his opposition to mail-in voting, saying if the postal service doesn\u2019t get the emergency funds \u201cthat means you can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting because they\u2019re not equipped to have it.\u201d", "In addition, Louis DeJoy \u2014\u00a0a Trump ally and donor\u00a0\u2014 took over as postmaster general in\u00a0mid-June\u00a0and began instituted\u00a0cost-cutting initiatives, including reducing overtime. Those initiative have now been\u00a0put on hold\u00a0until after the election, due to Democratic concerns that such measures will delay the prompt delivery of mail-in ballots by the Nov. 3 election.", "In response to Trump\u2019s opposition to USPS funding and mail-in ballots, as well as DeJoy\u2019s operational changes, the House Democrats\u00a0passed standalone legislation\u00a0on Aug. 22 to provide the U.S. Postal Service with $25 billion in emergency funding.

We have it down to two years now, we\u2019re going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we\u2019re going to know it very quickly. We\u2019re not going to take 17 years. \u2026 They took forever.", "Although there have been some exceptions, the median wait time to get permit approval has never been nearly as high as the president claimed. According to Federal Highway Administration data, the median wait time between fiscal years 1999 and 2016 ranged from 3.4 years to 7 years. After the method for tracking wait times was revised starting in fiscal 2012, the median wait time during the last five years of the Obama administration was 43.6 months, or 3.63 years.", "That median time has not been trimmed during the Trump years. The median wait time was 46 months in fiscal 2017, 47 months in fiscal 2018 and 46 months in 2019.", "Trump signed an executive order in August 2017 setting a \u201cgoal\u00a0of completing all Federal environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects within 2 years.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t been achieved. As we said, the median wait time in fiscal 2019, the latest year for available data, was 46 months, or 3.83 years.", "Donald Trump Jr. said his father \u201cbuilt the greatest economy our country has ever seen,\u201d which isn\u2019t true.", "Job growth actually slowed\u00a0under Trump.

The best year of Trump\u2019s presidency saw 3% growth in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product, according to recently revised figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That fell short of the 3.1% growth seen as recently as 2015, during then-President Barack Obama\u2019s best year. As recently as 2004 and 2005, under George W. Bush, the economy grew 3.8% and 3.5%.", "Trump Jr. began by saying that until recently the country was seeing the \u201cgreatest prolonged economic expansion in American history.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s true, but the historic boom\u00a0began\u00a0under Obama seven-and-a-half years before Trump took office, in June 2009, and\u00a0ended\u00a0just three years into the Trump presidency, in February 2020.", "The expansion (as determined by the nonpartisan, independent\u00a0National Bureau of Economic Research) lasted 128 months, topping the previous record expansion of 120 months. That one began late in George H. W. Bush\u2019s term, ran the entire eight years of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, and ended two months into the first term of Bush\u2019s son George W. Bush.", "Some speakers falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, even though Biden has explicitly said that he does not. The charges are part of a Trump campaign strategy to suggest that a Biden administration would mean an unsafe America with crime out of control and unanswered 911 calls.", "Trump\u00a0has made\u00a0this false claim many times, as have his\u00a0campaign ads. But as we have\u00a0written, Biden has said on a number of occasions that he is opposed to defunding the police, and a Biden spokesman told us the Democratic nominee supports\u00a0more\u00a0funding for police for some functions, such as initiatives to strengthen community relationships and for body-worn cameras. (As we\u2019ve written, there is no agreed upon definition for the\u00a0term\u00a0\u201cdefund the police.\u201d\u00a0Some critics of the police really do want to abolish police forces and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. Others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies.)", "That didn\u2019t stop speakers from making the untrue statement on the GOP convention opening night. For example, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, who was\u00a0shot\u00a0during a congressional baseball game in 2017, said, \u201cBiden has embraced the left\u2019s insane mission to defund\u201d the police.", "Scalise, Aug. 24:\u00a0The left wants to defund the police. This is personal to me \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be here without the bravery and heroism of the men and women in law enforcement who saved my life. President Trump stands with those brave men and women. Joe Biden has embraced the left\u2019s insane mission to defund them. There won\u2019t be an America to leave to our children and grandchildren without those brave law enforcement officers and first responders.", "And Guilfoyle said Biden, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and \u201cthe rest of the socialists \u2026 will defund, dismantle and destroy America\u2019s law enforcement. When you are in trouble, and need police, don\u2019t count on the Democrats.\u201d", "It\u2019s important to remember that the federal government pays a small percentage of law enforcement expenses.\u00a0According to a\u00a0backgrounder\u00a0by the Urban Institute, 86% of police funding in 2017 was from local governments, with additional money ponied up by state governments.", "And Biden has rejected the idea pushed by some on the left to defund the police. He made his position clear in an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0published in\u00a0USA Today\u00a0on June 10:", "Biden, June 10:\u00a0While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police. The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.", "Nevertheless, Scalise and Guilfoyle weren\u2019t the only speakers to say that Biden would significantly cut spending on law enforcement. Some speakers, like Donald Trump Jr., linked defunding the police to Democrats in general without specifically naming Biden. But Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said that liberal Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and socialists will be \u201cpulling the strings\u201d in a Biden administration.", "Gaetz, Aug. 24: Settle for Biden \u2014 that\u2019s the hashtag promoted by AOC and the socialists.\u00a0The woketopians\u00a0will settle\u00a0for Biden\u00a0because they\u00a0will make him an extra in a movie written and produced and directed by others.

And the\u00a0police aren\u2019t coming when you call in Democrat run cities that are already being defunded, disbanded.", "Despite the fact that it is untrue, it seems clear that the GOP will be pushing this claim deeper into the campaign.", "Two speakers went after Democratic policy positions on the environment, but mischaracterized them.", "\u201cIf you watched the DNC last week, you probably noticed that Democrats spent a lot of time talking about how much they despise our president,\u201c said RNC Chairwoman McDaniel. \u201cBut we heard very little about their actual policies. Policies that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Policies like banning fossil fuels.\u201d", "Haley also made a similar claim, suggesting that a Biden-Harris administration would be controlled by the \u201csocialist left\u201d and would ban\u00a0hydraulic fracturing\u00a0as a method of extracting oil and natural gas.", "\u201cLast time, Joe\u2019s boss was Obama. \u2026 This time, it would be Pelosi, Sanders, and the Squad,\u201d Haley said. \u201cTheir vision for America is socialism. \u2026 They want to ban fracking and kill millions of jobs.\u201d", "While some Democrats support banning fracking,\u00a0including Sen.

Given that most fracking\u00a0occurs\u00a0on private or state-owned land, Biden\u2019s policy is hardly a ban on fracking.", "Biden\u2019s climate plan also doesn\u2019t ban all fossil fuels, although it works to reduce society\u2019s reliance on them, and\u00a0aims for net-zero emissions\u00a0no later than 2050. Net-zero means some emissions can occur, as long as those emissions are sequestered, or removed, and there is no net addition to the atmosphere. In theory, this allows fossil fuels to be used with carbon capture technologies or other sequestration efforts.", "Not even the Green New Deal called for a complete ban on all fossil fuels. Instead, the nonbinding resolution\u00a0proposed\u00a0getting to net-zero emissions within 10 years.", "As we have\u00a0written, Biden has not always been clear when communicating about his climate change policies, but his platform does not include a full ban on either fossil fuels or fracking.", "In her remarks, McDaniel also incorrectly said that 10 million oil and gas jobs would be lost under Democrats. \u201cEliminating 10 million good paying oil and gas jobs is not nice,\u201d she said.", "According to the American Petroleum Institute,\u00a09.8 million Americans\u00a0are supported by the oil and gas industry. But that\u2019s a figure for 2011, and API is including indirect employment, or other positions made possible by the industry. Only\u00a02.6 million\u00a0of those jobs are actually in oil and gas, and the number includes part-time jobs.", "The 2020 U.S. Energy and Employment\u00a0report\u00a0suggests the number is lower, or just 1.5 million jobs. In either case, the number of oil and gas jobs is well below 10 million, and McDaniel also incorrectly assumes that all of the jobs would be lost, even though Democratic policies do not go that far.", "In contrasting Trump\u2019s record on crime legislation with Biden\u2019s, Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones and Scott made misleading claims.", "Jones, a Democrat who has endorsed Trump, said of the president: \u201cHe delivered historic criminal justice reform. He ended \u2014 once and for all \u2014 the policy of incarceration of Black people, which has decimated our communities, caused by no other than Joe Biden. Democrats wouldn\u2019t do it. Obama didn\u2019t want to do it. And Joe Biden and Kamala Harris definitely wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d (Jones\u2019 prepared remarks said \u201cmass incarceration.\u201d)", "Scott also faulted Biden: \u201cIn 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of Black Americans behind bars,\u201d he said.", "But as we\u2019ve written before, the blame for mass incarceration goes well beyond the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which received bipartisan support and was shepherded through the legislative process by then-Sen. Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994 \u2014 in the early 1970s \u2014 though experts say the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.", "\u201cIn the 1970s, the numbers of arrests and court caseloads increased, and prosecutors and judges became harsher in their charging and sentencing,\u201d a two-year study by the National Research Council said. \u201cIn the 1980s, convicted defendants became more likely to serve prison time.\u201d The report cited policies enacted by officials at all levels that expanded the use of incarceration, largely in response to decades of rising crime.", "But the 1994 crime bill included\u00a0a federal\u00a0\u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision\u00a0which required mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for those who commit federal violent felonies if they had two or more previous convictions for violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes. And\u00a0it included $8.7 billion for prison construction to states that passed \u201ctruth-in-sentencing\u201d laws requiring that people convicted of violent crimes serve at least 85% of their sentences.", "\u201cAlthough incarceration was already rising steadily before the crime bill, several of its provisions helped increase incarceration even further,\u201d experts with the Brennan Center for Justice\u00a0said in 2016. \u201cOn their own, states passed three-strikes laws, enacted mandatory minimums, eliminated parole, and removed judicial discretion in sentencing. By dangling bonus dollars, the crime bill encouraged states to remain on their tough-on-crime course.\u201d", "As for Jones\u2019 claim that Trump \u201cended \u2014 once and for all \u2014 the policy of [mass] incarceration of Black people,\u201d the First Step Act, which Trump signed in 2018, doesn\u2019t go that far, either. For one, it, like the 1994 crime law, concerns the federal prison system. Most of the country\u2019s incarcerated population is in state prisons and local jails.", "However, the law did change mandatory minimums for some federal offenses.", "Jones claimed that \u201cObama didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d but part of the 2018 law extended a change enacted under then-President Barack Obama. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced a sentencing gap between crack and powder cocaine. (Biden, in 2008, said the disparity \u2014 which meant a defendant would need to possess 100 times more powder cocaine than crack to be subject to the same sentence \u2014 was \u201carbitrary, unnecessary, and unjust.\u201d)", "The 2010 law applied to cases going forward, while the 2018 law was retroactive, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service explained in a 2019 report. Those affected can \u201csubmit a petition in\nfederal court to have their sentences reduced.\u201d", "A 2020 Brennan Center for Justice post said some provisions in the 2018 law, \u201crepresent an important decrease in incarceration,\u201d but \u201cthere\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d", "\u201cIn some old crack cocaine cases, federal prosecutors are opposing resentencing motions or seeking to reincarcerate people who have just been released,\u201d Ames Grawert, senior counsel with the Brennan Center, wrote in the June 23 post, pointing to a Washington Post investigation.", "Scott\u00a0claimed\u00a0that the Republican-crafted\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\u00a0actually increased federal revenue.", "\u201cI know it is critical for us to have a tax code that encourages growth,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe actually saw revenues to the Treasury increase after we lowered taxes in 2017.

Biden supported the\u00a02013 Senate immigration bill, the so-called Gang of Eight bill, which in addition to providing a path to earned citizenship for those then in the country illegally, would have included significant investments in border security. The bill\u00a0would have roughly doubled the number of border patrol agents along the Mexican border, added 350 miles of new fencing, and added a host of security and technologies to prevent illegal immigration.", "Biden also supports the programs known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, created by Obama. And Biden has vowed that he will halt construction of any more border wall (though he has\u00a0stopped short\u00a0of saying he would dismantle any fencing constructed during the Trump administration).", "But that\u2019s not the same as advocating open borders.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it\u2019s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it.

When I took office, we had almost nothing.\u201d As we\u2019ve explained, that\u2019s false.", "In her remarks, Patty McCloskey, who, along with her husband, is facing\u00a0felony charges\u00a0for pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters who marched by their St. Louis home in June, falsely suggested that Trump eliminated a federal rule that \u201cforced rezoning\u201d in the suburbs.", "\u201cThey\u2019re not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities, they want to abolish the suburbs all-together by ending single-family home zoning,\u201d McCloskey said. \u201cThis forced rezoning would bring crime, lawlessness and low-quality apartments into now thriving suburban neighborhoods. President Trump smartly ended this government overreach, but Joe Biden wants to bring it back.\u201d", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written\u00a0before, what Trump\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development has\u00a0announced\u00a0it will end is a 2015 HUD rule that was\u00a0intended\u00a0to reinforce a clause of the Fair Housing Act that requires HUD and other federal agencies to \u201caffirmatively\u201d further fair housing in \u201ctheir programs and activities relating to housing and urban development.\u201d The 1968 law\u00a0prohibits\u00a0discrimination in housing.", "A\u00a0HUD fact sheet\u00a0at the time defined \u201caffirmatively furthering fair housing\u201d as \u201ctaking meaningful actions, in addition to\u00a0combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from\u00a0barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics.\u201d", "Experts told us the rule didn\u2019t mandate low-income housing or rezoning. In fact, the rule said\u00a0it \u201cdoes not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government.\u201d It established a more\u00a0structured reporting process\u00a0by which all jurisdictions that receive funding from HUD would use HUD-provided data and tools to develop a plan to address fair housing issues in their communities.", "Some \u201cjurisdictions might identify\u201d low-income housing or zoning reform \u201cas remedies\u201d to discriminatory housing practices,\u00a0Robert Silverman, a professor in the University at Buffalo\u2019s urban and regional planning department, told us.
