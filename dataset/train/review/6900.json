["A claim that on January 1, 2021, a new law took effect in Pakistan requiring men to have two marriages has been viewed more than\u00a05 million times on TikTok. The claim is likely satirical; similar claims have circulated in satirical posts in previous years and no such law was enacted in January 2021.", "The video was published here\u00a0on TikTok on November 5, 2020.", "The superimposed Urdu text on the video translates to English as: \u201cLawyers of Pakistan, Marriage Bill passed. Two\u00a0marriages declared mandatory, permission from the first wife is not necessary. Will take effect from 1st January, 2021. Notifications follow.\u201d", "Some TikTok users appeared to believe the claim, posting comments in Urdu-language that translate as \u201cLies, they said this before too and then nothing\u201d and \u201cKeep your laws to yourself, whatever the Shariah says is better for us. Forget 2, do 4 but fulfill their rights if you have the guts.\u201d", "The video was also posted here on Facebook alongside a similar\u00a0claim.", "The video\u2019s claim, however, is likely\u00a0satire.", "Other TikTok users found the news humorous, with one commenter saying in an English\u00a0literation of Urdu: \"shut your face\".", "Moreover, no such law has been enacted in January 2021, as seen on the National Assembly of Pakistan's official website.", "In Pakistan, it is legal for men to marry up to four wives. The Supreme Court, however, ruled in August 2020 that husbands must seek the approval of the first wife before marrying a second time.", "A similar claim was published on Facebook here in 2018. The post shows an image of a newspaper with an Urdu headline that reads: \u201cNikkah Bill every male ordered to have 2 marriages, denial will result in jail.\u201d", "The last line of the news story is not entirely legible, however, it identifies this law coming into effect in the district of Malakand in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province due to \"a shortage of males\".", "The superimposed Urdu text at the top of the image translates as: \u201cHope I don\u2019t cry from happiness\u201d.", "The Urdu caption of the post reiterates the headline of the newspaper with an added line that reads: \"Now that's what I call change.\"", "However, no such law has been enacted anywhere in Pakistan as of January 12, 2021, according to the bills passed by the\u00a0National Assembly of Pakistan.", "Furthermore, according to the website of Punjab\u00a0government in Pakistan, the existing\u00a0Muslim Family Laws Ordinance\u00a01961\u00a0states: \"No man, during the subsistence of an existing marriage, shall, except with the previous permission in writing of the Arbitration Council, contract another marriage, nor shall any such marriage contracted without such permission be registered under this Ordinance.\"", "The UK broadcaster BBC also published a report in 2016 here\u00a0that detailed similar hoax claims about mandatory two marriage laws in Iraq and multiple African countries on account of an alleged shortage in the male populations.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
