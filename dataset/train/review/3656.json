It was earlier claimed that these children were caught in Kolkata while on their way to a madrasa in Pune where they would be getting trained in terrorism.", "The video actually represents an incident which took place at Kolkata\u2019s Sealdah railway station in 2015. The children were apprehended by the police due to the alleged lack of documentation. The Indian Express had reported at the time that these children were intercepted by the Government Railway Police (GRP) based on a tip-off by CINI Asha Child Welfare Society.", "A protest was staged against the apprehension, citing religious discrimination \u2013 \u201cIt is unfair on their part. Only because there are so many Muslims travelling, they think they are going to be trained as terrorists. Do we now need passports to travel within our own country? They were little children who were going to study\u201d.", "In a conversation with Alt News, then chairman of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Asokendu Sengupta categorically denied the allegation raised by the protesters against the detention of the children being an attempt to stop them from taking religious training. He said, \u201cAs far as my knowledge goes, first of all, the incident is old and we took the decision based on a report by the Childline Sealdah. In this particular case, some children accompanied by one or two senior members were going from one place to another without any documents. That\u2019s why I asked the childline to not to allow them to move any further. According to JJ [Juvenile Justice] Act, CWC is the legal custodian of all the children (in need of care & protection, CNCP) of their respective districts. So the boys needed to be sent to their respective [district] CWC authorities for identification. The protestors started a clamour that the children were apprehended only with the intention to stop them from taking religious training. That was not the case at all.\u201d", "BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had retweeted an old video propagated with a false claim.
