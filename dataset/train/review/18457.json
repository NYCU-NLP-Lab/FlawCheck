["About this rating", "A Danish television program has an unusual main character named John Dillermand who possesses an even more unusual physical characteristic.", "Dillermand is a man with a very large penis that can perform rescue operations, steal ice cream from children, create murals, and more. His penis has a life of its own, and he often can barely control it. But with its help, he manages to overcome many challenges.", "This is the premise of a new children's show in Denmark that premiered in January 2021 on DR, a Danish public broadcasting service like the BBC.", "Episodes for the show are available online for free, and they\u2019re only around five minutes long. The introduction can be viewed below:", "The show immediately faced criticism because the subject matter was perceived as celebrating the power of male genitalia and promoting it to children.", "\u201cIt\u2019s perpetuating the standard idea of a patriarchal society and normalising \u2018locker room culture\u2019 [\u2026] that\u2019s been used to excuse a lot of bad behaviour from men. It\u2019s meant to be funny \u2013 so it\u2019s seen as harmless. But it\u2019s not. And we\u2019re teaching this to our kids,\u201d said Christian Groes, an associate professor and gender researcher at Roskilde University.", "But others argued that critics were overthinking things.", "\u201cJohn Dillermand talks to children and shares their way of thinking \u2013 and kids do find genitals funny,\u201d said Erla Heinesen H\u00f8jsted, a clinical psychologist who works with families and children. \u201cThe show depicts a man who is impulsive and not always in control, who makes mistakes \u2013 like kids do, but crucially, Dillermand always makes it right. He takes responsibility for his actions. When a woman in the show tells him that he should keep his penis in his pants, for instance, he listens. Which is nice. He is accountable.\u201d", "Given that the show is available on DR, the Danish public broadcasting network, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
