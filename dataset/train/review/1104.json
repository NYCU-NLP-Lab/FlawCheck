Burger King wrote: \"Women belong in the kitchen.\"", "While this message appeared quite sexist at first glance \u2014 fast food rival KFC even responded via their \"KFC Gaming\" account with a message telling Burger King to delete their tweet.

This sexist message was supposed to bring attention to the fact that the culinary industry is comprised mostly of men.", "Burger King truly did post \"Women belong in the kitchen\" on International Women's Day in 2021.
