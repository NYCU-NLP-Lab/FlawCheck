I connected with some youngsters from trade unions who have been doing this work. So I joined them, we just shifted to old Mustafabad which is right next to Shiv Vihar \u2013 one of the worst affected areas. A lot of victims who lost their homes came here for refuge. We set up a relief base here. Yesterday was the first time I saw the video so I asked locals around here and one of them said they know the person who distributed the money. Since this was in the same locality where we set up our base, it wasn\u2019t difficult for us [to debunk the video].\u201d", "Chandra Mohan also said that Shahzad Malik, the man who was seen handing out money, has original videos of the relief work.

Some ration was arranged from outside to be distributed to these people but there were some 100-150 women who had nothing. Some of them also had children. I could not see their plight.
