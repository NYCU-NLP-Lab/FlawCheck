["In the aftermath of the recently concluded assembly election in which the BJP suffered a setback, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted on December 23 that BJP, despite having a 7 percent vote share in Telangana managed to win just one seat, whereas the Owaisi led AIMIM with a vote share of merely 2.7 percent bagged 7 seats in the election.", "In Telangana, AIMIM with just 2.7% vote share won 7 seats but BJP with 7% got just won. Let that sink in.", "\u2014 Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) December 23, 2018", "While the numbers cited by Malviya are correct, the claim is misleading. This is because while the AIMIM had a vote share of 2.7%, the party had contested on merely 8 seats, of which it won 7. On the other hand, BJP had contested 118 out of 119 seats in the state assembly. AIMIM thus has a far superior strike rate of 87.5 percent (7 out of 8) in comparison to the BJP\u2019s dismal strike rate of 0.85 percent (1 out of 118). The complete details are available on the website of the Election Commission.", "\u201cToday is Sunday.
