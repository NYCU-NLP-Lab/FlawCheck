["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on December 19, 2017 | Updated on December 28, 2017", "Q: Were illegal voters bused in to Alabama to swing the election to Doug Jones? Were thousands of fraudulent votes recorded for him?", "A: Those claims were made by self-described \u201csatirical\u201d websites. The Alabama Secretary of State says there\u2019s no evidence that fraudulent voting affected the outcome.", "Is it true there was voter fraud in the Jones\\Moore campaign? I read that a small town of 1800 people had over 5000 votes for Jones.", "Alabama voters elected Democrat Doug Jones their next U.S. senator on Dec. 12. A week later, his Republican opponent, Roy Moore, still hasn\u2019t conceded the race.", "In that time, a number of websites have posted made-up stories suggesting that rampant voter fraud contributed to Jones winning by an unofficial margin of 20,715 votes.", "But, there is no evidence of wide-spread voter fraud. The Alabama Secretary of State\u2019s Office, which oversees statewide elections, doesn\u2019t usually comment on reports of voter fraud, but it has not received reports in any numbers that would change the outcome of the election, Communications Director John Bennett told us on Dec. 13. That interview was for an article we wrote about a fake story that said 60,000 votes in Birmingham, Alabama, may be invalid.", "Since then, the same network of self-described \u201csatirical\u201d websites that originally published that bogus story has fabricated several more advancing the idea that the outcome of that special election is questionable. A disclaimer on each of the affiliated websites states: \u201cEverything on this site is fiction.\u201d", "Facebook users flagged some of the stories after they were published by other websites without a satire label. Our readers have inquired about them, as well.", "Claim: Black residents from other states were bused in to vote for Jones.", "A story published on the Patriot Post website carried the headline: \u201cBREAKING: Busload Of Blacks From 3 States Drove To Alabama To Vote Illegally.\u201d That didn\u2019t happen. All of the details in the story were fabricated.", "For example, the story quotes a fictional official from the \u201cState Election Integrity Board,\u201d which does not exist. Then it says that 27 black people were arrested at \u201cWarsaw Middle School in Selma,\u201d which is not a real school. It also identifies the Selma police chief as \u201cSantiago Swearinger,\u201d when his name is actually Spencer Collier.", "In addition, the story also featured the photos of eight young African Americans who were not involved in the Alabama special election. The photos were taken in 2014 after those eight teens were arrested for allegedly throwing rocks and food from their school bus at passing vehicles in South Carolina.", "Claim: Thousands of fraudulent votes were recorded in one small Alabama town.", "The headline on another fake story from Ladies of Liberty, a related website, reads: \u201c\u2018Thousands\u2019 Voted For Doug Jones In Alabama Town With Population Of 2,256.\u201d", "According to the story, the town of \u201cBordalama,\u201d which is described as being 20 miles outside of Birmingham, recorded 5,327 votes for Jones, even though it has only 2,256 residents. But there is no such municipality in the state of Alabama, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A link on \u201cBordalama\u201d in the story takes readers to the website for the cartoon band \u201cHampton and the Hampsters.\u201d", "The bogus story suggests that the votes of dead residents were counted for Jones, and the featured photo shows headstones decorated with \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. That picture, though, has been part of a popular internet meme, titled \u201cDemocratic Voter Registration,\u201d that has been in circulation since at least 2012.", "The original photo of headstones \u2014 without the stickers\u2013 appeared online as early as 2007, when it was used to illustrate a Ukrainian website\u2019s story about the psychological effect the fear of death has on people.", "Claim: 13 Hispanic men voted multiple times.", "This fake story, also posted by Ladies of Liberty, falsely claims that the \u201cBirmingham Press\u201d reported that \u201cpolling officials caught what appears to be a \u2018van full of illegals\u2019 who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore\u2019s opponent Doug Jones.\u201d", "That was not reported by the \u201cBirmingham Press,\u201d which is the name of a British website, not an Alabama news publication. A link to the alleged article leads to the same bogus story about unauthorized immigrants voting that was published on fellow \u201csatirical\u201d website, No Fake News Online.", "The story says that the vehicle transporting the men was stopped by law enforcement at \u201cSanta Recto Middle School in Wilmington,\u201d as reported by the \u201cSanta Recto Observer.\u201d But neither the school nor the newspaper exist. And \u201cSan Salmos\u201d and \u201cPuerta Gorda\u201d \u2014 where some of the men were alleged to be from \u2014 are not countries.", "There is only one person named in the story, \u201cMarcos Ramos.\u201d But that is also the name of a made-up character in another bogus\u00a0Patriot Post story\u00a0about illegal voting in Alabama. That story claimed the \u201c32-year-old\u00a0Marcos Ramos\u201d worked at the Democratic National Committee,\u00a0according to a non-existent Alabama publication, the \u201cMobile Press.\u201d", "Furthermore, the Patriot Post\u2019s fake story contains a split-screen image of two men, but neither man is \u201cRamos.\u201d One photo shows a Mexican national who pleaded guilty in 2016 to smuggling methamphetamine into New Mexico. The other photo of an unidentified immigrant being deported to Mexico was used in a 2016 Arizona Republic story about illegal U.S. border crossings.", "Update, Dec. 28:\u00a0Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill reiterated in a Dec. 28 interview that there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the election results. He\u00a0told CNN that his office has received \u201cwell more than 100\u201d reports of voter fraud and has \u201cadjudicated more than 60 of those.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Moore, Roy. \u201cJudge Roy Moore Campaign Statement.\u201d Youtube. 13 Dec 2017.", "Alabama Secretary of State.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
