["The post has been viewed over 1.3 million times on Facebook since it was posted on April 16, 2020. It has\u00a0been shared numerous times in South Africa, India and\u00a0the United States.", "The video features Stig Severinsen from Denmark\u00a0who holds two Guinness World Records for holding his breath while swimming under ice. He also once\u00a0claimed the record for the \u201clongest time breath held voluntarily\u201d by a male underwater at 22 minutes. (His record has since been beaten by Spaniard Aleix Segura Vendrell).", "Known as the \"Human Dolphin\", Severinsen is also a four-time freediving world champion and teaches breathing techniques.", "The video caption\u00a0reads: \u201c3 things about masks from Human Dolphin. Stig is the first man to hold his breath under water for over 20 minutes. He's also a 4x Free diving world champion. He shares his wisdom and is giving his training & book for free to help out (sic)\u201d.", "Articles here and here say Severinsen holds a Masters degree in biology and a PhD in medicine from the University of Aarhus, Denmark.", "\"First of all, it doesn't matter whether you use the P95 medical, if you use the surgical masks, whatever mask -- it's just a physical barrier, so it will not prevent coronavirus. Many people get this wrong,\" Severinsen\u00a0 says in the video.", "But experts say this is misleading.", "Wolfgang Preiser, head of Stellenbosch University's medical virology division in South Africa, told AFP in an email there were three types of masks serving\u00a0different purposes.", "\u201cN95 (FFP2) masks for when exposed to aerosols (very fine particles), e.g., when caring for COVID patients who are intubated (those who wear them need to undergo training and the fit of the mask needs to be tested); surgical masks that mainly protect others and the environment from you; and cloth = non-medical masks that may protect, to some degree, others and the environment from the bearer,\u201d Preiser wrote.", "He said the purpose of non-medical masks was to slow down the spread of the virus in the community.", "Dr.\u00a0Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, said\u00a0Severinsen\u2019s statement \u201cseems to be confused on some points\u201d.", "\u201cAn N95 or P95 mask is a filter that has been certified to catch most particles of a specific size, but only if it is fit-tested to make sure there is a good seal with your face,\u201d Neuman told AFP in an email.", "He said physical barriers were the main idea behind all medical personal protective equipment, and work \u201cfantastically\u201d if used correctly and precaution is taken when taking off potentially contaminated equipment.", "\u201cBut you don't necessarily need an N95 mask outside a lab or hospital,\u201d Neuman added.", "\u201cAny kind of barrier over the mouth and nose including a homemade mask will prevent most of those droplets from coming out\u00a0or in, and that is how ordinary masks can prevent infection.\u201d", "Karine Le Roch, a professor of cell biology at the University of California, echoed Neuman's views.", "\u201cWearing a mask will decrease, significantly, the chance to transmit the virus to others. It is not a perfect protection but it can decrease the amount of large droplets by 80 percent,\u201d Le Roch wrote in an email.", "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing a cloth face mask in public settings \u201cwhere other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain especially in areas of significant community-based transmission\u201d.", "The CDC also advises that the use of cloth face masks slows the spread of COVID-19 and helps people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.", "In his video, Severinsen says: \"Second of all, when you have a mask on, breathe in and out, what do you think is happening? A lot of moisture is sitting around here (gestures around the mouth). Who loves moisture? Viruses, bacteria, fungus, it's all a big party -- I'm not saying avoid the mask, I'm saying follow the guidelines but think for yourself.\"", "But Preiser said Severinsen was sharing a misconception.", "\u201cA virus is not a bacterium or fungus. Moist environments tend to favour bacterial and fungal replication which is why it is recommended to wash and/or iron cloth masks at least once daily,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cViruses need live cells to replicate so whether dry or moist, they cannot become more once outside the body.\u201d", "He said it was\u00a0also worth remembering that these would be the mask wearer\u2019s own viruses -- the ones that they breathe out.", "\u201cSo it would not matter as long as the fine droplets that we produce when talking, coughing, sneezing get caught in the mask and not in someone else\u2019s face, nose or eyes.\u201d", "Neuman also pointed out that viruses weren't capable of appearing out of thin air.", "\u201cThey are small, mobile but otherwise rather ordinary bits of biological machinery. Viruses are also quite specific, and rather needy -- viruses rely on dozens to hundreds of processes in a cell going just right, otherwise the virus will have difficulty growing.\u201d", "While breathing in and out does generate moisture, Le Roch said this did not change the fact that wearing a mask still decreases the amount of droplets or virus you release in the air. A mask\u00a0should be changed regularly.", "\u201cWhen wearing a mask, you are not protecting yourself from your own virus but you are protecting others,\u201d Le Roch said.", "In his third and final claim, Severinsen says: \u201cWhen you breathe with this [mask] on in and out, you get the same stuff in, you can't go out like here and breathe fresh air.\u00a0 When you use your nose, it is cleaning the air, it is taking up nitrogen oxide from the sinuses that is antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal and opens up the alveoli, meaning it opens the blood vessels in your lungs, giving you more oxygen.\u201d", "Neuman said the concept of \u201cfresh\u201d air \u201cbeing healthful is rooted in the psychology of what seems nice, not microbiology\u201d.", "\u201cNoses and mucous membranes in general do provide some protection against microbes, but if they were really effective, COVID-19 would not be the problem that it is,\u201d he said. \u201cMasks are porous to allow gas exchange -- they are filters, not simple air-tight barriers.\u201d", "According to Neuman, Severinsen\u2019s referral to \"nitrogen oxide\" could refer to \u201cnitric oxide, a free radical chemical secreted by the immune system that works by forming a molecular bond with the first molecule it bumps into, or perhaps to the anaesthetic laughing gas.\u00a0 Breathing in either of those outside a controlled medical setting would be very unusual and dangerous.\u201d", "Le Roche said that while it was better to breathe fresh air in a clean open space than breathe through a mask when you're alone, the rest of the claim doesn\u2019t hold up.", "\u201cWhen you breathe, you actually breathe oxygen not nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides are toxic to the upper respiratory tract and lungs even at low concentrations.\u201d", "Le Roch said if breathing naturally was \u201cantiviral, antibacterial and antifungal\u201d like the video claims, \u201cyou would not be able to get infected by any virus and bacteria ever!\u201d", "According to an AFP tally, as of May 20, 2020, at least 4,904,717 people globally have tested positive for COVID-19, with 323,137 deaths, and 1,808,014 people have recovered.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
