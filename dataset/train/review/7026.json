["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on September 16, 2020", "In a series of recent appearances, President Donald Trump continued to wrongly insist that the U.S. compares favorably with Europe on both coronavirus cases and deaths.", "Trump falsely said that Europe\u2019s COVID-19 outbreaks are \u201cmuch worse\u201d than those in America and that the U.S. has also done \u201cmuch, much better\u201d on coronavirus deaths, including by having a significantly lower excess mortality rate. While coronavirus cases are increasing in Europe, the U.S.\u2019s per-capita rate is still higher, as is the best estimate of the excess mortality rate.", "Trump has made inaccurate comparisons with\u00a0Europe before, but in a Sept. 10 press briefing, two weekend campaign rallies in Nevada and a Sept. 15 televised town hall, the president continued to insist that the U.S. compares favorably with Europe on coronavirus cases and deaths.", "\u201cBut if you look at the European Union right now, they\u2019re having breakouts like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said at the briefing. \u201cAnd, frankly, their numbers are at a level that are much worse than the numbers here.\u201d", "Three days later, at a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump focused again on Europe. \u201cOther countries are doing terribly,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you see the statistics of us compared to other countries? Us compared to Europe?\u201d", "It\u2019s true that many countries in Europe are experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases that now rivals or exceeds the number of cases those nations had in the spring. But only a few countries are posting more new cases per capita than the U.S. \u2014 and Europe\u2019s rate is about half of America\u2019s.", "According to Oxford University\u2019s Our World in Data, on Sept. 10, the U.S. reported a seven-day average of 106 new coronavirus cases per day per million people, compared with 59 for the European Union and 50 for Europe.", "Only Montenegro, Spain, Andorra, Moldova and France had higher rates of new cases \u2014 and at 112 cases per million, France\u2019s rate was only slightly higher, not \u201cmuch worse\u201d as Trump claimed. Since Montenegro, Moldova and Andorra are not part of the E.U., that means only two E.U. nations, out of 27, had worse outbreaks than the U.S. when adjusted for population.", "When measured cumulatively, only one European nation \u2014 the microstate of San Marino \u2014 has had more COVID-19 cases per capita than the U.S. As of Sept. 15, America has had 19,803 cases per million people, a rate 3.6 to 3.9 times that of Europe (5,546) and the E.U (5,094).", "Trump also gave inaccurate information about Europe\u2019s COVID-19 mortality. When a reporter noted that many people have died in the U.S., Trump falsely claimed that \u201cwe have done much, much better than the European Union.\u201d", "\u201cYesterday, European nations experienced 50% more deaths than the United States,\u201d Trump incorrectly said earlier in the briefing. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t hear these things. You don\u2019t hear these statistics.\u201d", "In both Nevada rallies, the president also rolled out his previously debunked claim that Europe has a much higher excess mortality rate than the U.S.", "\u201cEurope\u2019s excess mortality rate is 24% higher,\u201d Trump said on Sept. 12 to a crowd in Minden, Nevada. He repeated the same statistic at an indoor rally in Henderson the next day.", "Trump doubled down on the claim in an\u00a0ABC News town hall on Sept. 15. \u201cThe excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI mean, I can show you. There\u2019s a chart that just came out a little while ago, excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it\u2019s about 25% better. In one case, it\u2019s over 60% better.\u201d", "The White House did not explain what figure the president had in mind when he said Europe had \u201c50% more deaths,\u201d but we found that was false by several metrics.", "Our World in Data shows that on Sept. 10, the U.S. had more new coronavirus deaths, whether adjusted for population or not, than both Europe and the E.U. The same was true when using the seven-day average of new deaths.", "Using cumulative numbers on Sept. 10, Europe had more deaths than the U.S. on a raw basis, but only about 11% more \u2014 and when taking Europe\u2019s larger population into account, the roles reverse. Per capita, America had 576 deaths per million people, 80% more than the E.U. (318) and 103% more than Europe (282).", "On excess mortality, Trump previously claimed that Europe\u2019s excess mortality rate was 33% or 40% higher than the U.S. Controversial Trump coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, who is a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, also has used 38% in interviews. This time, Trump used 24% and 25% \u2014 but the statistic is still wrong.", "As we wrote earlier, excess mortality is an alternative way of estimating the impact of the coronavirus that looks at the actual number of deaths, regardless of cause, compared with a \u201cnormal\u201d or expected number of deaths during a given time period.", "Many of the deaths this past spring and summer may be due directly to COVID-19, but some may be due to indirect effects of the pandemic, such as those who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention.", "Using updated sources since our last analysis, we found no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that Europe\u2019s excess mortality rate is 24% or 25% higher than America\u2019s. We performed two calculations, the first comparing estimates of excess deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and EuroMOMO, a group monitoring mortality trends in Europe.", "The CDC estimates that between Feb. 1 and Sept. 5, there have been 201,917 to 262,877 excess deaths in the U.S., for a middle estimate of 232,397 excess deaths. For 24 European countries or parts of countries, EuroMOMO estimates there have been 209,144 excess deaths through week 36, or Sept. 6.", "When adjusted for population, those figures work out to show that the U.S. has had 704 excess deaths per million people, slightly more than the EuroMOMO region of Europe\u2019s 680 excess deaths per million.", "Because the EuroMOMO figures only cover a portion of Europe, for a better comparison, we also repeated our analysis using updated figures from the Human Mortality Database. We used data covering 2020 up until June 28 (week 26) because several countries had data only up until that point (Slovenia was once again excluded because it lacked data past week 13).", "For that time period, Europe had 246,620 excess deaths, a 9.9% increase over the number of deaths the continent usually has. The U.S., meanwhile, had 194,936 excess deaths, which is 13.7% more than normal \u2014 meaning the American excess death rate is worse, not better, than Europe\u2019s.", "It\u2019s possible Trump\u2019s 24% and 25% figures come from a calculation based on the raw number of excess deaths for both places \u2014 using the numbers here, the sheer total for Europe is 26.5% higher than the U.S. The campaign did not respond to our query about where the statistic originated or how it was calculated, and the White House has also never provided additional information, despite repeated inquiries about the figure.", "But if that\u2019s the source of the statistic, it\u2019s nevertheless a skewed and misleading portrait of excess mortality because Europe has a significantly larger population than the U.S. The\u00a0best indicator to use is the P-score, or the percentage of excess deaths to \u201cnormal\u201d deaths, and by that measure America\u2019s 13.7% excess mortality rate is 38% higher than Europe\u2019s 9.9% rate.", "On a per-capita basis, Europe has had 509 excess deaths per million, compared with 590 in the U.S.", "A few European countries do have worse excess mortality rates than the U.S., including Spain, which has the worst rate in the region. By the end of June, Spain\u2019s mortality was 22.1% higher than normal, or 62% higher than America\u2019s rate. But looking further out, through Aug. 23, Spain\u2019s rate fell to 19.3%, or 42% higher than the U.S. As Spain is the most extreme example, Trump is cherry-picking this number \u2014 if that\u2019s what he meant when he said in one case the U.S. is \u201cover 60% better.\u201d", "These data once again do not support Trump\u2019s claim that Europe as a whole has significantly more excess death in 2020 than America, and begin to bear out the predictions University of Oxford economists Janine Aron and John Muellbauer made in August, when they said they expected the numbers to worsen for the U.S. as time went on.", "As they noted then, it\u2019s premature to compare excess mortality given the ongoing pandemic, and it\u2019s not entirely fair to relate the U.S. to Europe given America\u2019s younger, less dense population.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
