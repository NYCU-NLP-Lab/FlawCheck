["A timeline of Trump statements about the Iraq war, before and after it started, from September 2002 to December 2003.", "By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 19, 2016", "Donald Trump has repeated throughout his presidential campaign that he opposed the Iraq war before the March 19, 2003 invasion, often taking credit for his judgement and vision \u2014 claiming he knew it would destabilize the Middle East.", "On Feb. 13, in the most recent debate, Trump said: \u201cI said it loud and clear, \u2018You\u2019ll destabilize the Middle East.'\u201d\u00a0In the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, Trump claimed\u00a0that he \u201cfought very, very hard against us \u2026 going into Iraq,\u201d saying he could provide \u201c25 different stories\u201d to prove his opposition.", "Trump has even said that he was \u201cvisited by people from the White House\u201d in attempt to silence him, because, he said, he was getting \u201ca disproportionate amount of publicity\u201d for his opposition to the war.", "There is no evidence that we could find, however, that he spoke against the war before it started, although we did find he expressed early concerns about the cost and direction of the war a few months after it started.", "Others have looked, but no one else \u2014 including PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker \u2014 has been able to find any evidence to support his claims, either. Now, BuzzFeed reports that Trump indicated his support for war in a radio interview with shock jock Howard Stern on\u00a0Sept. 11, 2002 \u2014 a little more than six months before the war started.", "Stern asked Trump directly if he supported going to war with Iraq, and Trump hesitantly responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know if Trump still felt the same way in March of 2003. We do, however, know two things\u00a0after having reviewed\u00a0multiple news archival services in search of Trump\u2019s position on the war:", "Trump had a financial interest in opposing the war in the weeks leading up to the war. The Newark Star-Ledger, New Jersey\u2019s largest newspaper, reported on March 12, 2003 that\u00a0Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts planned \u201cto sell $485 million in junk-grade bonds this week in an effort to avoid a cash crunch later this year.\u201d The uncertainty of war complicated Trump\u2019s bond sale.", "The company began planning for the sale of the bonds in December, and it was completed March 13,2003 \u2014 six days before the war started.\u00a0The Star-Ledger reported that \u201cthe growing threat of war with Iraq\u201dand a proposal to \u201craise casino taxes and install video slot machines at New Jersey\u2019s racetracks \u2026 made it more difficult for the company to find willing investors.\u201d", "After the sale of the bonds was completed, Trump issued a statement\u00a0on March 13 saying he was pleased with the results \u201cdespite difficult capital market conditions and the looming threat of war.\u201d", "Trump expressed concerns about the cost of the war soon after it started. If Trump did support the war, he turned on it quickly. As the timeline below shows, Trump in July said that he wished the money being spent in Iraq could be spent in New York City. By November, he talked about the \u201ctremendous cost\u201d of the war and the \u201cvery, very unpleasant surprises in Iraq.\u201d", "By 2004, Trump\u2019s opposition\u00a0to the war\u00a0was well documented.", "Below is a timeline of all the Trump statements about the Iraq war that we could find in 2002 and 2003. Except for the Howard Stern interview in 2002, which was reported by BuzzFeed, the statements below were culled from numerous archival services available to us at FactCheck.org through the University of Pennsylvania: Access World News, ProQuest, Vanderbilt Television News Archives and LexisNexis.", "We invite anyone \u2014 including the Trump campaign \u2014 to send us additional Trump statements about Iraq from either 2002 or 2003. We will add them to this timeline.", "Sept. 11, 2002: Howard Stern asks Trump if he supports invading Iraq. Trump answers hesitantly. \u201cYeah, I guess so. You know, I wish it was, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d", "Jan. 28, 2003: Trump appears on Fox Business\u2019 \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto,\u201d on the night of President Bush\u2019s State of the Union address. Trump says he expects to hear \u201ca lot of talk about Iraq and the problems,\u201d and the economy. He urges Bush to make a decision on Iraq. \u201cEither\u00a0you attack or you don\u2019t attack,\u201d he says. But he offers no opinion on what Bush should do.", "Cavuto: If you had to sort of breakdown for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?", "Trump: Well, I\u2019m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we\u2019re going in, we\u2019re not going in, the \u2014 you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. We have to \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort like either do it or don\u2019t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we\u2019re going to attack, what routes we\u2019re taking, what kind of planes we\u2019re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I\u2019ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how \u2014 telling the enemy how we\u2019re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.", "Cavuto: Well, the problem right there.", "Trump: Either you attack or you don\u2019t attack.", "Cavuto: The problem there, Donald, is you\u2019re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.", "Trump: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is \u2014 just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don\u2019t do it, or you \u2014 but I just \u2014 or if you don\u2019t do it, just don\u2019t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.", "Cavuto: So you\u2019re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.", "Trump: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.", "March 19, 2003: President George W. Bush announces in a televised address to the nation that the war with Iraq has started.", "March 21, 2003:\u00a0Neil Cavuto of Fox Business interviews Trump about the impact of the Iraq war on the stock market. Trump says the war \u201clooks like a\u00a0tremendous success from a military standpoint,\u201d and he predicts the market will \u201cgo up like a rocket\u201d after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq and Trump doesn\u2019t offer an opinion.", "Trump, March 21, 2003: Well, I think Wall Street\u2019s waiting to see what happens but even before the fact they\u2019re obviously taking it a little bit for granted that it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and I think this is really nothing compared to what you\u2019re going to see after the war is over.", "Cavuto: What do you mean?", "Trump: Well, I think Wall Street\u2019s just going to go up like a rocket even beyond and it\u2019s going to continue and \u2013 you know we have a strong and powerful country and let\u2019s hope it all works out.", "Cavuto: \u2026 Why are you so optimistic?", "Trump: Well, I think a couple of things. I really feel that the key is that interest rates \u2014 beyond the war interest rates are going to have to stay stable and low. That\u2019s going to be very important. And if you really look at Wall Street, Wall Street\u2019s come down thousands and thousands of points over the last number of years. So really, I remember when we were sitting here saying two years ago that Wall Street is going to be double what it was two years ago and a lot of people didn\u2019t believe that and I didn\u2019t believe that, but there were plenty of very intelligent people who said yes. I think that Wall Street will be going up and the market will be going up and there\u2019s great confidence in this great country.", "Cavuto: You know there is a feeling abroad, Donald, that the French don\u2019t like us, the Germans don\u2019t like us. There were protests abroad still continuing around the globe today from Asia to Africa and that there\u2019s going to be hell to pay that maybe some of these same people will prove their wrath by not investing in this country, by doing all sorts of nasty things, do you buy that?", "Trump: Well, the I guess the French never liked us much except when we were bailing them out, to be totally honest with you. But certainly were going to have to work on our public relations because there\u2019s no question there are a lot of countries right now that aren\u2019t too fond of us. I think that can be solved and probably pretty quickly. The main thing is to get the war over with and just make it a tremendously successful campaign and it will be very interesting to see what kind of weapons they find.", "Cavuto: \u2026 Does this put a chill on things economically? Does it scare people into buying [real estate] or not buying, renting and not renting?", "Trump: In a nutshell Neil, the office market is just okay at best. The hotel market is nonexistent. But the residential market for buying, for condos, has been the strongest I\u2019ve ever seen it. It\u2019s amazing. Now, a lot of that has to do I believe with interest rates. You know money is so cheap and people are buying and they are paying the lowest interest rates in 40 years. But the market has been very strong in that sense. There\u2019s been a lot of optimism in New York.", "March 22, 2003: The\u00a0San Antonio Express-News quotes Trump as saying the \u201cwar is depressing.\u201d The article was about the Miss USA pageant, which Trump owned at the time.

We also know that\u00a0Trump\u2019s remarks were in the context of the war\u2019s impact on the stock market. \u00a0The Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0increased 235 points the day after the war, but it dropped 307 points a day after the friendly fire incident.", "July 1, 2003:\u00a0Trump appears on \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews\u201d and expresses concern about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. He made his comment when he was asked about a quote Trump gave in February 2000 about the possibility of running for president.", "Trump, July 1, 2003:\u00a0I never did run [in 2000] and I probably never will run. But we\u2019re having a lot of fun. I think the president is doing a very good job. I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly.", "As an aside, Trump, who lives in New York, was asked by Matthews who he would vote for in a hypothetical 2008 race between two New Yorkers: then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, or former New York City Mayor Rudy\u00a0Giuliani, a Republican. Trump refused to answer.

He asks about terrorism, the Iraq war and New York.", "Trump, Sept. 11, 2003:\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard, and I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.", "Nov. 4, 2003: Trump appears on \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews,\u201d where he is asked about the impact of the economy on President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection bid. Trump says \u201cthe economy is doing well,\u201d but predicts \u201chis bigger problem is going to be what\u2019s happening in Iraq.\u201d Trump talks about the \u201ctremendous cost\u201d of the war and the \u201cvery, very unpleasant surprises in Iraq.\u201d He says, \u201cThe question is whether or not we should have been in Iraq in the first place.\u201d", "Matthews, Nov. 4, 2003:\u00a0Let me ask you about the president\u2019s course from now until next election, until next November. How does it look over the next year? Is it going to stay up? I thought it was interesting that he low-balled this number. He said 7 percent, 7.2 percent, but don\u2019t count on it continuing. Is that smart politics?", "Trump: Well, I think it is smart politics. I think his bigger problem is going to be what\u2019s happening in Iraq. I believe the economy is doing well. I think it could get better, but lots of surprises out on the horizon, and what is going to happen with Iraq, what is going to happen with the world situation, that could be the bigger problem that President Bush has.", "Matthews: What is the economic impact? Is it the cost factor of about $100 billion a year for the military and the rebuilding, is that the cost, or is it psychological?", "Trump: Well, I think it\u2019s psychological. It is also tremendous amounts of money being pumped into Iraq. I mean, you look at states like New York and California, where they can`t afford school systems, and we are giving $87 billion to Iraq and that is just the beginning. So, you know, it is a tremendous cost to this country, what\u2019s gone on there, and again, we are getting some very, very unpleasant surprises in Iraq, and hopefully something is going to be done about it quickly.", "Matthews: This was an elective war. The president thought we had to do it. He made a judgment call. He took us into Iraq. Do you think he will reconsider that judgment as the costs rise?", "Trump: I don\u2019t think he is going to. He is a very committed guy, he\u2019s committed to that whole situation and I don\u2019t think he will really reconsider. I don\u2019t think he probably can at this point. Other people will, and you are going to find out at the polls whether or not those other people are right. I mean, you see more and more doves, if you call them doves. The question is whether or not we should have been in Iraq in the first place. I don\u2019t think that this president can do anything about that. He is really \u2014 he is on a course that has to stay.", "Matthews: Let me ask you about the Democrats. I have noticed a slight \u2014 or other people have noticed a slight shift in direction. Instead of whacking him on the economy, which is starting to look like his strong suit, they are shifting to the war. Is that smart?", "Trump:\u00a0Well, I think that\u2019s the only thing they can do. I mean, the economy is good. New York City is having its best year ever perhaps in real estate. That is a very big indication. In California real estate, where I have a lot, same thing. I mean, the country is starting to do well, so I think the whole shift is going to be very much toward the war.", "Dec. 15, 2003:\u00a0Neil Cavuto of Fox Business\u00a0interviews Trump\u00a0two days after the capture of Iraq President Saddam Hussein.\u00a0Hussein was captured on Dec. 13, 2003, a Saturday when the markets were closed. Trump says Hussein\u2019s capture was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d for the country, but he mentions that \u201ca lot of people [are] questioning\u201d the wisdom of going to war with Iraq in the first place.", "Cavuto: What if this had happened today, Donald, in the middle of the trading day? What would the reaction have been then?", "Trump: Oh, I think it probably would have been even more positive. But ultimately, over the next year, two years, 10 years and 20 years, this is just a great thing for the free world.", "Cavuto: What if we got ahead of ourselves, though? What if, for example, the concerns of continued attacks in Iraq do not abate, that that\u2019s still a factor with us and maybe drags on for some time?", "Trump: Well, look, you have a lot of questions and a lot of people questioning the whole concept of going in, in the first place, Neil. But we are in, we went in, you had to find him. If he was alive, you had to find him. And you know, they fulfilled the pledge of finding Saddam Hussein.", "Cavuto: If you are the president\u2019s opponents, what do you do?", "Trump: Well, you have two mixed bags. I mean, you have Mr. [Howard] Dean, that\u2019s going to say we shouldn\u2019t have been there regardless. And you have others that are saying, well, we are there and we have to do the best.\u00a0I mean, we are there, regardless of what should have been done. Some people agree and some people don\u2019t agree, but we are there. And if we are there, you have to take down Saddam Hussein. And they have done that, and they did it maybe not as quickly as they thought in terms of finding him, but they found him.
