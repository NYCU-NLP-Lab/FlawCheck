A number of creative defenses were proffered for the similarities, including one from Gov.

Alinsky wrote, in Rules for Radicals (emphasis added): \u201cThe standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as it is, not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be.\u201d Michelle Obama said: \u201cAnd Barack stood up that day, and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since.

You see, instead of heading to Wall Street, Barack went to work in neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of steel plants. Jobs dried up. And Barack was invited back to speak to people from those neighborhoods about how to rebuild their community.", "And the people gathered there together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life. See, they were parents trying to get by from paycheck to paycheck; grandparents trying to get it together on a fixed income; men frustrated that they couldn't support their families after jobs had disappeared. You see, those folks weren't asking for a handout or a shortcut. See, they were ready to work. They wanted to contribute. They believed, like you and I believe, that America should be a place where you can make it if you try.", "And Barack stood up that day, and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since.
