["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on April 29, 2020", "The United States has not done more COVID-19 testing than \u201cevery country combined,\u201d as President Donald Trump claimed in remarks during a recent press briefing.", "In fact, three countries alone \u2014 Russia, Germany and Italy \u2014 have done more combined testing than the U.S., according to a reference website tracking global testing for the disease.", "The president most recently made the false statement at an April 28 White House event highlighting the federal Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But he has been making a version of the claim for more than a week. (We\u2019re not the first to point out he\u2019s wrong.)", "Trump, April 28: We are way ahead on testing. We are the best in the world on testing. We\u2019ve tested much more than anybody else, times two \u2014 or every country combined. We\u2019ve tested more than every country combined.", "As of the afternoon of April 29, the U.S had done almost 6.03 million tests for the disease, according to data collected by Worldometer, a widely cited data aggregation website. (The website\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page says it is run by an \u201cinternational team of developers, researchers, and volunteers\u201d and \u201cpublished by a small and independent digital media company based in the United States.\u201d)", "The U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done \u2014 but not more than all other countries combined.", "Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy \u2014 the next three countries that have done the most testing \u2014 would produce a higher figure (about 7.29 million) than the U.S. total. And, overall, there have been nearly 25 million tests performed by the 172 non-U.S. countries for which Worldometer has data.", "So, Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to being accurate.", "We would also note \u2014 as we have before \u2014 that the U.S. trails many countries in terms of testing on a per-capita basis, according to multiple sources.", "Worldometer, for example, shows the U.S. doing 18,216 tests per 1 million people, as of April 29. But that was a lower figure than those of 41 other countries.", "That is something else to consider when the president boasts that the U.S. \u2014 which is the third most populous country \u2014 has done a lot more testing than any other nation.", "FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
