Similarly, Biden told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace in an interview March 1:\u00a0\u201cI guess I should have said, I was detained.\u201d", "As the New York Times first reported on Feb. 21, Biden said on at least three occasions that he had been \u201carrested\u201d in Soweto while trying to see Mandela on Robben Island, where the future leader of South Africa had been imprisoned from 1964 to 1982.

She was teaching.", "Biden proposed to his wife in 1977, the Times story said. Andrew Young, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1977 to 1979, told the Times that he had traveled with Biden to South Africa but \u201cI was never arrested and I don\u2019t think he was, either.\u201d", "We asked the Biden campaign to clarify Biden\u2019s remarks, but it did not respond to our request. It also did not respond to the New York Times. \u201cMr. Biden\u2019s campaign did not respond to five efforts to seek comment and clarification,\u201d the Times wrote.", "However, Biden did address it on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Feb. 28 \u2014 one day before his big victory in South Carolina\u2019s Democratic presidential primary \u2014 and then again on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on March 1.", "On CNN, Biden said upon landing in South Africa he refused to take the whites-only entrance, because he would have been separated from African American members of the congressional delegation.

They had me get off a plane. The Afrikaners got on in their short pants and their guns, let me off for \u2014 led me off first and moved me in a direction totally different. I turned around and everybody \u2014 the entire black delegation was going another way. I said, I\u2019m not going to go in that door that says white only. I\u2019m going with them. They said, you\u2019re not. You can\u2019t move.", "You can\u2019t go with them. And they \u2014 and they kept me there until finally I decided they were clear I wasn\u2019t going to move. And so what they finally did, they said, OK, they\u2019ll not going to make the congressional delegation go through the black door. They\u2019re not going to make me go through the white door. They went \u2014 took us out \u2014 if my memory serves me, through a baggage claim area up to a restaurant and they cleared out a restaurant.", "I felt strongly about apartheid. One of the reasons we were there. And after \u2014 long after this, when Nelson Mandela was freed and came to the United States, he came in my office. He was one of the most incredible men I ever met. He sat down in my office and thanked me \u2014 thanked me for trying to \u2014 all the work I did on apartheid.", "And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the context of it. When I said arrested, I meant I was not able to \u2014 I was not able to move. Cops, Afrikaners, would not let me go with them. Made me stay where I was. I guess I wasn\u2019t arrested, I was stopped.

You were at the airport in Johannesburg and you were stopped from going through the door for blacks. I guess the question is, were you confused or were you just trying to embellish a story?", "Biden: No. No, what I was trying to \u2014 what I was doing was talking about the fact that I was strongly opposed to apartheid. When we landed and \u2014 we were going to Soweto actually. We landed in Johannesburg and the Afrikaners took me off the plane and took me into one direction, wanted me to go through a white-only door, and in fact, I wouldn\u2019t move. I said everybody else is going through to another door, I\u2019m going with the \u2014 with the black delegation that I came with.", "They said, no, you can\u2019t. And I said, I\u2019m staying here, I\u2019m not going to move. And they would not let me move anywhere so I guess I should have said, I was \u2014 I was detained, I was not able to move forward.
