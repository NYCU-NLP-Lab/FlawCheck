Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced virtually all aspects of the program.

In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.\"", "The Senate report did not name the two psychologists, but many news reports did.
