So your PolitiFact Georgia scribe ordered a pint \u2013 even Beerack, er, Barack Obama knows the value of a good beer summit \u2013 and settled in to research whether the state\u2019s brewpubs can\u2019t sell their products to go.", "Bitter brew", "Georgia\u2019s history of direct beer sales to consumers is a bitter one. Craft brewers have sought for at least a decade to change the state law that keeps them from making money from those who want to quaff their wares.", "In this year\u2019s legislative session, Senate Bill 63 originally would have given breweries and brewpubs their wish.", "But the final version instead gave craft brewers the ability only to sell tours and give away their product \u2013 a backdoor way to sell limited amounts of beer to go - and stripped out brewpubs\u2019 ability to do the same.", "Controversy is brewing over that change, now that the state Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin forbidding brewers from charging different prices for the tours based on the value of the beers offered.", "And brewpubs? The law makes it clear they must sell only on site or to wholesale dealers \u2013 the middleman that direct sales would avoid.", "\"We have had so many people come in, locals, students, parents and they love our beer and want to take some home with them,\" said Moran, who co-owns the Slice and Pint and two locations of the 5 Seasons brewpub. \"But the state legislature said those people can\u2019t buy beer where they want to.

The state has just 12 other brewpubs, Palmer said, and all sell to that middleman, who can then make it available to go at package stores and the like.", "Rules on the Department of Revenue website confirm use of wholesalers, as does the new legislation.
