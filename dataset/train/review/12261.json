The links take you to virtually endless slideshows (which increase ad revenue by providing more room for advertisements) that never identifies what the \"most loved line\" in the film actually is. At no point in this slide show, furthermore, is there a discussion of how a mistake led to a line not originally intended for the film.", "Because this ad makes an assertion in its headline text that is unsupported and unaddressed by the content within, we rate the claim as \"False.\"", "Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages. It's called advertising \"arbitrage.\" The advertiser's goal is to make more money on ads displayed on the slideshow's pages than it cost to show the initial ad that lured them to it.
