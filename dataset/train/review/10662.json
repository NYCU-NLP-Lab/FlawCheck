And they\u2019ve done it through monetary manipulation, by devaluations. And very sophisticated. I mean, they\u2019re grand chess players at devaluation.\"", "We were curious about Trump\u2019s claim that the United States is responsible for China\u2019s rapid economic growth.

Reforms to property and taxation have been much more fundamental.\"", "Economists point to the opening up of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the beginning of its meteoric growth. Following the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping introduced economic reforms and open trade with the West in 1979. From then to 2014, China saw double-digit growth in GDP every year, effectively doubling its economy every eight years, according to the Congressional Research Service.", "Arguably, China\u2019s economic liberalization, and subsequent prosperity, was prompted by years of U.S. efforts at rapprochement through Henry Kissinger\u2019s secret visits, Richard Nixon\u2019s historic trip and, of course, ping pong. In 2000, the United States also lobbied for China\u2019s inclusion in the World Trade Organization (as Trump mentions on his website), further embedding Beijing in the world economy.", "Today, the United States and China are each other\u2019s largest trading partners.
