["About this rating", "On 2 April 2017, the YouTube Channel \"UFOmania - The truth is out there\" published a video about an ancient city that was allegedly discovered beneath Cades Cove, a valley in the Great Smoky Mountains:", "This is not an original report from UFOmania. The narrator's script, as well as the photographs, originally appeared in an article published on experiencecadescove.com on 1 April 2017, which was, of course, April Fool's Day. In addition to the highly suspicious publication date, the article ended with the following paragraph (emphasis ours):", "For information about seeing the underground city in Cades Cove, don\u2019t check back here. This entire story has been an April Fools\u2019 Day joke! To the best of our knowledge, there aren\u2019t any subterranean cities located beneath the Smoky Mountains. However, there are plenty of wonderful things to see and do above ground in Cades Cove.

For one, the article included an image purportedly showing a tweet from the account @GSMNPNews:", "However, the account @GSMNPNews doesn't exist. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park uses the Twitter handle @GreatSmokyNPS. The underground system of caves does exist, though \u2014 it is a Byzantine-era network of tunnels and living areas thought to be used as ancient hiding places that was unearthed in Cappadocia, Turkey, in 2015.", "Fishman, Jason. \u00a0 \"Centuries-Old Underground City Discovered Beneath Cades Cove.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Experience Cades Cove. \u00a0 1 April 2017.", "Pinkowski, Jennifer. \u00a0 \"Massive Underground City Found in Cappadocia Region of Turkey.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Geographic. \u00a0 26 March 2015.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
