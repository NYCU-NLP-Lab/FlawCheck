["About this rating", "In early December 2020, news stories echoed rumors that U.S. President Donald Trump had discussed with aides the possibility of granting preemptive pardons for unspecified crimes to his three eldest children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka Trump, as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.", "Trump hasn't commented publicly on these stories, but the idea was supported by Fox News personality Sean Hannity, of whom Trump is a known fan.
