We found several articles written on the phenomenon which is not uncommon and has been seen at various places around the world. A sun halo or 22 degree Halo is a ring caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds within the earth\u2019s atmosphere, according to University of Illinois\u2019 Weather World Project 2010 explainer on the topic. The ring is formed around the sun or moon.", "While primary rainbows are red on the outside and violet on the inside, sun halos are red inside and violet outside.

The halo is created when the Sun is aligned with these crystals at a particular angle\u201d, stated the report.", "While the video posted by Anand Mahindra depicts a sun halo, a full circle rainbow has also been spotted several times around the world. An explanation given in a Slate Magazine article reads, \u201cWe see rainbows in the sky because in general, the ground is close to you. When we look up toward the sky we see for a long way, and there are lots of raindrops along your eyeline that can add their light together to make the rainbow. When you look down, the ground gets in the way, there aren\u2019t as many drops, and you don\u2019t see a rainbow.\u201d", "The official website of the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office also reiterated, \u201cThe key factor that determines how much of a rainbow we see is our visual reference point. In most cases we only see less than half of a circle \u2013 the characteristic rainbow arc we are all familiar with. However, if you are lucky enough to be in the right position at the right time, you can see a full circle rainbow in all its splendour.\u201d The article", "In cases of a rainbow, sunlight that enters individual droplets of liquid water bends or refract multiple times.
