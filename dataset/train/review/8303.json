Let me be clear: My family & I will not be intimidated by leftwing violence.\"", "He was referring to a demonstration held by activist group ShutDownDC. The group was protesting Hawley\u2019s announcement that he would object to electoral votes from some states when the Senate convened Wednesday to certify the results of November\u2019s election.

The video shows a protest that, while disruptive, included no threats and no attempts to break inside. There was also no violence. However, protesters wrote messages on the sidewalk with chalk and were warned by police for that.", "There were about 15 people there, according to the Washington Post.", "Protesters shouted chants such as \"shame on Hawley\" and \"protect democracy from the GOP.\" Protesters also lit candles, held signs, gave speeches and walked up to his door to deliver a copy of the U.S. Constitution.", "Phil Letsou, Hawley\u2019s deputy communications director, pointed to a moment in the video where protesters exchange words with Hawley\u2019s wife and neighbors who came outside. The wife and the neighbors asked the protesters to leave, which they refused, but the protesters did not threaten, commit violence, vandalize or attempt to break in.", "The demonstration lasted for about a half hour.", "Hawley said protesters at his Virginia home \"screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open (his) door.\"", "This conflicts with police accounts of the event and a video showing the full demonstration.
