["About this rating", "On 23 December 2016, President Obama signed a Defense Department appropriations bill with a provision establishing an interagency office to identify and combat foreign propaganda.", "The provision is aimed at countering foreign sources of disinformation and does not apply to American independent or alternative media.", "On 25 December 2016, the unreliable political site YourNewsWire.com published an article asserting that President Obama had signed a \"Christmas bill ... quietly\" that effectively labeled alternative media as \"propaganda\" and criminalized it:", "President Obama has just quietly signed into law a bill that makes it illegal to run an alternative media website in the U.S ... two days before Christmas [2016], Obama signed the \u201cIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017\u201d bill into law.", "Wearechange.org reports:", "This bill will \u201cCriminalize \u2018Fake News, Propaganda\u2019 on the Web,\u201d a key piece of legislation meant to crack down on free speech and independent media.

One, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (H.R. 6393, reintroduced as H.R. 6480), authorized funding for the federal intelligence services. The other, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017, authorized funding for the Department of Defense. While both contained provisions related to foreign propaganda, only one, the NDAA, was signed into law before Christmas 2016. It contained a section (originally introduced as separate legislation called the Counter Disinformation and Anti-Propaganda Act) described by its bipartisan co-sponsors as follows:", "[On 16 March 2016], U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) introduced legislation to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations. Specifically, the bill will improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation by leveraging existing expertise and empowering local communities to defend themselves from foreign manipulation.", "\u201cIn order to improve our response to foreign propaganda and disinformation, we need a comprehensive strategy. We have to delegitimize false narratives coming out of Russia, China and other nations and increase access to factual information,\u201d said Portman. \u201cBy directly countering false narratives and empowering local media and civil societies to defend themselves from foreign manipulation, this legislation will help support our allies and interests in this increasingly unstable world. This bill underscores the United States\u2019 commitment to protecting the freedom of the marketplace of ideas on the international stage. I\u2019m proud to join my colleague, Senator Murphy, on this bipartisan effort.\u201d", "\u201cA hallmark of democracy is the free flow of accurate, uncensored information, but many nations today are bombarded by foreign propaganda and manipulated information. This disinformation is often intended specifically to undermine the United States, our allies, and interests,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cKeeping America safe requires us to adapt alongside the threats we face, and right now, we\u2019re too slow to adapt to the disinformation campaigns of our adversaries and competitors. The Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act would ensure America\u2019s national security infrastructure helps counter the false narratives that harm our security \u2014 delivering truthful information and making the world a safer place for the United States and our allies.\u201d", "Note that according to its authors, the legislation was conceived not to clamp down on alternative news sources within the U.S., but rather to protect the \"freedom of the marketplace of ideas on the international stage.\" Note also that as written into the NDAA, the legislation's provisions establish an inter-agency body \"to track and evaluate  counterfactual narratives abroad that threaten the national security interests of the United States and United States allies,\" and to develop \"procedures to expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation and proactively promote fact-based narratives and policies to audiences outside the United States.\"", "Similarly, language in the Intelligence Authorization Act (passed by the House but not yet, as of this writing, passed by the Senate or signed into law) would establish an executive branch committee \"to counter active measures by the Russian Federation to exert covert influence over peoples and governments.\"", "So, while neither bill explicitly rules out targeting the spread of disinformation on the home front, the stated focus in both cases is on stemming its flow abroad. More to the point, the focus is on disinformation originating from foreign sources (e.g., Russia and China), not domestic ones. Contrary to rumor, therefore, there is nothing in either bill, targeting or \"criminalizing\" practitioners of so-called \"alternative media\" or \"independent journalism\" within the United States.", "As with any legislation, there is always the possibility that in practice its scope will extend, for good or ill, beyond the authors' original intentions (and that circumstance can be cause for concern), but there is nothing in the language itself that directly threatens the freedom of American journalists.", "Chesney, Robert. \u00a0 \"Key Provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Act (FY'17).\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Lawfare. \u00a0 2 December 2016.", "Johnson, Justin T. \u00a0 \"An NDAA Veto Unlike Any Other.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Real Clear Defense. \u00a0 15 October 2015.", "Congress.gov. \u00a0 \"H.R.6393 - Intelligence Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2017, 114th Congress.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 22 November 2016.", "Winston-Salem Journal. \u00a0 \"The Roll Call: Sunday, Dec. 4.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 December 2016.", "Federation of American Scientists. \u00a0 \"Presidential Vetoes of Annual Defense Authorization Bills.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1 October 2015.", "Rob Portman. \u00a0 \"Portman, Murphy Introduce Bill to Counter Foreign Government Propaganda.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 March 2016.", "Rob Portman. \u00a0 \"Senate Passes Major Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill As Part of NDAA.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 8 December 2016.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
