Simultaneously, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, similarly reorganized the police of the remaining German states. In April 1933, the Nazis passed a law that allowed state interior ministries to purge police personnel, which led to the firing of \"non-Aryan\" officers and those who had opposed the Nazis.", "That strategy \u2014\u00a0while it did fundamentally change the nature of policing in Germany in the lead-up to World War II \u2014 was not akin to defunding and eliminating police departments.", "\"The very moment the Nazis were in power in each of the German states, they could simply change personnel as well as policies in local police departments,\" said Thomas Weber, a history and international affairs professor at the University of Aberdeen who has authored several books about Hitler. \"This meant that the Nazis had full control over police departments the moment they took over the state government in which that particular police department lay.\"", "\"It would thus simply have made no sense for the Nazis to defund or eliminate police departments, as they already had full control over them.\"", "\"Defund the police\" has become a rallying cry for some activists protesting police brutality against black Americans.
