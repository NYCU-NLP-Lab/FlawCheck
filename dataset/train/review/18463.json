["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 24, 2016", "Donald Trump distorted the facts about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails when he said in Texas that\u00a0\u201cthe FBI found thousands [of emails] she never turned over, and now just recently found another 15,000 more.\u201d", "Trump is right that the FBI recovered \u201cseveral thousand work-related emails\u201d that Clinton did not turn over to the State Department, as FBI Director James Comey disclosed in July. But the FBI did not \u201cjust recently\u201d find \u201canother 15,000 more.\u201d", "Instead, it was recently announced that the FBI recovered a total of about 14,900 emails during its year-long investigation of Clinton, including the \u201cseveral thousand work-related emails\u201d that Comey cited in July.", "Also, Trump claimed that Clinton deleted her emails to \u201ccover up her crimes,\u201d but Comey said the FBI found \u201cno evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails [that the FBI found] were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d", "Trump made his remarks (at the 45:34 mark) during a rally in Austin, Texas, where he talked about the \u201cnew revelations about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 23:\u00a0She said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just recently found another 15,000 more. That was another lie.", "The 15,000 emails weren\u2019t \u201cjust recently found,\u201d and they are not all work-related.", "Let\u2019s recap what happened, beginning with Comey\u2019s announcement on July 5 that the FBI had completed its investigation of Clinton\u2019s\u00a0use of personal email for government business while secretary of state. The FBI\u00a0investigation concerned whether there were any violations of federal law on the handling of classified information, and whether there had been any hacking of the email server by foreign or hostile powers.", "Comey announced that day that the FBI would not recommend that criminal charges be filed against Clinton or any State Department staffers for mishandling classified information. During his announcement, Comey said that Clinton turned over about 30,000 emails to the State Department in December 2014, but that the FBI \u201calso discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.\u201d", "Comey at the time didn\u2019t say how many total emails the FBI had recovered or exactly how many of them were work-related.\u00a0However, it was disclosed at a court hearing on Aug. 22 that the FBI had turned over about 14,900 emails to the State Department that it had uncovered during the course of its investigation. The judge, who is presiding over a\u00a0Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative Judicial Watch, ordered the State Department to expedite its review process and release any emails that are responsive to the group\u2019s FOIA request.", "In a statement to us, the\u00a0State Department said the 14,900 emails included the \u201cseveral thousand work-related emails\u201d that Comey mentioned at his July 5 press briefing. A department official told us that the FBI turned over the documents in two batches on July 21 and Aug. 5, and not all of the emails are work-related. The State Department needs to determine how many of them are work-related, although the FBI has said that \u201cseveral thousand\u201d are work-related. It may also turn out that some of these documents were already released.", "\u201cState has not yet had the opportunity to complete a review of the documents to determine whether they are agency records or if they are duplicative of documents State has already produced through the Freedom of Information Act,\u201d the State Department said in its statement.", "Trump also suggested that Clinton intentionally deleted emails to \u201ccover up her crimes.\u201d But the FBI found no evidence of a coverup.", "Comey explained how the FBI recovered the emails that Clinton did not turn over to the State Department in December 2014:", "Comey, July 5: We found those additional e-mails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private e-mail domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond. \u2026 \u00a0Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of e-mail fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013.", "Comey said the FBI \u201cfound no evidence\u201d that she deleted emails intentionally to conceal them, saying it was \u201cnot surprising\u201d that the FBI found emails that Clinton did not turn over to the State Department:", "Comey, July 5: I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our assessment is that, like many e-mail users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted e-mails or e-mails were purged from the system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government account \u2014 or even a commercial account like Gmail \u2014 there was no archiving at all of her e-mails, so it is not surprising that we discovered e-mails that were not on Secretary Clinton\u2019s system in 2014, when she produced the 30,000 e-mails to the State Department.", "So, Trump is not only wrong that the FBI \u201cjust recently found another 15,000 more\u201d emails, but he is making an unsupported claim that she deleted the emails\u00a0to \u201ccover up her crimes.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/42bce111-c331-4c5a-bd69-227c20a30aa8", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
