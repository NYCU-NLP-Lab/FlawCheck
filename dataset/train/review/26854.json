The network's Adult Swim programming block, where the show aired, confirmed on 10 January 2018 that the joke aired:", "Winfrey has been the subject of speculation regarding the chances of her mounting an actual presidential bid in the wake of her appearance at the Golden Globe Awards on 7 January 2018. She has reportedly been \"actively thinking\" about the possibility.", "As with forecasts made on another animated program (The Simpsons had an episode called \"Bart to the Future,\" which predicted a Donald Trump presidency; the show accurately made several other predictions, as well), \"Return of the King\" (written by Boondocks creator Aaron McGruder) does not focus on Winfrey; it dealt with an alternative history in which civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. emerged from a coma in 2000 instead of being killed on 4 April 1968. The episode builds to King \u2014 frustrated by the political and media climate he is forced to navigate \u2014 telling a stunned audience:", "I've seen what's around the corner, I've seen what's over the horizon, and I promise you \u2014 you n**gas won't have nothing to celebrate.

Then something unexpected happened: people got angry.", "A montage of newscasters then spells out the consequences of the speech: an \"unexplained\" decline in African-American student dropouts; a National Basketball Association players' strike demanding that U.S. troops are pulled out of an unidentified country; an apology by Black Network Television founder Robert Johnson to black Americans; a surge in \"irate\" phone calls to lawmakers' offices by African-Americans; and a large protest outside the White House that is then repelled by tear gas.", "The sequence is followed by a close-up on a newspaper headline stating that King died in the Canadian city of Vancouver, before the camera pans up to the top story announcing Winfrey's electoral victory, strongly implying that it was the culmination of the anger set off by his speech. As the episode ends, Huey can be heard saying, \"It's fun to dream.\"", "McGruder is currently producing a new show, Black America, for Amazon Studios.
