["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and Robert Farley", "Posted on April 22, 2019", "In an interview about the Mueller report, Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, distorted the facts in repeatedly making the case that there was \u201cno obstruction\u201d by Trump.", "Giuliani made his claims in an April 21 interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d \u2014\u00a0three days after the special counsel issued a\u00a0redacted report\u00a0on\u00a0the Russian government\u2019s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, whether Trump\u2019s campaign associates were involved in those efforts, and whether the president attempted to interfere with the investigation.", "The special counsel\u2019s report uncovered \u201cmultiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government,\u201d but the investigation \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d As for obstruction of justice, the Mueller report said that while it \u201cdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d", "In his defense of Trump, Giuliani claimed that Clinton, not Trump, \u201cactually obstructed justice\u201d during a federal investigation. The former New York City mayor was referring to the FBI investigation into whether Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information when she was secretary of state.", "After a yearlong investigation, then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0said\u00a0Clinton and her staff had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in handling \u201chighly classified information,\u201d but the FBI\u00a0\u201ccannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges\u201d against Clinton or any of her aides.", "\u201cAll the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here,\u201d Comey\u00a0said\u00a0at a July 5, 2016, press conference.", "Two days later, Comey testified before the House oversight committee, and Rep. William Lacy Clay of Missouri asked him, \u201cDid Secretary Clinton or any member of her staff attempt to obstruct your investigation?\u201d The FBI director replied, \u201cWe did not develop evidence of that.\u201d", "Regardless, in an attempt to favorably compare his client to Clinton, Giuliani claimed there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that Clinton committed obstruction of justice.", "Giuliani, April 21:\u00a0There was no obstruction. Nothing was denied [Mueller evidence].\u00a0Nobody crushed cell phones like Hillary did. Nobody deleted 33,000 emails like Hillary\u2019s people did, and nobody bleached a server like Hillary did.", "The FBI investigation found no proof that Clinton or her aides intentionally deleted \u201c33,000 emails\u201d by bleaching a server, crushing cell phones or any other method \u2014 contrary to Giuliani\u2019s claims.", "Let\u2019s go through the history of the case (which is also summarized in our story \u201cA Guide to Clinton\u2019s Emails\u201d).", "During a Republican-controlled House investigation into the deaths of four Americans\u00a0in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the State Department learned that it had very few emails from Clinton, who was the secretary of state at the time. As it turned out, Clinton did not use a government email account and kept her work emails on a private server at her home in New York.", "In the summer of 2014, after Clinton had already left office, the State Department contacted her office in an attempt to recover emails on her server. Her lawyers went through the emails and identified\u00a030,490 work-related emails and 31,830 personal emails.\u00a0In December 2014, about 21 months after she left office, Clinton gave the State Department the\u00a030,490 work-related emails\u00a0totaling roughly 55,000 pages. She indicated that she deleted the others. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any reason to keep them,\u201d she said at a\u00a0March 10, 2015, press conference.", "A Clinton lawyer told an employee of Platte River Networks \u2013 which was maintaining Clinton\u2019s private server \u2013 \u201cto modify the e-mail retention policy,\u201d so that emails 60 days or older would be deleted. That would have erased the personal emails that Clinton\u2019s lawyers did not turn over to the State Department at that time.", "However, the FBI\u00a0determined\u00a0during its investigation that emails identified by Clinton\u2019s lawyers as \u201cpersonal\u201d were deleted \u201csometime between March 25-31, 2015\u2033 \u2014\u00a0about three weeks\u00a0after\u00a0the House Select Committee on Benghazi served Clinton with a subpoena on March 4, 2015, to produce any emails related to its Benghazi investigation.", "Platte River Networks\u00a0used a free software program called BleachBit to delete the emails \u2014 which is what Giuliani means when he says the server was \u201cbleached.\u201d\u00a0Clinton and her lawyer told the FBI they were unaware when PRN deleted the personal emails.", "During its investigation, which\u00a0began July 10, 2015, the FBI tried to recover some of the deleted emails identified by Clinton\u2019s lawyers as personal.", "Some of the emails were recovered in \u201cthe mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server,\u201d but some could not be recovered because \u201cthe lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery,\u201d\u00a0Comey said at his July 5, 2016, press conference.", "Comey said that investigators \u201cfound no evidence\u201d that \u201cwork-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d", "\u201cWe have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort,\u201d Comey said.", "The FBI director expanded on this point during his appearance before the House oversight committee two days later\u00a0in an exchange\u00a0with GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin.", "Grothman,\u00a0July 7, 2016:\u00a0Is it possible because of what her lawyers did that they were erasing things that were incriminating, maybe involving items that yourself were not particularly investigating but these have now been destroyed forever?", "Comey:\u00a0I guess it\u2019s possible \u2014 as I said in my statement on Tuesday, we did not find evidence to indicate that they did the erasure to conceal things of any sort. But it\u2019s possible, as I said on Tuesday, that there are work-related emails that were in the batch that were deleted.", "Grothman:\u00a0I\u2019m sorry, when you go to this length to make sure you can never recover the emails who are erased, wouldn\u2019t you think the intent is to make sure nobody looks at them again? Why \u2014 why \u2014 otherwise, couldn\u2019t you just (inaudible). \u2026", "Comey:\u00a0I guess it\u2019s a bit circular. You delete because you want to delete. But that \u2014 that \u2014 what I mean is we didn\u2019t find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice.", "As for the \u201ccrushed cell phones,\u201d\u00a0the FBI said in its\u00a0notes on the investigation\u00a0(on\u00a0page 8) that Clinton used eight mobile devices while she was secretary of state. It quotes\u00a0Clinton aide Justin Cooper (on\u00a0page 9) as saying that he could recall on two occasions that he got rid of old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer.", "As we have written, security experts interviewed by the technology website Wired\u00a0said\u00a0destroying old devices is a good way to erase data \u2014 if done properly.", "Giuliani, as\u00a0Trump has done\u00a0before, suggests that Clinton or her aides intentionally destroyed the cell phones as part of a cover up.\u00a0But, as Comey said, the FBI came to no such conclusion.", "In Trump\u2019s case, Giuliani said, \u201cThere was no obstruction.\u201d But the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller didn\u2019t reach that conclusion. It said: \u201c[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.\u201d", "Mueller also did not recommend, one way or the other, on prosecution, saying there were \u201cdifficult [legal] issues that would need to be resolved,\u201d to reach a conclusion about Trump\u2019s actions. But the report describes in detail 11 \u201ckey events\u201d in which Trump may have obstructed justice. It\u00a0\u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d", "In fact, the report establishes that Trump did try to influence the investigation but was unsuccessful mainly because his underlings refused to go along with his requests.", "Mueller report: The President\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. [Former FBI Director James] Comey did not end the investigation of [Retired Lt. Gen. Michael] Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn\u2019s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. [White House counsel Don] McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President\u2019s order. [Former campaign manager Corey] Lewandowski and [Trump campaign official Rick] Dearborn did not deliver the President\u2019s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President\u2019s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President\u2019s multiple demands that he do so.", "However, Attorney General William P. Barr, along with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, concluded that the investigation didn\u2019t show that the president had committed a criminal obstruction of justice offense.", "Among the 11 \u201ckey events\u201d in the Mueller report:", "Trump\u2019s behavior regarding the FBI\u2019s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey,\u00a0\u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\u201d according to Comey\u2019s testimony. The Mueller report said, \u201cEvidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI\u2019s broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told [New Jersey Gov. Chris] Christie, that terminating Flynn would end \u2018the whole Russia thing.\u2019\u201d", "Trump\u2019s efforts to remove the special counsel. After\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported in June 2017 that the special counsel was investigating whether Trump had attempted to obstruct justice by firing Comey, Trump called White House counsel Don McGhan twice and ordered him to call Rosenstein and have Mueller removed as special counsel based on conflicts that Trump believed existed.", "Efforts to curtail the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Two days after Trump tried to have Mueller removed, the president asked his former campaign manager\u00a0Corey Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions to\u00a0limit the scope of the investigation to only foreign interference on\u00a0future\u00a0elections. Lewandowski ultimately asked Rick Dearborn, a senior White House official who had a relationship with Sessions, to deliver the message, but Dearborn didn\u2019t do so.", "Efforts to get the attorney general to take over the investigation. Trump repeatedly tried to get Sessions to reverse his recusal and take over the Russia investigation, and he wanted Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton.\u00a0In assessing the president\u2019s intent, the Mueller report said there\u2019s evidence Trump wanted Sessions to take control of the Russia investigation and \u201csupervise it in a way that would restrict its scope.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s conduct toward\u00a0Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. In press interviews and on Twitter, Trump repeatedly said Manafort, who had been indicted on multiple felony counts, was being treated unfairly, and Giuliani floated the possibility of a pardon.\u00a0\u201c[T]here is evidence that the President\u2019s actions had the potential to influence Manafort\u2019s decision whether to cooperate with the government,\u201d the Mueller report said, and Trump\u2019s public statements during the trial \u201chad the potential to influence the trial jury.\u201d As for intent, the evidence \u201cindicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government.\u201d", "For more on these and other events detailed in the Mueller report, see our April 18 story \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Obstruction.\u201d", "As for Giuliani\u2019s claim that \u201cnothing was denied\u201d to the special counsel from the Trump administration, as \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace responded, \u201cthat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u00a0Trump refused to do an in-person interview with investigators, and the Mueller report said his written responses to questions, which included more than 30 \u201cdoes not \u2018recall\u2019 or \u2018remember\u2019\u201d instances,\u00a0were inadequate. Investigators considered a subpoena but didn\u2019t want to delay an investigation that had \u201cmade significant progress\u201d at that point.", "Giuliani said, \u201cWell, they are not entitled to testimony, no prosecutor is.\u201d Wallace responded: \u201cThat isn\u2019t what you said. You said they got everything they wanted.\u201d", "Giuliani disputed the Mueller report\u2019s conclusion that Trump directed White House counsel McGahn to remove the special counsel, claiming that McGahn \u201cgave three different versions of that conversation.\u201d", "As the report lays out, though, despite pressure from Trump to recant his allegation, McGahn was consistent in maintaining that Trump told him to get rid of Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest.", "In the days after Mueller was\u00a0appointed\u00a0special counsel on May 17, 2017, Trump complained to advisers that Mueller had conflicts of interest that prevented him from conducting an impartial investigation. Several of Trump\u2019s advisers warned the president the claims of conflicts were baseless and \u201cridiculous.\u201d (We wrote about two of those in our April 19 story, \u201cDebunking Mueller\u2019s \u2018Conflicts.\u2019\u201c.)", "Nonetheless, the Mueller report states, Trump persisted, and directed McGahn to ask the Justice Department to dismiss Mueller over the purported conflicts. McGahn recalled that Trump directed him to \u201cCall [Deputy Attorney General] Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can\u2019t be the Special Counsel.\u201d McGahn said Trump told him, \u201cMueller has to go\u201d and \u201cCall me back when you do it.\u201d According to the report, \u201cMcGahn understood the President to be saying that the Special Counsel had to be removed by Rosenstein.\u201d Trump later told staffers he only wanted Rosenstein to review the conflicts. The conflicting accounts are a central piece of the report\u2019s consideration of whether the president sought to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation.", "Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about McGahn\u2019s revelations in the Mueller report, Giuliani dismissed them as \u201ca product of not telling the full story. That\u2019s not McGahn\u2019s fault. McGahn gave \u2014 when you read that, McGahn gave three different versions of that conversation.\u201d", "According to Giuliani, \u201cThe first version of that conversation is the president used the word \u2018fire\u2019 and he told the president, \u2018I\u2019m going to resign directly.\u2019 He then recants that and says no fire, no statement that I was going to resign and then he comes up with that version and then a third version which is even softer which says something like he should be fired. Or he has conflicts, he can\u2019t be special prosecutor. \u2026 It\u2019s a very complex set of facts.\u201d", "The president disputes McGahn\u2019s account, Giuliani said. \u201cThe president says, \u2018I didn\u2019t say to fire him. I didn\u2019t want him to go, I want all the conflicts to be taken into consideration.\u2019 That\u2019s the president\u2019s version. You got to pick one version or the other.\u201d", "There are, in fact, two versions: McGahn\u2019s and the president\u2019s. The report does not show McGahn \u201cgave three different versions\u201d of his conversation with Trump, as Giuliani claimed.", "On Jan. 25, 2018, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that in June 2017 Trump \u201cordered the firing\u201d of Mueller, and that Trump backed down only after McGahn \u201cthreatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.\u201d The Mueller report notes that the following day the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0repeated\u00a0the essential claims in the\u00a0Times\u00a0story, but \u201cclarified\u201d that McGahn had not told Trump directly about his intent to resign rather than carry out Trump\u2019s directive. Although the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story did not say that McGahn directly spoke to the president about his threat to resign, the Mueller report notes that the\u00a0Times\u00a0story \u201ccould be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his intention to quit, causing the President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired.\u201d", "But contrary to Giuliani\u2019s assertion, even if McGahn was a source for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story (the story relies on several anonymous sources) this is not a different \u201cversion\u201d of events from McGahn. There is no evidence that McGahn ever told the\u00a0Times\u00a0that he told the president he would resign rather than carry out the president\u2019s directive.", "Nor does the report suggest that McGahn offered a \u201csofter\u201d version of Trump\u2019s directive, as Giuliani claims.", "The Mueller report details several attempts by Trump to get McGahn to walk back the\u00a0Times\u00a0report, with McGahn refusing each time.", "The first attempt came when Trump\u2019s personal counsel called McGahn\u2019s attorney on Jan. 26, 2018, \u201cand said that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest.\u201d McGahn\u2019s attorney responded that \u201cthe\u00a0Times\u00a0story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed,\u201d and that McGahn would not comply with Trump\u2019s request to dispute the story.", "Hope Hicks, a White House communications official, recalled that the same day, Trump directed White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to contact McGahn about the story, but that McGahn again relayed that there was \u201cno need to respond\u201d to the\u00a0Times\u00a0article.", "Staff Secretary Rob Porter told investigators that on Feb. 5, 2018, Trump directed him to tell McGahn to \u201ccreate a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel.\u201d Porter said he recalled Trump saying, \u201csomething to the effect of, \u2018If he doesn\u2019t write a letter, then maybe I\u2019ll have to get rid of him.\u2019\u201d", "According to Porter, \u201cMcGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true.\u201d Porter said McGahn told him that \u201cthe President had been insistent on firing the Special Counsel and that McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told the President he intended to quit.\u201d McGahn refused to write the requested letter.", "In an Oval Office meeting the following day, Trump told McGahn that the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story \u201cdid not \u2018look good\u2019 and that McGahn needed to correct it,\u201d the report states. According to McGahn, Trump told him, \u201cI never said to fire Mueller. I never said \u2018fire.\u2019\u201d", "The Mueller report says the meeting then unfolded this way:", "Mueller report:\u00a0In response, McGahn acknowledged that he had not told the President directly that he planned to resign, but said that the story was otherwise accurate. The President asked McGahn, \u201cDid I say the word \u2018 fire\u2019?\u201d McGahn responded, \u201cWhat you said is, \u2018Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can\u2019t be the Special Counsel.\u2018\u201d The President responded, \u201cI never said that.\u201d The President said he merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do. McGahn told the President he did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, \u201cCall Rod. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.\u201d The President asked McGahn whether he would \u201cdo a correction,\u201d and McGahn said no. McGahn thought the President was testing his mettle to see how committed McGahn was to what happened. [White House Chief of Staff John] Kelly described the meeting as \u201ca little tense.\u201d", "Giuliani cites this account to claim McGahn gave different versions of his conversation with Trump, first claiming that Trump directed him to fire Mueller, and then offering another version \u201cwhich is even softer which says something like he should be fired. Or he has conflicts, he can\u2019t be special prosecutor.\u201d But this \u201cthird version\u201d is arguably the same, just with different words, with McGahn saying Trump told him, \u201cCall Rod. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.\u201d", "In his report, Mueller notes that Trump\u2019s rebuttals of McGahn\u2019s recollection were \u201ccarefully worded\u201d and that Trump focused on whether he had used the word \u201cfire.\u201d Mueller wrote that \u201csubstantial evidence supports McGahn\u2019s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed\u201d and that Trump\u2019s \u201cassertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed \u2026 runs counter to the evidence.\u201d", "The report states that McGahn has a \u201cclear recollection\u201d of Trump\u2019s directive: \u201cMueller has to go.\u201d And the report states, \u201cMcGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.\u201d The report notes that McGahn relayed to several White House staffers that in response to Trump\u2019s request, he had decided to quit, that he packed up his office and prepared to submit a resignation letter. \u201cThose acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of Justice,\u201d the Mueller report states.", "The report also notes that Trump, through his counsel, already had brought his complaints about Mueller\u2019s purported conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice, so \u201cthe President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues that already had been raised.\u201d", "The report concludes that \u201cthe President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
