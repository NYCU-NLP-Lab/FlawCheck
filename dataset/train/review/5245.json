["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on April 6, 2020", "President Donald Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. This time, the president falsely claimed that \u201cpeople with lupus\u201d who take hydroxychloroquine \u201caren\u2019t catching this horrible virus.\u201d", "While it\u2019s too early to say whether or not hydroxychloroquine has any protective effects, it\u2019s not true that no lupus patients have developed the disease. In fact, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance\u2019s registry of COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic disease had 110 validated patients, as of April 2, and 17% of them have lupus.", "\u201cWe can say that this drug is likely not 100% effective in preventing or treating COVID, and that SLE [systemic lupus erythematosus] patients should not let their guard down,\u201d Dr. Jean Liew, administrative lead for the alliance, told us in an email.", "Trump made his remarks at a coronavirus press briefing on April 4. The president has said he is a \u201cbig fan\u201d of using hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment \u2014 even though, as we have reported, there is limited evidence yet that it works.", "Trump, April 4: We\u2019re just hearing really positive stories, and we\u2019re continuing to collect the data. But I\u2019ll just speak for myself: It\u2019s been out for a long time. It\u2019s a malaria drug. It\u2019s also a drug for lupus. And there\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a study out that people with lupus aren\u2019t catching this horrible virus. They\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that\u2019s correct; maybe it\u2019s false. You\u2019re going to have to check it out.", "We did check it out.", "The White House did not offer any support for the president\u2019s claim that \u201cpeople with lupus aren\u2019t catching\u201d the coronavirus. However, there is evidence from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance that he is wrong.", "The international alliance was formed to \u201chelp guide rheumatology clinicians in assessing and treating patients with rheumatologic disease.\u201d The alliance \u2014 which is supported by the Lupus Foundation of America, Lupus Research Alliance and the American College of Rheumatology \u2014 has called on clinicians to report \u201call cases of COVID-19 in rheumatology patients, including those with mild or no symptoms.\u201d", "As of April 2, the group had information on 110 validated patients: 36% with rheumatoid arthritis, 17% with psoriatic arthritis and 17% with systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, an autoimmune disease.", "\u201cOne frequently asked question: over 25% of patients who developed a COVID-19 were on HCQ at the time of diagnosis,\u201d the group said in a tweet thread on April 2, referring to hydroxychloroquine.", "\u201cBased on early data currently available in our registry, we are not able to report any evidence of a protective effect from hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19,\u201d the group said in an April 4 tweet. To be clear, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t one \u2014 but there aren\u2019t signs so far, and ultimately, the question will have to be answered in a randomized controlled trial.", "Although the data does show that lupus patients get COVID-19, Liew cautioned us that \u201cthere are many caveats to making further inference from registry data,\u201d especially since \u201cthis is a voluntary registry and will not capture all patients living with rheumatic disease, such as lupus, who test positive for COVID-19.\u201d", "Liew also said that Trump may have been referring to an unpublished study out of China on the effects of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.", "That study, which was posted to medRxiv on March 30, said: \u201cInterestingly, through a follow-up survey, we found that none of our 80 SLE patients who took long-term oral HCQ had been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection or appeared to have related symptoms.\u201d SARS-CoV-2 is the official name of the virus that causes COVID-19.", "\u201cThe authors do not provide details about the survey, such as whether there was a larger number of lupus patients surveyed (the denominator), out of which 80 were able to respond and say they did not have COVID-19,\u201d Liew pointed out. \u201cWe cannot draw any causal conclusions from those data, either.\u201d", "In the April 4 press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked \u201cwhat you\u2019re seeing as far as lupus patients, in regards to coronavirus.\u201d Fauci said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any definitive information to be able to make any comment that that \u2014 it\u2019s an obvious good question, because it might be a way for us to get some interesting and potentially important data as to the role of those medications. But that\u2019s something that is now being looked at, but we don\u2019t have any data to be able to say anything definitively.\u201d", "That has been a consistent message from the experts: It\u2019s still unknown whether hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. More study is needed.", "Several clinical trials are planned in the U.S. to test hydroxychloroquine\u2019s ability to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such study \u2014 a multi-site clinical trial that is being led by the University of Washington School of Medicine \u2014 will seek to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results won\u2019t be known until, at best, this summer.", "Until more is known, the Lupus Foundation of America urges lupus patients \u2014 and there are about 1.5 million Americans with the disease \u2014 to protect themselves as best they can from the highly\u00a0transmissible coronavirus.", "On the day that Trump made his false claim about lupus patients, the Lupus Foundation of America put out a statement that said, \u201cThere is no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is effective in preventing a person from contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19). People with lupus should follow the guidance of their doctor and the safety guidelines being issued by the CDC.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
