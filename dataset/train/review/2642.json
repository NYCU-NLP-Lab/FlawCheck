It may be noted that in the past, Bedi\u2019s Twitter bio itself had the claim, \u201cTowed PM\u2019s car for Traffic violation\u201d. The issue came to fore again in the run-up to the 2015 Delhi assembly election when Kiran Bedi was announced as the BJP\u2019s CM candidate. Kiran Bedi in an interview with NDTV (2015) had clarified that it was SI Nirmal Singh who actually towed the car by saying, \u201cSub-inspector Nirmal Singh towed it away\u201d. At the time of the incident, Bedi was the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic in Delhi.", "An article published by NDTV in 2015 stated, \u201cIn 1982, an ambassador car that belonged to then prime minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s office was parked at the wrong spot and towed away by sub-inspector Nirmal Singh.\u201d In the video posted below, the relevant part can be heard.", "In conclusion, the photograph now viral on social media is unrelated to the alleged incident of Kiran Bedi towing the Prime Minister\u2019s car, and represents an occasion when Bedi was invited for breakfast at the Prime Minister\u2019s residence.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
