["One of the earliest versions of the claim was published on February 9, 2019, by a Facebook page called \u201cNo One Cares,\u201d which has more than 31 million followers.", "It resurfaced on the social network this year, including in this Facebook post from January 19, 2021, with more than 460\u00a0shares.", "The photo shows more than a dozen clear plastic bags containing\u00a0about 10 apples each, hanging off a white picket fence with the caption: \u201cIn Norway, people harvest their apples and hanged (sic) them in their respective fences so that the poor, the hungry and the homeless avail fruits for free. Instead of letting apples to waste (sic).\u201d", "The same photo has circulated in memes around the world, including the United Kingdom, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Canada, Brazil, UAE, China, and Ethiopia, though not in Norway itself, according to data from the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.", "By running a reverse image search, AFP Fact Check found that the image was published on September 14, 2018, by Norwegian newspaper Drammens Tidende.", "The newspaper said the photo was first published on the Facebook page of Inger Gar\u00e5s, a woman living in the town of Mjondalen, about 55 kilometres southwest of the capital Oslo. Gar\u00e5s had hung about 200 bags of apples in a week, a surplus bounty she harvested from her home orchard and which she offered for free to people passing by.", "A search on Facebook led to the original photo, as well as two others here and here, which Gar\u00e5s had posted a week before the article.", "\u201cLots of apples on the fence today, first come, first served,\u201d reads the English translation of the post.", "Contacted by AFP Fact Check, Gar\u00e5s dismissed the claim that hers was a common practice in the country.", "\u201cThis is not a very normal habit in Norway,\u201d Gar\u00e5s told AFP Fact Check. \u201cMost people only throw the fruit away; I think that\u2019s why the story took off.\u201d", "The practice is so unusual that, as Gar\u00e5s explained in the Drammens Tidende article, many passersby would double-check with her before helping themselves to a bag.", "\u201cThere are many who ask \u2018Can I really take them?\u2019 \u2018Yes, just help yourself,\u2019 I answer,\u201d she said in the article.", "Gar\u00e5s told AFP Fact Check that this year, she was only able to give away a few bags of apples as the harvest was affected by \u201ca heavy attack of worms\u201d.", "An AFP journalist based in Norway, Pierre-Henry Deshayes, also confirmed that Gar\u00e5s\u2019 gesture is uncommon in the country.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 20 years and have never seen fruit hanging off fences for anyone to take. This is clearly not common practice,\u201d Deshayes said. \u201cTruth be told, there are few poor people in Norway, and even fewer starving ones.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
