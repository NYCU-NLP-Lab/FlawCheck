Insurance\u00a0enrollment\u00a0through the ACA marketplace began Oct. 1, as scheduled, and premium credits to help people buy insurance were still available because the funding was outside the annual appropriations process.", "After 16 days, Congress approved\u00a0funding legislation on Oct. 16, 2013, to reopen the government.", "While it\u2019s true Obama didn\u2019t concede to Republicans\u2019 demands to roll back the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s misleading to say \u201cObama shut down the government to force Obamacare.\u201d The healthcare law was already in place and its financing already approved.", "Some Republicans\u00a0held\u00a0fellow Texas Sen. Ted Cruz responsible for pushing the shutdown (although he has\u00a0denied\u00a0prompting it). Cruz reportedly helped gather the support to force then-House Speaker John Boehner to pass a spending bill that would strip money from the health care law, despite the unlikely chance of it passing the Senate or being signed by Obama. Days before the shutdown, Cruz gave a 21-hour speech about the need to defund Obamacare.", "In the case of the current shutdown, Trump has refused to sign an omnibus spending bill unless it includes $5.7 billion to build his promised border wall.", "At a Dec. 11 Oval Office meeting, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Democrats \u201cwant to do the same thing we did last year, this year\u201d \u2014 meaning $1.375 billion, which was how much Congress appropriated for border infrastructure in fiscal 2018.
