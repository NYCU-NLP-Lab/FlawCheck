["A Facebook post from July 25, 2020, and shared more than 2,000 times claims to be written by an unnamed Australian nurse who\u00a0warns about the purported dangers of infrared thermometer guns.", "\u201cAre we being desensitized to be targeted at the head and also causing potential health issues by aiming an infrared ray to the pineal gland?\u201d part of it reads.", "It adds that as a medical professional, they \u201crefuse to directly target the pineal gland which is located directly in the center of the forehead, with an infrared ray. However, most people agree to go through this several times a day! Our pineal glands must be protected as it is crucial for our health both now and in the future.\u201d", "Earlier French versions of the claim were shared more than 6,000 times on Facebook. They were\u00a0debunked here.", "The posts falsely\u00a0imply\u00a0that taking someone\u2019s temperature with an infrared thermometer gun aimed at the head is harmful to the pineal gland, which is located in the brain.", "France\u2019s National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) told AFP on July 23, 2020, that \u201cthe individual tested is in no way subjected to exposure to infrared radiation during the temperature measurement\u201d.", "The thermometer captures infrared spectra or radiation emitted by the human body through a lens on a sensor. Depending on the wavelengths of the radiation received, it displays a higher or lower temperature.", "Gabrielle Girardeau, a neuroscience researcher at France\u2019s Inserm institute, told AFP on July 22, 2020, that even if infrared rays were to be directed towards the pineal gland, it is positioned too deeply in the brain for the rays to reach it.", "\u201cLight has a very low capacity to penetrate the barrier formed by the skull, even if infrared wavelengths penetrate more easily,\u201d\u00a0she said.", "The pineal gland, or epiphysis, is a small gland of about eight millimetres \u201cwhich secretes melatonin, a hormone involved in circadian rhythms, that is to say, the alternation of the phases of sleep and wakefulness,\u201d\u00a0explained\u00a0Girardeau.", "Mireille Rossel, a professor and researcher in neurosciences at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes (EPHE), said in a call to AFP on July 23, 2020:\u00a0\u201cYou would have to cross the cranial box completely to reach this small gland which is located at the center of the brain.\u201d", "Maude Beaudoin-Gobert, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University\u2019s doctor in neurosciences, told AFP on July 23, 2020, that it is the \u201ccells of the retina [which] detect light and transmit information to a certain number of relays in the brain before reaching the pineal gland\u201d. This activates the secretion of melatonin during the night.", "\u201cI think the genesis of this belief in the effect of the thermometer on the pineal gland comes from the fact that in reptiles and birds this gland is indeed just under the skull and contains photosensitive cells (and therefore sensitive to sunlight visible and infrared spectrum),\u201d\u00a0said Beaudoin-Gobert. This is not the case for mammals.", "Some of these infrared thermometers\u00a0use a laser pointer (some do not), a small light that is not composed of infrared radiation, and that \u201cserves to orient the thermometer towards the part of the body temperature one wishes to measure\u201d, adds the ANSM. But this light \u201cis weak and there are warnings not to look at the beam\u201d.", "The agency also says that it \u201chas not received any report on problems related to the use of this type of thermometer\u201d\u00a0and that \u201cthere is no basis for risks associated with their use\u201d.", "AFP Fact Check has looked into multiple claims related to the safety of thermometer guns, including claims that they cause damage to the brain or, as fact-checked in Spanish, that they cause cancer or neurological damage.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
