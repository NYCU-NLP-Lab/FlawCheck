["About this rating", "When deciding which charities to donate to, many people consider an important factor to be the \"efficiency\" of these organizations \u2014 that is, what percentage of the monies taken in by a given charity goes to funding its mission rather than being eaten up by costs such as fundraising activities, salaries, and other administrative overhead.", "The e-mail reproduced above, which began circulating in 2005 and has been re-circulated every year since then around Christmastime, attempts to steer potential donors away from inefficient charities. Unfortunately, much of the information it presents was inaccurate back in 2005, and it has grown only more so in the years since then, resulting in a misleading and outdated view of various charities. We attempt to present accurate and up-to-date information about the named charities below.", "The following efficiency information is derived from the Charity Navigator web site, the GuideStar web site and Forbes magazine's November 2009 special report on the 200 Largest U.S. Charities. Salary information is taken from Schedule J (Compensation Information) of the various charities' IRS Form 990 filings, an annual reporting return that certain federally tax-exempt organizations must file with the IRS which provides information on the filing organization's mission, programs, and finances. (In the context of this article, the term \"efficiency\" refers to the percentage of total budget/expenses that each listed organization spends on providing charitable programs and services, while the term \"compensation\" or \"pay\" includes salary, one-time payments, and deferred compensation.)", "In our annual report to the Canada Revenue Agency, we publicly disclose information about executive compensation. In the interest of greater transparency to our donors, we have gone beyond our legal requirements by disclosing that our president, Michael Messenger, currently earns the top annual base salary of $215,000 plus a combination of taxable and non-taxable benefits. The president\u2019s performance is subject to annual review by our Board of Directors, and his compensation is decided by them.", "World Vision Canada's (self-reported) efficiency is 81%, much higher than the 52% figure claimed above.", "A 2011 addendum to the original message presented the following information:", "The American Legion National Commander receives a $0.00 zero salary.\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander receives a $0.00 zero salary.\nThe Disabled American Veterans National Commander receives a $0.00 zero salary.\nThe Military Order of Purple Hearts National Commander receives a $0.00 zero salary.\nThe Vietnam Veterans Association National Commander receives a $0.00 zero salary.\nThe Wounded Warriors National Commander receives a $0.00 zero salary.", "These organizations with no salaries have donations going to help Veterans and their families and youth.", "According to the most recent available Form 990 filings, all of these statements are false and/or misleading (in large part because the National Commanders are not necessarily the top business executives of these organizations):", "Unfortunately, the six veterans-related charitable organizations mentioned above don't receive very high marks for efficiency (as determined by Charity Navigator, the BBB, or Form 990 information):", "<!--\nAdditional information:", "America's Most Efficient Charities\n(Forbes)\n\n\n-->", "UNICEF USA.  \"CEO Salary Email.\"", "American Red Cross.  \"Red Cross Statement on Inaccurate Viral Email on Charity CEO Pay.\"\r\n11 December 2012.", "United Way.  \"CEO Compensation FAQ.\"", "World Vision Canada.  \"Our Approach to Executive Compensation.\"", "Updated CEO names and salaries for several of the organizations listed.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
