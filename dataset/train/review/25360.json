Shortly after Kushner made this remark, the text on this government website was changed.", "Washington Post reporter Laura Bassett was one of the first to point out this discrepancy. On April 2, Bassett shared a video of Kushner's press conference along with a screenshot from the Strategic National Stockpile website:", "Kushner said on April 2: \"The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be states stockpiles that they then use.\"", "But the website read on April 2: \"When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.\"", "Shortly after Kushner's remarks, however, the text of this website was changed.", "On April 3, the website read instead: \"The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.\"", "Bassett, as well as several other journalists, posted screenshots showing how the website appeared before and after Kushner's remarks.", "These screenshots genuinely show how this website appeared on April 2, before Kushner's remarks, and on April 3, after his remarks. These changes can also be seen on the Internet Archive. Here's a link to the Strategic National Stockpile page archived before Kushner's comments, and a link to the page that was archived after his comments.", "A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which manages the stockpile, told CNN that these changes were in the works before Kushner's comments. The spokesperson would not comment on the record and gave this statement to CNN on condition of anonymity:", "This is language we have been using in responding to inquiries for weeks now. ASPR first began working to update the website text a week ago to more clearly explain to state and local agencies and members of the public the role of the SNS.", "Blake, Aaron. \u00a0 \"The Trump Administration Just Changed its Description of the National Stockpile to Jibe with Jared Kushner\u2019s Controversial Claim.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 April 2020.", "Dale, Daniel. \u00a0 \"Trump Administration Edits National Stockpile Website a Day After it Contradicted Jared Kushner.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 3 April 2020.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
