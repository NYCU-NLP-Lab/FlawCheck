["By Robert Farley", "Posted on March 6, 2020", "President Donald Trump has made a number of misleading statements about his decision on Jan. 31 to impose travel restrictions related to the novel coronavirus epidemic.", "Azar declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus on Jan. 31, and announced the travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. On Feb. 29, Trump expanded those travel restrictions to Iran. Trump has repeatedly boasted that his decision to impose the travel restrictions was bold and worked. But his rhetoric has sometimes stretched the facts.", "For starters, health experts say Trump was wrong to refer to the travel restrictions as a \u201ctravel ban,\u201d as he did in a telephone interview on March 4 with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. During a town hall on March 5, Trump said he \u201cclosed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected.\u201d That\u2019s not accurate.", "As Azar explained when he announced the travel restrictions on Jan. 31, the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.", "At a House subcommittee hearing on the coronavirus on Feb. 5, Ron Klain, White House Ebola response coordinator under the Obama administration, took issue with the characterization of the travel restrictions as a travel \u201cban.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a travel ban,\u201d Klain said. \u201cWe have a travel Band-Aid right now. First, before it was imposed, 300,000 people came here from China in the previous month. So, the horse is out of the barn.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no restriction on Americans going back and forth,\u201d Klain said. \u201cThere are warnings. People should abide by those warnings. But today, 30 planes will land in Los Angeles that either originated in Beijing or came here on one-stops, 30 in San Francisco, 25 in New York City. Okay? So, unless we think that the color of the passport someone carries is a meaningful public health restriction, we have not placed a meaningful public health restriction.\u201d", "Indeed, on Jan. 24, a week before the travel restrictions, the CDC confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. from people who had returned from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began.", "Furthermore, Klain said, the import of goods from China is exempt from the travel restrictions, \u201cand, of course, the people who fly the planes and drive the boats that bring those goods from China. We couldn\u2019t ban that activity. We vitally need that. Ninety percent of the antibiotics in this country come from China. All kinds of vital medical supplies \u2026 we will use to treat people. So, travel bans \u2026 that\u2019s not what we\u2019re imposing, that\u2019s not what exists.\u201d", "As part of the travel restrictions, Azar announced that any U.S. citizen returning to the U.S. who had been in Hubei Province in China in the previous 14 days would be subject to mandatory quarantine and health screening. U.S. citizens returning from mainland China outside Hubei Province were ordered to undergo health screenings and \u201cup to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they\u2019ve not contracted the virus and do not pose a public health risk,\u201d Azar said.", "At the time the restrictions were announced, there were only six confirmed cases of the novel virus in the U.S. The outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, has\u00a0now\u00a0spread to more than 70 countries, including the U.S. According to a Johns Hopkins University\u00a0case tracker\u00a0and a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0database, as of\u00a0March 6,\u00a0more than 250 people in the U.S. have been infected with the new disease, known as COVID-19, and at least 14 have died.", "Trump has repeatedly said that his decision to impose the travel restrictions on Jan. 31 was made despite objections from most of the experts on containing the spread of infectious disease.", "\u201cBut we closed those borders very early, against the advice of a lot of professionals, and we turned out to be right. I took a lot of heat for that,\u201d Trump said on March 4.", "Asked by Hannity the same day about his rationale at the time he made the decision, Trump said, \u201cI would say everybody said, it\u2019s too early, it\u2019s too soon, and good people, brilliant people, in many ways, doctors and lawyers and, frankly, a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively. And they said, don\u2019t do it.\u201d", "Trump repeated this claim at his town hall in Scranton on March 5, saying that as soon as he heard that China had a problem with the coronavirus, he asked how many people the U.S. had coming in from China. \u201cNobody but me asked that question,\u201d Trump said. Trump added that his decision to impose the travel restrictions was made \u201cagainst the advice of almost everybody.\u201d", "Everybody? Not according to Azar, who said it was the \u201cuniform\u201d recommendation of experts in his department.", "\u201cThe travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,\u201d Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. \u201cThese were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d", "The World Health Organization cautioned against the overuse of travel restrictions, but stopped short of saying that Trump\u2019s decision in the U.S.\u00a0 \u2014 or anyone else\u2019s in other countries \u2014 was inappropriate.", "\u201c[W]e reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions inconsistent with the International Health Regulations,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told its executive board. \u201cSuch restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit. So far, 22 countries have reported such restrictions to WHO. Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.\u201d", "As we said, three experts called by Democrats at a House subcommittee hearing on Feb. 5 questioned the decision. Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, was one of them.", "Nuzzo, Feb. 5: [W]e need to seriously reexamine the current policy of banning travel from China and quarantining returning travelers. All of the evidence we have indicates that travel restrictions and quarantines directed at individual countries are unlikely to keep the virus out of our borders. These measures may exacerbate the epidemic\u2019s social and economic tolls and can make us less safe. Simply put, this virus is spreading too quickly and too silently, and our surveillance is too limited for us to truly know which countries have active transmission and which don\u2019t. The virus could enter the U.S. from other parts of the world not on our restricted list, and it may already be circulating here.", "The U.S. was a target of travel bans and quarantines during the 2009 flu pandemic. It didn\u2019t work to stop the spread, and it hurt our country. I am concerned that by our singling out China for travel bans, we are effectively penalizing it for reporting cases. This may diminish its willingness to further share data and chill other countries\u2019 willingness to be transparent about their own outbreaks. Travel bans and quarantines will make us less safe if they divert attention and resources from higher priority disease mitigation approaches that we know are needed to respond to cases within the United States.", "\u2026 We often see, when we have emerging disease outbreaks, our first instinct is to try to lock down travel to prevent the introduction of virus to our country. And that is a completely understandable instinct. I have never seen instances in which that has worked when we are talking about a virus at this scale.", "Respiratory viruses like this one, unlike others\u2013they just move quickly. They are hard to spot because they look like many other diseases. It\u2019s very difficult to interrupt them at borders. You would need to have complete surveillance in order to do that. And we simply don\u2019t have that.", "During the hearing, Dr. Jennifer Bouey, chair of China policy studies at the Rand Corporation, agreed saying that the policy to restrict travel \u201cdoesn\u2019t help that much in this\u2013the current situation.\u201d", "But according to Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, those kinds of opinions were in the minority at the time the president made his decision.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who thought the travel restrictions were a bad idea early on,\u201d Offit told us in a phone interview.", "When a virus like that is restricted to one location, as it appeared to be early on, travel restrictions can lessen the odds of it spreading to this country, Offit said. Over time, however, and as cases began to be identified in the U.S., travel restrictions make much less of a difference, he said.", "Epidemiologists and former U.S. health officials told Time\u00a0that the initial travel restrictions were valid and \u201clikely helped to slow the spread of the virus. The problem, they say, is that once it was clear that the virus was within our borders officials did not pivot quickly enough to changing circumstances.\u201d", "Trump has repeatedly claimed that Democrats have \u201cloudly criticized and protested\u201d his imposition of the travel restrictions, and have called the decision \u201cracist.\u201d But while leading Democrats have been outspoken in their criticism of the president\u2019s overall response to the epidemic, very few have criticized his decision to impose limited travel restrictions.", "\u201cI took a lot of heat,\u201d Trump said during a Feb. 27 press conference. \u201cI mean, some people called me racist because I made a decision so early. And we had never done that as a country before, let alone early. So it was a, you know, bold decision. It turned out to be a good decision. But I was criticized by the Democrats. They called me a racist because I made that decision, if you can believe that one.\u201d", "At a rally in South Carolina the following day, Trump said Democrats \u201cloudly criticized and protested\u201d his decision.", "\u201cBut, anyway \u2014 but we\u2019ve done an incredible job because we closed early,\u201d Trump said in a meeting with African American leaders on Feb. 28. \u201cAnd actually, the Democrats said I was a racist. Not from black-people standpoint, but from Asian-people standpoint, from Chinese-people standpoint. They said I was a racist because I closed our country to people coming in from certain areas. They called me a racist.\u201d", "We reached out to the Trump campaign and asked for names, but we did not get a response. We scoured news clips and could find only a couple instances of elected Democrats criticizing the president\u2019s action to restrict travel.", "In the House subcommittee hearing on Feb. 5 that we referenced earlier, several witnesses called by the Democrats expressed concerns about the travel restrictions and warned they could do more harm than good.", "And at least one Democrat agreed.", "\u201cThe United States and other countries around the world have put in place unprecedented travel restrictions in response to the virus,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Eliot L. Engel. \u201cThese measures have not proven to improve public health outcomes, rather they tend to cause economic harm and to stoke racist and discriminatory responses to this epidemic.\u201d", "A day earlier, Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, who presided over the hearing, told Politico, \u201cIn our response we can\u2019t create prejudices and harbor anxieties toward one population.\u201d Bera told Politico the decision to impose travel restrictions \u201cprobably doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d given that the outbreak had already spread to several other countries by that point. \u201cAt this juncture, it\u2019s going to be very hard to contain the virus,\u201d Bera said.", "But the Democratic leaders in Congress have simply not mentioned Trump\u2019s travel restrictions.", "In a Feb. 25 tweet, Trump claimed that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u201cdidn\u2019t like my early travel closings.\u201d Trump\u2019s comment appears to be based on a fabricated tweet that circulated widely on Facebook.", "Schumer has been critical of the Trump administration\u2019s response to the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he hasn\u2019t mentioned the travel restrictions in that criticism.", "In Trump\u2019s Fox News interview on March 4, host Sean Hannity said former vice president and current Democratic challenger Joe Biden \u201caccused the president of being xenophobic, while he was trying to protect the health of the American people.\u201d", "On the day Trump imposed the travel restrictions, Biden did criticize Trump for his \u201crecord of hysteria and xenophobia,\u201d but it is unclear whether Biden was referring to Trump\u2019s travel restrictions, or Trump\u2019s overall qualifications to deal with the epidemic.", "\u201cWe have right now a crisis with the coronavirus, emanating from China,\u201d Biden said on Jan. 31 at a campaign event in Iowa. \u201cA national emergency worldwide alerts. The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. In moments like this, this is where the credibility of the president is most needed, as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d", "In an op-ed published several days prior in USA Today, Biden similarly argued: \u201cThe possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president.\u201d Biden wrote that he recalled \u201chow Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 Ebola epidemic.\u201d Trump, Biden wrote, \u201crailed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place \u2014 which quelled the crisis\u00a0and saved hundreds of thousands of lives \u2014 in favor of reactionary travel bans that would only have made things worse.\u201d", "Although Democratic leaders and Democratic presidential candidates have been highly critical of Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus, we couldn\u2019t find any examples of them directly and clearly criticizing the travel restrictions.", "In a Feb. 4 letter to Trump, Democratic Reps. Nita Lowey, chair of the Appropriations Committee, and Rose DeLauro, chair of one of the subcommittees, wrote that they \u201cstrongly support\u201d the president\u2019s decision to declare a public health emergency in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, and they specifically cited the administration\u2019s actions to impose \u201csignificant travel restrictions.\u201d", "Trump said his \u201cbold\u201d decision has since been vindicated, that it has \u201csaved a lot of lives\u201d and that because of his decision \u201cthat\u2019s why we have a very small number of people that we have to really worry about.\u201d", "At a press conference on Feb. 29 attended by Trump, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, praised \u201cthe original decision that was made by the president\u201d to impose travel restrictions to and from China.", "\u201cWe prevented travel from China to the United States,\u201d said Fauci, who has worked for multiple administrations. \u201cIf we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.\u201d", "But not everyone agrees.", "Nuzzo, the senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said there\u2019s no evidence, at least, that the travel restrictions have saved lives or reduced the number of cases in the U.S.", "\u201cWe have not seen any evidence that shows the travel restrictions stopped or slowed down transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19,\u201d Nuzzo told us via email. \u201cIt is possible that it did, but there is no evidence to show this. Rather there are a number of reasons to believe that this may very well not be the case.\u201d", "Chiefly, she said, that\u2019s because \u201cwe weren\u2019t seriously looking for cases in the US.\u201d", "\u201cIf you had mild infection, you were not tested,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cIf you had viral pneumonia not requiring oxygen but had not been to Wuhan, you wouldn\u2019t have been tested.\u201d", "\u201cPrior to the US travel restrictions, China began suspending outbound flights,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cAirlines also began canceling flights due to low travel volume. Then, the US implemented travel restrictions, which further reduced travel from China. The exception was Americans who were returning home from China. These folks were subject to quarantine upon return. A number of cases were found among these individuals. If you only test travelers from China and you greatly reduce the number of travelers coming from China, then you would be likely to not find many cases.", "\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean the virus hadn\u2019t entered the US prior to travel restrictions,\u201d Nuzzo said, as data now suggests occurred in Washington state.", "Also, she said other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren\u2019t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. \u201cwould likely not have picked it up\u201d if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t using these other countries as criteria for testing.\u201d", "A modeling study published in Science magazine on March 6, \u201cThe effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,\u201d concluded that, \u201cIn areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), travel restrictions will only modestly impact the spread of the outbreak,\u201d according to a press release for the study.", "\u201cBased on the study\u2019s results, the authors say the greatest benefit to mitigating the epidemic will come from public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility \u2013 factors like early detection, isolation, and handwashing,\u201d according to the press release.", "The authors concluded that travel restrictions introduced by the Chinese government in Wuhan in Jan. 23\u00a0 and the halting of airline flights to and from China starting in early February at first slowed the spread of the disease to the rest of the world. Even still, a large number of individuals exposed to the virus had been traveling internationally without being detected and, the authors note, the number of imported cases around the world went up in a matter of weeks.", "\u201cMoving forward we expect that travel restrictions to COVID-19 affected areas will have modest effects, and that transmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic,\u201d the authors wrote.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
