Never letting the truth ruin a good story.\" The spoof includes another made-up quote from \"Simone Williams,\" which alludes to another type of rampant Facebook posts, scams involving fake offers of merchandise giveaways:", "It\u2019s a good offer, but I\u2019ve got one here where I can get a new Range Rover, and all I have to do is share this Facebook post from a dodgy looking page. I\u2019d really hate to miss out if this one is real.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
