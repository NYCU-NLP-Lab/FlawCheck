["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 27, 2020", "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has twice botched a talking point on an already dubious claim that his proposal for a minimum corporate tax would pay for his free-tuition plan.", "Several independent tax groups that have analyzed Biden\u2019s tax plan say the corporate minimum tax would raise half (or less) what the Biden campaign estimates.", "But on two occasions in the last week, Biden has muddied things even further by flubbing the campaign\u2019s talking point on how much the tax would raise, and how much his higher education proposal would cost.", "In his interview with Norah O\u2019Donnell for CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which was taped several days before it aired on Oct. 25, Biden grossly underestimated the cost of his plan for free higher education, a point that his campaign later acknowledged Biden \u201cmisspoke\u201d about.", "Biden, Oct. 25: If we just made every corporation pay a minimum 15% tax, you got 91 pay no tax, that raises over $400 billion. I can send every single qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150 billion. I can make sure every single person who qualifies for community college can go, and we still have a lot of money left over.", "O\u2019Donnell noted that after the interview, \u201cMr. Biden\u2019s staff told us he misspoke and that the cost of free public college could be twice as much as he said.\u201d", "Several days after that interview was taped, at a rally in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 24, Biden botched the other end of the talking point, saying, \u201cIf we just make the 91 corporations that didn\u2019t pay a single penny in taxes pay 15%, that raises $40 billion. That allows us to send every single person qualified to community college free. It allows us to send every single person who can get into a four-year state university go free if they make less than $125,000.\u201d", "In fact, the Biden campaign estimates the 15% corporate minimum tax would raise $400 billion \u2014 not $40 billion \u2014 over 10 years. The campaign told us the plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000 and to provide two free years of community college will cost \u201cin the range of a few hundred billion dollars\u201d over 10 years.", "But putting aside that Biden did not correctly deliver the numbers estimated by the campaign, independent tax analysts say the campaign greatly overestimates the revenue that will be raised from its proposed corporate minimum tax.", "Biden\u2019s proposed 15% corporate minimum tax is referred to by some as a tax on companies\u2019 global \u201cbook income,\u201d or the amount of income corporations publicly report on their financial statements. According to the Tax Foundation, \u201cThis measure is useful for assessing the financial health of a business but often does not reflect economic reality and can result in a firm appearing profitable while paying little or no income tax.\u201d", "There were reports\u00a0last year, prompted by the\u00a0findings\u00a0of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, indicating that Amazon, Netflix and other companies have in some recent years paid no federal income taxes, due to various tax credits and deductions. To address this, Biden has proposed a 15% minimum corporate tax on firms with $100 million or more in net income (though companies can carry forward book losses from previous years).", "As we said, the Biden campaign estimates the tax would bring in $400 billion over 10 years. By contrast, however, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates it would raise just $108.5 billion between FY2021 and FY2030 (see Appendix, Table A1). The business-backed Tax Foundation estimates it would bring in $202.7 billion over 10 years (see Table 4). And a Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis of the Biden platform puts revenues from the tax at about $227 billion over 10 years.", "\u201cThis provision would raise more revenue if implemented without the rest of Biden\u2019s tax plan, as Biden\u2019s proposed 28 percent corporate rate would decrease the number of companies subject to the minimum tax,\u201d Penn Wharton Budget Model Senior Analyst Xiaoyue Sun told us via email. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible that, considered by itself, the minimum tax could raise what the campaign claims, but we haven\u2019t run that scenario without the rest of the Biden tax plan.\u201d", "Sun noted that since Biden\u2019s corporate minimum tax proposal would only apply to companies with net income greater than $100 million, \u201conly 47 firms that don\u2019t pay income tax under current law\u201d would be subject to the proposed tax. That\u2019s about half the number cited by Biden.", "The Biden campaign told us the tuition plan for families with incomes below $125,000 would cost \u201cin the range of a few hundred billion dollars\u201d over 10 years.", "According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, however, the tuition-free college provisions by themselves would cost substantially more than that: about $1.38 trillion over 10 years.", "The campaign says it relied on cost estimates that took a comprehensive approach to scoring Biden\u2019s higher education proposals.", "The campaign specifically cites a report headed by Anthony P. Carnevale, a research professor and director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, which concludes that Biden\u2019s free-college program \u201cwould start paying for itself within a decade.\u201d Carnevale said the proposal would cost $683.1 billion in its first 10 years, but that in the 10th year, the program would begin to pay for itself as a result of higher tax revenues from having more taxpayers in higher-paying jobs (and sharply outpace the cost in the years after that).", "We take no position on Biden\u2019s higher-education plans, of course, but during the primary Biden made a point to draw a distinction with his Democratic opponents by detailing how all of his proposals would be paid for.", "\u201cThe vice president does think it\u2019s very important to be clear with the American people regarding how you\u2019re going to pay for things in order to demonstrate they can actually get it done,\u201d Biden policy director Stef Feldman told Bloomberg in December 2019.", "There is a measure of speculation in economic estimates, and Biden\u2019s proposal to pay for higher education is part of a much larger spending and tax platform. But Biden has specifically claimed that his higher education plan would be paid for by the corporate minimum tax. And several independent tax groups have analyzed the entirety of Biden\u2019s tax plan and have concluded that provision would bring in half of what Biden says it would, and far less than it would cost to fund his tuition-free plan over the first 10 years.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
