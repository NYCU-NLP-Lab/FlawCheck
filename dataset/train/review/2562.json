Graphic by PolitiFact California", "Jessica Morse, the Democratic challenger in California\u2019s 4th Congressional district race, describes incumbent Republican Rep. Tom McClintock as \"a career politician\" whose done next-to-nothing in Congress.", "Morse, 36, is a former State Department employee and first-time candidate. McClintock, 62, is seeking a fifth term representing the largely rural district east of Sacramento. Before his time in Congress, he spent 22 years as a state lawmaker.", "Morse made another claim about McClintock that caught our attention on Twitter:", "\"I believe McClintock is beatable. Word is getting out that, like Trump, he is shamelessly dishonest and utterly ineffective; he has authored three laws since he\u2019s been in office; two renamed post offices.\"", "I\u2019m standing up to McClintock\u2019s abysmal leadership, join me!", "We decided to fact-check the portion about McClintock authoring just three laws. Was Morse right?", "Our research", "Asked about the claim, Morse\u2019s campaign said it \"was simply quoting Eric Johnson, the author of the article linked in the tweet.\"", "Johnson is the editor of the Sacramento News & Review. Morse\u2019s tweet links to his July 19 column in the publication, titled Defeat Trump\u2019s local ally.", "Morse does use quotation marks in her tweet. But she doesn\u2019t explicitly attribute it to Johnson. The impression left is that the words are hers or, at the very least, that she stands by the claim. Her tweet gives it a stamp of approval and perpetuates questionable information.", "In the past, PolitiFact has called out politicians, including President Trump, for quoting and retweeting inaccurate information on Twitter. In November 2015, for example, Trump tweeted an image packed with racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics. PolitiFact rated it Pants On Fire.", "We\u2019ll take the same approach in our examination of Morse.", "Number of bills", "Starting with the number of bills McClintock has authored that became law, Morse\u2019s statement is off.

A member of the House may not pass a measure as a freestanding bill but then be able to attach it as a part of a larger bill.\"", "Claims about members of Congress passing a small number of bills, some to rename post offices, aren\u2019t new.", "In 2016, we rated Half True now Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 claim during a debate in the race for U.S. Senate that Rep. Lorretta Sanchez had \"passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office.\"", "We found that was technically correct. But it ignored the fact that relatively few stand-alone bills introduced by members of Congress are passed on their own. Many are added as amendments to larger bills. Longtime Democratic House members Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, at that time, had sponsored a combined 10 stand-alone bills that became law during their careers.", "Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego, agreed the number of laws passed isn\u2019t the only measurement of effectiveness. Still, it\u2019s \"a reasonable way to go\" when examining a politician, he said.", "For some conservative lawmakers, passing laws isn\u2019t necessarily the goal, Kousser added.", "\"Tom McClintock is not a guy who believes you need a law for everything,\" Kousser said. \"He doesn\u2019t necessarily view a law as an accomplishment.\"", "Our ruling", "Democratic challenger Jessica Morse claimed on Twitter that GOP Rep.

Two were to rename post offices.", "Morse\u2019s claim is wrong on the number signed into law. But her tweet is\u00a0also misleading because members of Congress rarely author stand-alone bills.
