The pronoun options are she/her, he/him, they/them, other, or prefer not to share. These changes were widely praised by LGBTQ advocates.", "We visited the website and found that this was indeed the case.", "These options did not exist in the version of the website under the Trump administration as of Jan. 19, 2021, as seen through this archived link where the required prefix options were Mr., Mrs., Ms., and Dr.", "The entire White House website can now also be translated into Spanish through a blue \u201cEspa\u00f1ol\u201d button on the top right.
