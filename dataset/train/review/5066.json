["About this rating", "In December 2020, a resident of St. Anthony, Minnesota, received an anonymous letter from a neighbor that described her front-yard Christmas light display as a \u201creminder of systemic biases\u201d that may have a \u201charmful impact\u201d on others who can't afford to erect holiday displays or who may have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The letter went viral after it was shared in a tweet by Crime Watch Minneapolis, an unverified account that shares \u201cnews-info-commentary about crime, public safety, and livability in Minnesota.\u201d The group raises money through its Patreon page, which is a membership platform for artists and creators to solicit funding for projects.", "\u201cWe're working to educate the public about how our criminal justice system works,\u201d read the group\u2019s Patreon page. \u201cMinnesota\u2019s criminal justice system favors criminals over public safety.\u201d", "According to an image shared in the tweet, the letter read:", "I couldn\u2019t help but notice your Christmas lights display. During these unprecedented times we have all experienced challenges which casual words just don\u2019t describe what we\u2019re feeling. The idea of twinkling, colorful lights are a reminder of divisions that continue to run through our society, a reminder of systemic biases against our neighbors who don\u2019t celebrate Christmas or who can\u2019t afford to put up lights of their own.", "We must do the work of educating ourselves about the harmful impact an outward facing display like yours can have. I challenge you to respect the dignity of all people, while striving to learn from differences, ideas, and opinions of our neighbors. We must come together collectively and challenge these institutional inequities; St. Anthony is a community welcoming of all people and we must demand better for ourselves.", "Snopes spoke with Kim Hunt, the woman who claimed that her residence and several others in her neighborhood received the anonymous letter on Dec. 7, 2020. Hunt, who lives with her husband and two teenage sons, said that her family had strung up the lights a few weeks before receiving the letter.", "\u201cMy neighbor called me on my way to work and asked if I had gotten a strange letter addressed as \u2018neighbor\u2019 with no return address,\" Hunt told Snopes. \u201cI checked the mail and indeed saw a letter that the mailman had just delivered.\u201d", "Hunt said that she had no idea who sent the letter, and that she was \u201cshocked\u201d when she received it. She posted a photo of it to her city\u2019s Facebook group to see if anyone else got it, but did not send a photo of it to the Minneapolis Crime Watch page or to any media organization. She said that she was \u201ccompletely blown away how viral\u201d it became.", "An image of Hunt's St. Anthony home shows the holiday display. Image courtesy of Kim Hunt", "The tone of the letter was \u201cnot threatening in any way,\u201d said Hunt. A formal police report was never filed, but Hunt said that the police were interested in obtaining a copy of the letter as residents in the town of St. Anthony had reportedly received a similarly formatted anonymous letter several years prior that addressed affordable housing and racism in a similar tone.", "At the time of writing, the identity of the person who wrote the light display letter was still unknown.", "\u201cI have no idea who sent the letter,\u201d said Hunt. \u201cIs it a hoax? Is it real? We have no idea. I sure didn\u2019t send it to myself and in no way did I ever dream this would make national news.\u201d", "And because the letter is anonymous, there is a chance that someone may have sent it to incite divisiveness during the 2020 holiday season rather than expressing authentic concern.", "The so-called \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d became a theme during U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 bid for presidency, in which the then-Republican candidate promised to \u201cbring back\u201d the holiday greeting \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d \u2014 a term that he claimed had been steamrolled by political correctness and replaced with \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d", "Indeed, in the years leading up to the 2020 holiday season, a number of false claims circulated the internet, from claiming that a Starbucks manager threatened to fire employees who wished customers a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d to the unfounded accusation that a Muslim mayor of a Michigan town outlawed Christmas in 2017.", "Correction [Dec. 11, 2020]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Crime Watch Minneapolis was a 501(c)(3).", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
