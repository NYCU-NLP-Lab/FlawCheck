After a thorough investigation, the Purcellville Police Department identified the juveniles involved, notified their parents, and subsequently interviewed the subjects.  The two juveniles questioned admitted to their involvement, and it was determined that there was no criminal intent.  The investigation concluded the teenagers were getting close to other patrons and coughing into their own sleeves, while filming it on their phones.
