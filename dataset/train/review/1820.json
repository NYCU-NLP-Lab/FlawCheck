["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on February 15, 2019", "On Feb. 7, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced her Green New Deal in\u00a0the House and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a companion resolution in\u00a0the Senate.", "The text of the legislation, which is a nonbinding resolution, lays out a broad vision for how the country might tackle climate change over the next decade, while creating high-paying jobs and protecting vulnerable communities.", "Unlike a bill, this type of legislation is not presented to the president and cannot become law. Even if the Green New Deal passed in one or both chambers of Congress, separate legislation would have to be introduced to make any of the resolution\u2019s goals a reality.", "Much of the response to the proposal has focused on details that don\u2019t appear in the resolution text. President Donald Trump, for example, suggested on Feb. 9 in a tweet that the plan would \u201cpermanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military.\u201d", "I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called \u201cCarbon Footprint\u201d to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military \u2013 even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2019", "Two days later, at a rally in El Paso, Trump repeated some of those claims, saying that he really doesn\u2019t like \u201ctheir policy of taking away your car, taking away your airplane flights, of \u2018let\u2019s hop a train to California,\u2019 of \u2018you\u2019re not allowed to own cows anymore!\u2019\u201d", "Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming made similar claims when she warned in a subcommittee hearing on Feb. 12 that the Green New Deal would \u201coutlaw\u201d plane travel, gasoline, cars and \u201cprobably the entire U.S. military.\u201d", "The Green New Deal doesn\u2019t call for any of these prohibitions. But documents\u00a0about\u00a0the resolution released by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office did address some of the issues raised by Trump and others.", "In a Feb. 8 interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, an adviser to Ocasio-Cortez incorrectly said that an FAQ document promising all Americans economic security, even if they were \u201cunwilling to work,\u201d was doctored, and was not put out by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office. Although the resolution does not include that language, it was part of a fact sheet Ocasio-Cortez provided to media outlets and at one time was available on a blog post on the representative\u2019s website. Her adviser,\u00a0Robert Hockett, later admitted he was wrong.", "Here we explain what the Green New Deal includes \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 and why there is confusion over some of the content.", "The Green New Deal is modeled in part after Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, which was a large federal program designed to stabilize the economy and recover from the Great Depression. The Green New Deal focuses on tackling climate change, but isn\u2019t concerned just with reducing emissions.", "There are five goals, which the resolution says should be accomplished in a 10-year mobilization effort:", "The primary climate change goal is to reach net-zero greenhouse emissions in a decade. \u201cNet-zero\u201d means that after tallying up all the greenhouse gases that are released and subtracting those that are sequestered, or removed, there is no net addition to the atmosphere.\u00a0The goal, then, is slightly less ambitious than calling for no greenhouse gas emissions at all.", "In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in a special report that in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \u2014 and thereby avoid many climate change impacts \u2014 the world would have to reach net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2050.", "The resolution goes on to propose additional aims and projects to accomplish these overarching goals, but generally does not stipulate how the country will reach them. The resolution is also silent on cost and funding mechanisms.", "We\u2019ll go through some of the specific topics that have received the most attention.", "One of the most ambitious and prominent goals of the Green New Deal is to meet \u201c100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\u201d", "The resolution doesn\u2019t offer any more details, other than to say that this would include \u201cdramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power sources\u201d and \u201cdeploying new capacity.\u201d", "One point of confusion has been what sorts of energy sources the Green New Deal would allow for electricity generation. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released an\u00a0FAQ document that specifically said that new nuclear plants would not be permitted, although existing nuclear plants could stay. And in response to a question about carbon capture, utilization and storage, or CCUS, the fact sheet read, \u201cWe believe the right way to capture carbon is to plant trees and restore our natural ecosystems. CCUS technology to date has not proven effective.\u201d", "But the text of the resolution does not mention nuclear power or carbon capture, and as written, does not prohibit either method of generation.", "In a press conference on Feb. 7 announcing the proposal, Markey told reporters that the fact sheet\u2019s thoughts on nuclear power were not part of the resolution. He also added that while the resolution doesn\u2019t mention carbon capture, \u201cwe are open to whatever works.\u201d", "The power sector is one of the biggest contributors to the nation\u2019s carbon footprint, although in recent years emissions have begun to fall. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, generating electricity accounts for about 28 percent of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.", "If the country wants to reach net-zero emissions in a decade, one of the most important areas in which emissions reductions need to occur is transportation. Transportation\u00a0recently surpassed power generation as the sector with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, and is responsible for about 28 percent of the U.S. total.", "As with electricity generation, the text of the resolution that discusses transportation is open-ended. The Green New Deal requires \u201coverhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in\u2014 (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and (iii) high-speed rail.\u201d", "Some people, including the president, have said that the Green New Deal gets rid of cars or air travel. And as we\u2019ve detailed elsewhere, some popular memes online have even suggested that the plan advocates building \u201ctrains over the oceans.\u201d", "The resolution does not call for that. It only states that transportation emissions should be reduced \u201cas much as is technically feasible,\u201d and suggests three ways of reaching that goal, including high-speed rail and zero-emission vehicles, which would include electric cars. There is no mention of air travel.", "But air travel was mentioned in various FAQ materials produced by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office.", "In one FAQ that was given to NPR, one of the highlighted projects was to \u201ctotally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle.\u201d", "At another point, the FAQ was trying to explain why the goal was net-zero emissions, rather than none at all, and said that was \u201cbecause we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\u201d", "Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s communications director, said in a phone interview that any such interpretation of the fact sheets was not intended. \u201cObviously, no, we\u2019re not trying to ban air travel,\u201d he said.", "Trent iterated that the Green New Deal does not include details in any other documents. \u201cThe resolution is what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d he said.", "A third major industry the Green New Deal targets is agriculture. About 9 percent of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gases stem from agricultural activities, including the release of nitrous oxide from soil and methane from livestock.", "Once again, the agriculture section of the resolution is vague, stating only that one of the goals of the Green New Deal is \u201cworking collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible, including\u2014 (i) by supporting family farming; (ii) by investing in sustainable farming and land use practices that increase soil health; and (iii) by building a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food.\u201d", "Although the resolution doesn\u2019t say anything about cows, the animal is frequently mentioned by critics of the Green New Deal. The president referenced cows twice \u2014 once in his tweet, and again in El Paso.", "And on Feb. 12, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming incorrectly\u00a0said\u00a0livestock would be banned and that ice cream was \u201canother victim\u201d of the proposal. \u201cSay goodbye to dairy, to beef, to family farms to ranches,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican favorites like cheeseburgers and milkshakes will become a thing of the past.\u201d", "Cows were discussed in two FAQ documents, which likely explains the preoccupation. As mentioned earlier, the fact sheet sent to NPR reads, \u201cWe set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\u201d", "The same idea also appeared in a blog post on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s website, although the language was tweaked to omit \u201cfarting.\u201d The post was taken down and no longer appears.", "Cows are one of several animals that produce methane as a result of digesting food. In a process known as enteric fermentation, microbes in the cow\u2019s stomach help break down cattle feed, releasing the gas. The majority of the gas is actually exhaled from the mouth, or belched, not released from the back end.", "In the U.S., methane production from livestock accounts for almost a third of the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, and more than a quarter of all methane emissions. Methane is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a century.", "Along with its environmental goals, the Green New Deal aims to provide economic security for Americans.", "One of the proposal\u2019s key goals is to \u201ccreate millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.\u201d The plan also guarantees \u201ca job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\u201d", "Both FAQ sheets \u2014 the version sent to NPR and the one posted to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s website \u2014 however, go further, and include a provision guaranteeing economic security to \u201call who are unable or unwilling to work.\u201d", "There is nothing in the Green New Deal about providing for people who are \u201cunwilling to work,\u201d but the inclusion in the FAQ materials has proven to be one of the most contentious aspects of the Green New Deal\u2019s rollout.", "In his Feb. 8 interview\u00a0on Fox News, Hockett, a Cornell law professor and adviser to Ocasio-Cortez, falsely said that no materials released by the congresswoman included the \u201cunwilling to work\u201d language, and must have come from a doctored version.", "He later told the Daily Caller that he had been mistaken, and had been thinking of a doctored version of the Green New Deal that Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted about. That fake version of the Green New Deal falsely claimed that men would be required to urinate in \u201can empty milk jug instead of a toilet.\u201d", "On Feb. 9, after a Washington Post reporter noticed the disconnect, Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter, noting that there were various versions of the Green New Deal and the FAQs.", "There are multiple doctored GND resolutions and FAQs floating around. There was also a draft version that got uploaded + taken down. There\u2019s also draft versions floating out there.", "Point is, the real one is our submitted resolution, H.Res. 109: https://t.co/ZlgWmNQn57", "\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 9, 2019", "Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff, also replied, saying that \u201can early draft of a FAQ that was clearly unfinished and that doesn\u2019t represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake.\u201d", "There separately IS a doctored FAQ floating around. And an early draft of a FAQ that was clearly unfinished and that doesn\u2019t represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake (idea was to wait for launch, monitor q's, and rewrite that FAQ before publishing).", "\u2014 Saikat Chakrabarti (@saikatc) February 9, 2019", "\u201cMistakes happen when doing time launches like this coordinating multiple groups and collaborators,\u201d he added. \u201cBut what\u2019s in the resolution is the GND.\u201d", "Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s communications director, told us,\u00a0\u201cThere was a mistake on the FAQ,\u201d and said that he was personally responsible, but would not comment further.\u00a0He pointed us to Chakrabarti\u2019s Twitter thread and the resulting\u00a0Washington Post article, which he said explained things well.", "Whether done accidentally or not, much of the confusion about what the resolution contains originates from discrepancies between the official resolution and documents that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office distributed to news outlets and posted on her website, not because of \u201cdoctored\u201d copies.", "The president\u2019s Feb. 9 tweet\u00a0also suggested that the Green New Deal would \u201cpermanently eliminate\u201d the military. But the resolution does not mention the military at all, and neither do any of the FAQ materials Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released or posted.", "Where did the idea come from? When we contacted the White House, the press office did not provide us with an on-the-record explanation. But one possibility is a separate proposal by the Green Party of the United States. The party\u2019s policy also goes by the name \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and includes cutting military spending \u201cby at least half\u201d and closing military bases overseas, although it does not call for a complete end to the military.", "Despite some similarities, the two plans are distinct and should not be conflated.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
