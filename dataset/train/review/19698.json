It also floats the debunked idea that the virus was \"laboratory-created, possibly as a bioweapon.\"", "\"Why does Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s name appear on 4 U.S. patents for a key glycoprotein that appears to have been inserted into a SARS virus chassis to create the current COVID-19 epidemic?\" Corsi wrote.", "The article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

He has made baseless allegations about former President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate and spread misinformation related to QAnon, a broad\u00a0right-wing conspiracy theory.

That method includes \"a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that interferes with the interaction of gpl20 and \u03b14 integrin ... thereby treating the HIV infection.\"", "In plain English: the potential treatment aims to impede a chemical interaction between HIV and human cells that can lead to transmission of the virus.
