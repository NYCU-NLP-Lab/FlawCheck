John McCain, as well as an accusation that he mocked a disabled reporter who has a physical impairment, which Trump denied.", "Trump fired back that Bush has been a potty mouth but has gotten away with it.", "\"Two days ago, he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody,\" Trump said Feb. 13. \"And that's fine -- nobody reports that. He gets up and says that. And then he tells me that, oh, my language was a little bit rough.\"", "Did Bush really say such a thing, and did the press ignore it? Trump\u2019s recounting of the facts is pretty selective.", "Bush\u2019s comment about mooning", "Trump\u2019s spokeswoman referred us to a a Feb. 6 article by Matt Viser in the Boston Globe a few days before the New Hampshire primary. The main point of the article was that Bush had to do well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or he would face pressure to end his campaign.", "\"Sitting on his campaign bus \u2014 laptop, turkey jerky, and coffee all nearby \u2014 Jeb Bush was befuddled over his campaign\u2019s failure to capture more attention from the news media.", "\"I could drop my pants,\" he said in an interview. \"Moon the whole crowd.
