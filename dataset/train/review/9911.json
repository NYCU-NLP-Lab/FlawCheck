["About this rating", "On 14 December 2017 a rapidly-moving Facebook rumor appeared to claim that a high-profile Senate race in Alabama two days before, in which Republican pick Roy Moore (who lost the election) received 953 votes and Doug Jones earned 5,327 \u2014 in a town of just 1,867 registered voters:", "Early versions provided a name of the town (Bordalama), but most simply stated the purported tallies and nearly none of them had any corroborating information at all:", "According to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn\u2019t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama.", "Although the rumor spread like wildfire, most of its appearances didn't include a town name (and the ones that did include the town named \"Bordalama,\" which does not exist) or any identifying details. The source of the claim was an article published by LadiesofLiberty.net, which mentioned the also nonexistent \"State Election Board of Voting Integrity\":", "The State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that \u201cmore than a third\u201d of Jones\u2019 votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious \u2014 and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham.", "According to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town.
