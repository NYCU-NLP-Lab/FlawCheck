In India, seven girls died during vaccine trials, as reported in the local media and by the academic journal\u00a0Science Magazine.

This was also reported\u00a0by The Lancet medical journal.", "The trials were halted, and the Indian government set up a committee\u00a0to investigate. It\u00a0concluded that there were some irregularities in the administration of the vaccines.

There are no records of bullying, pressuring village girls, or refusing medical care. The government, however, said the organisations in charge of the vaccinations violated some ethical standards.", "Kennedy\u00a0also claims\u00a0that South African newspapers said \u201cwe are guinea pigs for drugmakers\u201d\u00a0and that South African geopolitics professor Patrick Bond called Gates \u201cruthless\u201d\u00a0and \u201cimmoral\u201d.

This is misleading.", "The Gates Foundation did not mandate the use of 50 polio vaccine doses for children in India.

According to the WHO, India was the first country in the world to introduce fractional-dose inactivated poliovirus vaccine into its immunisation programme in 2016.", "The post alleged that \u201cin 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines\u201d.

The UN health agency says the vaccine is safe.", "This claim has been extensively debunked by AFP Fact Check here.", "Kennedy also claimed that the Gates Foundation funded a trial in 2010 of an experimental malaria vaccine by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.

More about the vaccine trials can be found here and here.", "In Africa,\u00a0misinformation portraying vaccines as harmful or even part of a plot to kill black people have fuelled a mistrust of western medical research, as AFP Fact Check investigated\u00a0here.", "Citing a study by Morgensen et.al., 2017, Kennedy claims that the WHO\u2019s Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTP) vaccine is killing more people than the diseases it is meant to prevent.

Multiple studies funded and co-funded by the UN health agency in four countries do not back up the claim.", "\u201cAll the studies show reduced mortality rates in the children vaccinated with all of the vaccines.
