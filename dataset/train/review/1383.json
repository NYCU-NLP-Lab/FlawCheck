["Paul Babeu, the Republican Sheriff of Pinal County, Ariz., near the U.S.-Mexico border, has repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for its lack of border security.", "Babeu, who\u2019s running for Congress this November against a\u00a0Republican field that includes\u00a0David Gowan, Ken Bennett and Wendy Rogers, warned of Mexican drug cartels in his county ahead of Memorial Day weekend on Fox News\u2019\u00a0Hannity\u00a0on\u00a0May 26.", "But he also used the interview to make a political jab, questioning Obama\u2019s priorities.", "\"The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming,\" Babeu said. \"It\u2019s not an unsecured border, it\u2019s not the terrorists we should be fighting and defeating.\"", "This is not the first time we have heard a statement like this:", "In June 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker claimed Obama said global warming is the \"No. 1 threat to the military and world today.\" The president has said global warming is a serious threat, but it is not No. 1. We rated it Mostly False.", "We wondered whether Babeu\u2019s claim\u00a0holds any weight a year later.", "Contrary to Babeu\u2019s claim, the president\u2019s top national security threat appears to be terrorism.", "Out of context", "In March, after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Obama said, \"I\u2019ve got a lot of things of my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL.\"", "When we asked for evidence on climate change being the top priority, Tim Gaffney, a spokesman with the Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office, noted that Obama has made this claim during speaking engagements.", "Obama has said global warming is a serious threat and has linked it to national security. But, looking back at news reports over the last year, Obama has never explicitly said it was the top national security threat.", "Rather, he has said global warming is a threat to the whole world.", "In an April 2015 weekly address, he said \"there\u2019s no greater threat to our planet than climate change.\"", "In May 2015,\u00a0Obama also said during a U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement address that climate change \"is one of those most severe threats.\"", "\"So I\u2019m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security,\" Obama said. \"And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country.\"", "We should also point out that the U.S. military has focused on the potential threat of climate change going back to President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.", "In a December 2015 interview, Obama defended his remarks on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists will be \"defeated,\" climate change is the \"kind of crisis that we can\u2019t deal with through the deployment of Marines.\"", "Our ruling", "Babeu said, \"The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming.\"", "Obama continues to cite climate change as a great threat to the world, but framing the issue as the country\u2019s top national security threat is an exaggeration. Obama has said fighting terrorism is his most urgent priority.", "The Arizona sheriff ignores important context, so we rate his claim as Mostly False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0cb68a01-985c-4db8-96bb-cc03740e77a6", "Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, \"Remarks during Fox News\u2019 \u2018Hannity,\"\" May 26, 2016", "ABC15, \"Sheriff Paul Babeu to run for Congress,\" Oct. 5, 2015", "ABC15, \"Hikers, campers warned about assassins in parts of Pinal County,\" May 23, 2016", "PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"Scott Walker says Barack Obama told Coast Guard global warming is top threat to military and world,\" June 25, 2015", "CNN, \"Obama: No greater threat to future than climate change,\" Jan. 21, 2015", "Bloomberg, \"Obama: \u2018No greater threat\u2019 to planet than climate change,\" April 19, 2015", "The White House, \"Remarks by the president at the United States Coast Guard Commencement,\" May 20, 2015", "The White House, \"President Obama: \u2018My top priority is to defeat ISIL,\" March 23, 2016", "The Washington Post, \"Making terrorism link, Obama says climate instability can lead to \u2018dangerous\u2019 ideology,\" Dec. 4, 2015", "The Washington Post, \"Military sharpens focus on climate change,\" April 15, 2007", "Interview with Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Tim Gaffney, May 27, 2016", "Interview with White House spokesman Eric Schultz, May 31, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
