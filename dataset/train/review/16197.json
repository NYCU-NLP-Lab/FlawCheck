Pedophile.\u201d", "The US election campaign of 2020 saw Biden subjected to a flood of social media posts branding him a pedophile.

Joe Biden was born on November 20, 1942. The US president is therefore eight-and-a-half years older than his wife, making the age difference mentioned in the claim impossible.", "According to media reports -- including a Vogue interview published in 2016 and a post from Jill Biden\u2019s official Twitter account, here -- Jill and Joe went on their first date in 1975. A New York Times article even specifies their love story started in March of that year. She was therefore almost 24 years old, Joe Biden was 32. The two married on June 17, 1977.", "\u201cSenator Joseph R. Biden Jr has said he first saw pictures of Jill Jacobs in March 1975 in an advertisement for a local park in Wilmington, Del,\u201d the Times\u2019 article says.", "In an interview with CNN in 2012, the now-First Lady said she had previously briefly met her future husband at a social event \u201cbut we were in a crowd and it was at a fundraiser.

Right before the election, in \u201972,\u201d he claimed, and he first suspected an affair in 1974. Jill Biden denied the allegations.", "Regardless of the veracity of the claim, Jill would not have been 15 in 1972 or 1974, but 21 and 23 respectively.", "Neilia Hunter, the US president\u2019s first wife, and their infant daughter Naomi died in a car accident in 1972, leaving the newly-elected US Senator a single father to two young sons, Beau and Hunter.", "The image used in the posts to describe how \u201cshe was 15 and he was in his 30\u2019s\u201d is a genuine photo.", "Jill Biden, herself, shared the picture on her Twitter account in August 2020, here.", "But it dates from 1976, according to the caption of the photo credited to the Biden campaign. In the image, Jill Biden must have been 24 to 25 years old, and Joe Biden 33 to 34 years old.
