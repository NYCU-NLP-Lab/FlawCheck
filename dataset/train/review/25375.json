["Sen. Ted Cruz and Jay Leno.", "After leading the charge for a government shutdown to defund President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hasn\u2019t shied away from the spotlight.", "On Nov. 8, 2013,\u00a0Cruz was a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Long before he got to the obligatory joke about reading\u00a0Green Eggs & Ham\u00a0during a lengthy Senate speech, he addressed gun policy.", "\"Do you target violent criminals, or do you try to take away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens?\" Cruz said.", "After the senator criticized Obama for focusing on the latter at the expense of the former, he praised predecessor George W. Bush\u2019s efforts.", "\"Under President Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama,\" Cruz said. \"They\u2019re not targeting bad guys.\"", "We decided to see how the numbers differed under the two presidents.", "Ways to read the data", "Let\u2019s break down the number of federal prosecutions by year. We\u2019ll start with fiscal year 2002, since that represents Bush\u2019s first full year in office. Fiscal year 2012 is the most recent year we have data for.", "There are two different sets of statistics we can look at. Cruz\u2019s spokeswoman referred us to the\u00a0Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data-gathering organization. This data tracks federal gun prosecutions by the lead, or most serious,\u00a0charge.", "On the other hand, the\u00a0Department of Justice\u2019s United States Attorney\u2019s Office\u00a0tracks all charges, a more inclusive category of prosecutions. Their data set includes everyone who was charged with a gun crime. The lead charge category only includes people whose most serious offense\u00a0was gun-related, a distinction that omits thousands of charges each year.", "Cruz\u2019s spokeswoman also told us that Cruz\u2019s claim didn\u2019t take into account numbers for Bush\u2019s entire term: He used 2004, the high-water mark for lead gun prosecutions during the time period, as his starting point.", "We\u2019re left with four ways to calculate the percent change:", "\u2022\u00a0Lead charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 2.2 percent decrease", "\u2022\u00a0Lead charges from 2004 to 2012, which gives us a 29.4 percent decrease", "\u2022\u00a0All charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 10.3 percent\u00a0increase", "\u2022\u00a0All charges from\u00a02005 (the high-water mark of this data set) to 2012, which gives us a 10.2 percent decrease", "This makes clear how\u00a0Cruz got his 30 percent decrease. However, that\u2019s not the only, or necessarily the best, approach.", "None other than TRAC\u2019s co-director, Susan Long, told PolitiFact that her organization\u2019s use of lead charges isn\u2019t as comprehensive as using all charges. She also called Cruz\u2019s 2004 start date misleading, since it amounts to cherry-picking.", "The most reliable number may be\u00a0the 10.3 percent increase in gun prosecutions between fiscal years 2002 and 2012. This rate\u00a0actually indicates the trend moving in the opposite direction from what Cruz asserted.", "Who\u2019s responsible?", "In addition to highlighting a numerical difference in federal gun crime prosecutions, Cruz specifically suggested that Obama\u2019s policies are responsible\u00a0for the decrease. But how much influence does the president really have on the issue?", "Experts say:\u00a0not much.", "\"The Bush administration was all over the map,\" Long said. \"Those trends really are being driven by something other than presidential policy,\" since the peaks and valleys don\u2019t coincide with\u00a0presidential terms, she said.", "As we\u2019ve noted\u00a0in a previous fact check, the president, as the head of the executive branch, can order changes to prosecutorial priorities. For instance, following the Newtown, Conn. school shooting in December 2012, Obama did\u00a0call for\u00a0the need to \"maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime.\"", "We don\u2019t yet have data that reflects prosecutions in the aftermath of Newtown. But it\u2019s important to note that Obama\u2019s priorities are not the only factors at play in these decisions. Any presidential shift in policy must filter down to the attorney general, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, and front-line attorneys, said Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service.", "U.S. attorneys can decline to prosecute gun cases for a variety of reasons,\u00a0as outlined by TRAC.", "So Obama is responsible for setting the broad policy approach to gun prosecutions, but he isn\u2019t micromanaging individual cases. Much of the decision-making occurs at a lower level.", "Our ruling", "Cruz said prosecution of gun crimes under the Bush administration was 30 percent higher than it is under Obama.", "It\u2019s possible to get a decline that big by cherry-picking the data, but the most inclusive method actually produces an increase. Cruz also overstates the role of the president in determining prosecution rates.\u00a0We rate Cruz\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "Mediaite, \"Ted Cruz talks Obamacare, shutdown, and gun control in lively interview with Leno,\" Nov. 9, 2013", "Email interview with Allison Price, Department of Justice spokeswoman", "Phone interview with Ronald Frandsen, Regional Justice Information Service grants administrator, Nov. 14, 2013", "Phone interview with Roseanna Ander, University of Chicago Crime Lab executive director, Nov. 11, 2013", "Phone interview with Susan Long, Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse director, Nov. 11, 2013", "PolitiFact, \"GOP Sen.
