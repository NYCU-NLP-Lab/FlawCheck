["About this rating", "As a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, a number of individuals were spotted carrying plastic zip-tie handcuffs, or zip cuffs, which have been described as a common kidnapping and restraining tool.", "Investigations in the aftermath of the rioting showed growing evidence that some of the people carrying zip cuffs intended to kidnap and \u201ctake hostages.\u201d", "But conservative commentator Ben Shapiro appeared to downplay the purpose of the zip ties in the attack on the Capitol. In a tweet (archived here) responding to New York Times\u2019 editor Lauren Wolfe\u2019s question, \u201cDo regular humans actually buy zip-ties?\u201d he said, \u201cLiterally every regular human I know owns zip ties.\u201d", "This was an authentic tweet posted to Shapiro's timeline. While Wolfe deleted her tweet, she posted later to clarify she meant to write flex cuffs instead of zip ties:", "Shapiro\u2019s tweet remained posted and he retweeted others supporting his zip tie comment, including one that said Wolfe \"deleted her tweet because she didn\u2019t know what zip ties were either.\" He received criticism for appearing to downplay the seriousness of the threat that the people with zip ties posed.", "Shapiro also said \"This is like Pauline Kael on steroids,\" referring to the famed and sharply opinionated film critic.", "In a previous Snopes fact check, we noted that the zip ties photographed in the Capitol specifically appeared to be zip-tie handcuffs, also referred to as zip cuffs, plastic handcuffs or flex cuffs. The zip cuffs wielded by one of the rioters were revealed by the attorney\u2019s office of the District of Columbia to have commonly been used as restraints by law enforcement.", "While zip ties are also used in homes for storage and more, ongoing investigations suggest that the people carrying zip cuffs in the Capitol had more nefarious intentions.", "Given that Shapiro\u2019s tweet is still up from his verified account, we rate this claim as a \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
