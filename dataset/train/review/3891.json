He criticized a statement made by a presidential nominee as Islamophobic.", "In June 2017, Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized a presidential nominee\u2019s statement that Muslims have a \u201cdeficient theology\u201d and \u201cstand condemned\u201d because \u201cthey have rejected Jesus Christ.\u201d Sanders said nothing about Christianity being an insult to Muslims.", "The exchange between Sanders and Russell Vought \u2014 which happened during a\u00a0hearing on Vought\u2019s nomination to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 has been twisted to make this claim: \u201cBernie Sanders Says Christianity Is An Insult To Muslims.\u201d", "That headline has been posted on partisan websites since at least November 2017, with periodic bursts of popularity when it is reposted and shared on social media.

You wrote: \u201cMuslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.\u201d Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?", "Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. I am a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith. That post, as I stated in the questionnaire to this committee, was to defend my alma mater, Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith that includes the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation, and \u2014", "Sanders: Again, I apologize. Forgive me. We just do not have a lot of time. Do you believe that people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view?", "Vought: Again, Senator, I am a Christian, and I wrote that piece \u2014", "Sanders: Well, what does that say \u2014", "Vought [continuing]: In accordance with the statement of faith of Wheaton College.", "Sanders: I understand that. I do not know how many Muslims there are in America. I really do not know, probably a couple million. Are you suggesting that all of those people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned, too?", "Vought: Senator, I am a Christian. I \u2014", "Sanders: I understand you are a Christian, but this country is made up of people who are not just\u2013I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?", "Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian that is how I should treat all individuals \u2014", "Sanders: And do you think your statement that you put into that publication, \u201cThey do not know God because they rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned,\u201d do you think that is respectful of other religions?", "Vought: Senator, I wrote a post based on being a Christian and attending a Christian school that has a statement of faith that speaks clearly with regard to the centrality of Jesus Christ in salvation.", "Sanders: I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who is what this country is supposed to be about.
