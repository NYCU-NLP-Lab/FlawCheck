In fact, 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin voted exclusively in Democratic primaries from 2006 through 2012, with 22 percent participating exclusively in Republican primaries, according to numbers that Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin ran for us.", "Voting in a primary election doesn\u2019t necessarily prove someone\u2019s political lean, though in Texas it\u2019s the closest signal available from voting records. Texans do not register to vote by party affiliation; anyone can vote in either primary, even switching from election year to election year.", "In Austin, where many down-ticket races field no Republican opposition, sometimes the only way a voter can affect the outcome is by choosing between Democratic candidates in the primary. In the same way, it often makes sense for voters in, say, Midland, to commit to the county\u2019s Republican primary.", "Council races in Austin are nonpartisan, and while city ordinance says the commission should have \"diversity by race, ethnicity, gender and geography,\" it doesn\u2019t specify any restrictions on members\u2019 politics. But we looked into whether Ryan got the commission members\u2019 votes right.", "In November 2012, Austinites voted to switch the council from seven citywide members to 10 district representatives and a mayor, starting with the November 2014 election.", "Some 550 people applied to be on the 14-member commission that will draw the new districts\u2019 maps by Dec. 1, 2013. A panel narrowed the pool to 60 finalists, then city staffers drew names at random, according to the city\u2019s website.

Afterward, he said, he got curious about the other eligible applicants and calculated that 55 percent voted in the 2012 Democratic primary and 24 percent voted in the Republican primary.", "He started his research, Ryan said, with information from the commission applications the city posted online. Then he matched each applicant\u2019s information to his own voter database, which he said he compiled from information kept by county clerks\u2019 offices and the Texas secretary of state, the state\u2019s chief elections officer.", "The applicants whose names were drawn for the commission were Magdalena Blanco, Mariano D\u00edaz-Miranda, Rachel Farris, Phil Hewitt, Carmen Llanes Pulido, Art Lopez, Anna Saenz and Maria Solis.", "All except Llanes Pulido were registered Travis County voters from 2006 through 2012; according to Smith\u2019s records, Llanes Pulido was registered in Travis from 2007 through 2012.
