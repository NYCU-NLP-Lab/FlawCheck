Hall Jr. made his biggest splash in a Dec. 6, 2014, speech accepting the Torch of Freedom award from Texans for Fiscal Responsibility by saying the House speaker, Joe Straus, separately told Gov. Rick Perry, who appointed Hall to the board, that he would drop the House\u2019s pressure on Hall if Hall just quit the board -- an offer that Straus spokesman Jason Embry subsequently said did not happen.", "Our attention was drawn by another part of Hall\u2019s speech.", "After saying his own questions about \"unusual admissions\" practices at UT led to a special House committee\u2019s impeachment proceedings, Hall added: \"And this quote from the speaker of the House before a large audience: \u2018I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.\u2019 This from the same speaker who claims his job is not to protect the citizens, but his (House) members.", "\"Of course, he did not attempt to confront me personally,\" Hall said. \"Does that seem odd to you?
