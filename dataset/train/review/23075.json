["About this rating", "A well-shared post on the Facebook page for The Christian Left shows a chart titled \u201cThe Best and Worst Countries for Democracy\u201d with a description indicating it demonstrates that the United States has fallen off the top 20 best countries:", "The chart was taken from the Economist magazine\u2019s annual Democracy Index report. Although no single body is in charge of officially ranking world democracies, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), \u201cthe research and analysis division of The Economist Group,\u201d has issued such a ranking in 2006, 2008, and every year since 2010. The group uses multiple factors to assign each country a single score, which is used to rank countries comparatively by their level of democracy as well as classify them in categories ranging from \u201cfull democracy\u201d to \u201cauthoritarian regime\u201d:", "The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. Based on their scores on 60 indicators within these categories, each country is then itself classified as one of four types of regime: full democracy; flawed democracy; hybrid regime; and authoritarian regime.", "The Facebook post was correct in noting that the United States had \u201cdropped off\u201d the ranking\u2019s top 20. The U.S. had fallen within the top 20 in a majority of these reports (peaking at number 17 in 2006 and 2010), but it dipped into the 21st spot in 2012 and again in the years 2016 and 2017.", "More significant than the comparative numerical ranking, however, is the category into which each country is placed. By the EIU\u2019s metrics, the U.S. had been considered a \u201cfull democracy\u201d every year until 2016 and 2017, when it was demoted to a \u201cflawed democracy\u201d:", "The US fell below the threshold for a \u201cfull democracy\u201d in 2016 and is now rated as a \u201cflawed democracy\u201d. The main cause of the US regression was a serious decline in public trust in US institutions in 2016. This year the country\u2019s overall score remained the same, and the US remains in 21st place in the global rankings.", "This \"Best and Worst Countries for Democracy\u201d chart is, of course, simply one media group's own assessment and should be regarded in that light.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2017\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2018.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2016\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2017.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2015\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2016.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2015\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2015.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2013\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2014.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2012\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2013.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2011\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2012.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2010\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2011.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"Democracy Index 2008\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2009.", "Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00a0 \"The World in 2007\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2008.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
