["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 2, 2021", "A viral video clip makes bogus claims about COVID-19 vaccines and falsely accuses the government of \u201cpure racism\u201d for \u201cpush[ing] this heavily on Blacks and browns.\u201d\u00a0Public health experts have recommended prioritizing those communities for the vaccine because they have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "The authorized or approved vaccines were initially tested in animals and early phase clinical trials, in which scientists evaluated different doses, checked for the expected immune responses and monitored for potential safety issues. To find out whether the shots prevent disease and are safe, the vaccines that passed the first set of tests were then evaluated in phase 3 trials.", "The Moderna and Novavax phase 3 trials each included about 30,000 volunteers, while the Pfizer/BioNTech\u00a0and Johnson & Johnson trials included about 44,000 each. In each of these trials, half of the participants received a placebo, while the other half received the vaccine, and the volunteers were followed over time to see if they fell ill with COVID-19 and had any adverse reactions.", "The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed not only by the Food and Drug Administration, which made the decision to authorize the vaccines for emergency use, but also by an outside panel of experts advising the agency. Another independent group, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also reviewed the data and recommended use of the vaccines.", "Following analysis of additional data from the phase 3 clinical trials, safety surveillance data and a review of the manufacturing process, including inspections of production facilities, the FDA granted full approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Aug. 23, 2021,\u00a0and the Moderna vaccine on Jan. 31, 2022.", "Pediatric versions of the mRNA vaccines were\u00a0authorized\u00a0based on\u00a0immune response data, which showed vaccinated kids had similar immune responses to vaccinated young adults, for whom\u00a0a clinical trial previously demonstrated efficacy.", "Booster doses of the original vaccines were also\u00a0authorized\u00a0primarily\u00a0based on data showing the additional shots increased levels of virus-specific antibodies.", "For omicron-updated vaccines, including the\u00a0bivalent doses\u00a0available in 2022-2023, and the\u00a0monovalent doses for the 2023-2024 season,\u00a0the FDA used an approach similar to how it approves flu vaccines each year, in which clinical studies are not required since the changes to the vaccine are minor.", "Link to this", "Dr. Simone Gold, who has a history of spreading dubious claims about the pandemic, used misinformation to sow doubt about COVID-19 vaccines in a live-streamed Jan. 3 address at a Pentecostal church in Florida.", "The video featuring Gold\u2019s roughly hourlong speech has been viewed tens of thousands of times on YouTube and Facebook. A shorter clip focused on claims about race was shared by a Facebook page that frequently posts about racial issues and describes itself as representing a nongovernmental advocacy organization. The page administrators are based in Ghana and the United Kingdom.", "We\u2019ll address the\u00a0claims made in that clip.", "One is a repeat of a vague claim we\u2019ve debunked before \u2014 the suggestion that the vaccines are unsafe. (For more on this, please see our SciCheck story \u201cViral Video Makes False and Unsupported Claims About Vaccines.\u201d)", "Gold\u2019s other false or misleading claims are aimed primarily at Black participation in the COVID-19 vaccination program. She misrepresents advice from public health experts who have advocated prioritizing vaccine distribution in the communities most severely impacted by the pandemic, which include Black, Latino and Native American people. (We\u2019ll get to the statistics next.) And she says that Black people are being used as unwitting test subjects, a suggestion that exploits distrust of the medical establishment in the Black community.", "Referring to the vaccine as an \u201cexperimental biological agent,\u201d Gold, who is white, says in the video: \u201cThey are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns.\u201d", "First of all, there are two available vaccines in the U.S. and both went through clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants before the Food and Drug Administration granted them each an emergency use authorization in December. The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed by the FDA and an outside panel of experts. So, calling either one an \u201cexperimental biological agent\u201d is misleading.", "In the video, Gold also tells her audience: \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t think this is ever going to be shown to be a race problem is things you just know by common sense. One is: It\u2019s been all over the world, all races, OK? We can just start with that. Second is: In areas of the world where people \u2026 have those individual risk factors, like diabetes or obesity and other illnesses, and the group risk factors, such as living and working in tight quarters, it\u2019s not Black people who get it at a worse rate, it\u2019s those people in those situations.\u201d", "Public health experts have called for prioritizing certain members of minority communities in the rollout of the vaccines because those communities have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic.", "Gold, however, misrepresents the reason for that recommendation, insinuating that experts say Black people are naturally more susceptible to COVID-19. But what they actually say is that social and historical factors have led to disparate health impacts on Black and some minority communities, which has led to elevated rates of illness and death from COVID-19.", "For instance, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that Black patients have the highest rates of both diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0obesity among racial groups, which, as Gold points out, increases the risk\u00a0of severe illness from COVID-19.", "\u201cIn the United States and worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the pervasive impacts of social and structural inequities in society,\u201d a paper from the National Academy of Sciences making recommendations on the equitable distribution of the vaccines said. \u201cCOVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on people who are already disadvantaged by virtue of their race and ethnicity, age, health status, residence, occupation, socioeconomic condition, and/or other contributing factors.\u201d", "According to data compiled at the end of 2020 by the CDC, Black Americans had a COVID-19 illness rate 1.4 times higher than their white counterparts and a death rate 2.8 times higher.", "Similarly, a project of American Public Media that tracks the impact of the virus by race found that in 2020, Indigenous, Black and Latino residents were at least 2.7 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than white residents.", "\u201cThe data on COVID-19 cases and deaths across many states in the U.S. have clearly shown that across all individuals getting the virus, Black and Brown people are disproportionately affected by and dying from this virus,\u201d Ren\u00e3 A.S. Robinson, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses, in part, on racial health disparities, told us in an email.", "\u201cBiologically, the virus is looking for a host (e.g., a human body) to attack,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., Black and Brown bodies have been disproportionately available for this virus to attack directly due to these communities having less access to equitable healthcare, high risk of exposure occupations, and increased burdens of chronic conditions \u2014 all directly related to historic systemic racism and ongoing discrimination and social injustices.\u201d", "The plan for distribution of the vaccines, including which populations should be prioritized, was largely left up to the states, though. So, the specific priorities of each state differed.", "The CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which issues guidance on vaccine distribution, noted that \u201csome racial and ethnic minority groups\u201d have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Those groups are heavily represented in \u201cessential\u201d jobs, which have elevated exposure to the virus, ACIP wrote in its Jan. 1 recommendation, explaining that those jobs include: \u201cfirst responders (e.g., firefighters and police officers), corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, U.S. Postal Service workers, manufacturing workers, grocery store workers, public transit workers, and those who work in the education sector (teachers and support staff members) as well as child care workers.\u201d", "ACIP did not recommend prioritizing the vaccine on the basis of race, but it did recommend prioritizing the vaccine for \u201cessential workers.\u201d", "In the video, Gold repeatedly cites a report that she describes as \u201cthe government\u2019s words,\u201d when she accuses the government of unfairly targeting Black people. But it\u2019s not a government document. It\u2019s a report from Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Health Security issued in August that sought to offer those tasked with making the distribution plan an ethical framework for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine.", "After noting that Black people and Native Americans were hospitalized for COVID-19 at a rate five times higher than white people, the report said, \u201cAs a matter of justice, these disparities in COVID-19 risk and adverse outcomes across racial and ethnic groups should be addressed in our overall COVID-19 response.\u201d But, again, that was advice offered more than three months before the first vaccine was authorized for use. It wasn\u2019t binding and it didn\u2019t come from the government.", "Since the vaccines have become available, 16 states have publicly reported data on their usage by race and ethnicity, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. That data showed that \u201cthe share of vaccinations among Black people is smaller than their share of cases in all 16 reporting states and smaller than their share of deaths in 15 states,\u201d according to KFF.", "Later, Gold insinuates that Black people are being used as unsuspecting test subjects. \u201cIf you take the vaccine, you\u2019re signing up to be in a pharmacovigilance tracking system,\u201d she says.", "It\u2019s worth noting that a popular conspiracy theory had claimed the vaccines would include some kind of tracking device. They don\u2019t.", "Gold says that the government\u2019s plan for distribution was \u201ctargeting the Black community,\u201d which she calls \u201cpure racism.\u201d She goes on to say,\u00a0\u201cIt means you\u2019ve enrolled yourself in a medical trial. \u2026 Most people are not aware that that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. This pharmacovigilance tracking system tracks you for two years. It\u2019s set up by the Department of Defense. It was handed off to Oracle and Google to put the data together.\u201d", "Gold\u2019s claims speak to entrenched fears and distrust in Black communities of medical institutions caused by experiments such as the Tuskegee study. Gold actually references this experiment in her speech, but fails to explain the difference between what happened then and what is happening now.", "In 1932, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the U.S. government lied to Black men, telling them they were going to receive treatment for \u201cbad blood,\u201d while they were actually being studied for the effects of untreated syphilis.", "Now, there are two tested and authorized vaccines available to the general public during a global pandemic.", "Susan Rice, who is in charge of White House domestic policy for President Joe Biden, addressed the issue when she was asked at a press briefing about how to overcome vaccine hesitancy in Black communities.", "She noted\u00a0that Biden\u2019s newly established COVID-19 task force is addressing health equity and said, \u201cthere are Americans, and particularly Americans of color, who for very valid historical reasons are skeptical and reluctant.\u201d", "Rice said that the task force \u201cis reaching out directly through targeted campaigns to get to those very communities where the skepticism is highest. And that\u2019s vitally important because as communities of color are suffering disproportionately, may have less access to information about the vaccine, and the ability to easily go online, in some instances, and get an appointment. We have to take those additional steps to ensure that they are aware of its availability, they can get appointments and that they understand that the vaccine is safe.\u201d", "It is also false that, as Gold claimed, by taking the vaccine \u201cyou\u2019ve enrolled yourself in a medical trial.\u201d Taking the vaccine after it\u2019s been tested and authorized does not enroll a patient in a trial.", "The \u201ctracking system\u201d that Gold appears to reference is actually an online management system for vaccine distribution and monitoring. One element is v-safe, an online portal to report side effects to the CDC. As we\u2019ve explained before, trial data from the two currently available vaccines show that many people experience pain at the site of injection, fatigue, joint or muscle pain, headache, chills or fever \u2014 which, according to the CDC, \u201care normal signs that your body is building protection.\u201d Use of that portal is optional, not mandatory, Oracle spokeswoman Kris Reeves confirmed to us by email.", "CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund also confirmed to us by email that participation is voluntary.", "Another element of the system acts as a \u201cnational clearing house\u201d for the CDC\u2019s anonymized vaccination data, which means that the information doesn\u2019t include patients\u2019 identifying information. That data \u201cwill be used for analysis and reporting by authorized agencies and organizations,\u201d Oracle wrote in a press release explaining the system.", "Nothing in Oracle\u2019s description of the system indicates that it would track individual patients.", "As we said at the start, Gold has a history of spreading dubious claims about COVID-19. She started an organization called America\u2019s Frontline Doctors in the summer of 2020, although some of the most visible members of the group didn\u2019t actually practice medicine on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Gold is a\u00a0licensed doctor\u00a0in California, although it\u2019s unclear how much she practiced during the pandemic. Gold told us that she worked at two hospitals in 2020, one of which is about 500 miles away from her home in Los Angeles. She also received $154,633 in loans\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Paycheck Protection Program, part of the coronavirus relief\u00a0package that passed in March 2020,\u00a0according to a watchdog group tracking those loans, for businesses located at the address of her concierge medical business.", "Also, the church where Gold spoke is run by Rodney Howard-Browne, a pastor who has advanced COVID-19 conspiracy theories and was arrested in March 2020 for holding services in violation of public health laws aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.", "In addition to conspiracy theories, Howard-Browne mixes politics into his religious messaging. He asserted, for example, that President Donald Trump should have remained in power despite having been voted out of office.", "And, three days after she spoke at the church, Gold was filmed in the U.S. Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall after a mob had overtaken the building in an effort to overturn the election results and keep Trump in power. Gold was arrested on Jan. 18 and charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
