["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit.\n\nGingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: \"The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks.\"\n\nBy \"Obamacare,\" a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?\n\nBy way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients.\n\nWe asked Gingrich\u2019s campaign for the former House speaker\u2019s basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: \"All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. \u00a0Sorry.\"\n\nBut DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBM\u2019s then-CEO and chairman.\n\nSeparately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.\n\nThe video opens with the Journal\u2019s Alan Murray saying: \"When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.\"\n\nPalmisano: \"Yes, I did.\"\n\nMurray: \"What was that all about?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Palmisano replied, \"part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. That\u2019s what we all were working on at the time.\"\n\nAsked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: \"We haven\u2019t made any progress. It doesn\u2019t mean there hasn\u2019t been a lot of interaction.\"\n\nMurray: \"Well, what\u2019s the point of interaction if it doesn\u2019t lead to progress?\"\n\nPalmisano: \"You\u2019d have to ask the people who aren\u2019t progressing.\"\n\nHe added, \"We\u2019ve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we haven\u2019t been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.\"\n\nPalmisano offered an example: \"We -- and I\u2019m fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.\"\n\nAbout $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. \"Buy a nationwide discount,\" he said. \"Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. It\u2019s no different. I said, \u2018Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount.\u2019 \"\n\nAnother example of savings: \"Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasn\u2019t transformational. ... There\u2019s so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. It\u2019s 200 billion.\"\n\nMurray: \"And why didn\u2019t they do that? Is there a fraud --\"\n\nPalmisano: \"I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. You\u2019ll have to ask them\u2026 Free. Free wasn\u2019t good enough.\"\n\nMurray asks again: Why?\n\nPalmisano replies, \"I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. \u00a0It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. \u00a0That was our priority in the line. \u00a0All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. \u00a0And we couldn't sell the case.\"\n\nLet\u2019s take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.\n\nWe were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEO\u2019s comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisano\u2019s claims.\n\nThat program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.\n\nAmong the plan\u2019s seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect \"improper payments\" -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the government\u2019s $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.\n\nBy email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisano\u2019s claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on \"possible projects\" but agreed not to \"move forward,\" although IBM is a partner in \"our work to fight fraud.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisano\u2019s claims. Contrary to Gingrich\u2019s debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul. We rate Gingrich\u2019s statement Half True.", "C-SPAN video, \"Herman Cain-Newt Gingrich Lincoln-Douglas Style Debate,\" Nov. 5, 2011\n\nMSNBC.com news story, \"Obama: $900 billion to fix health care,\" by M.
