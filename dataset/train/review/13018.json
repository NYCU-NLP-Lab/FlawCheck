(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "Waters was one of the earliest elected officials supporting impeachment of Trump, calling for it just a few months after he took office in January 2017. While she didn\u2019t make this exact comment, it appears she did say something similar, but it was in the context of impeachment, not violence.
