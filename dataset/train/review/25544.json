Feinberg has been criticized by politicians at the state and national level for months for what some politicians have called a much too slow response.\n\nSink spokesman Kevin Cate pointed us to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility's own analysis as evidence of the slow claims process.\n\nCate used the latest statistics available for Dec. 7.", "We should note that as of Dec. 7, Feinberg has awarded more than $900 million to Floridians and Florida business owners. Almost all of the money paid out is compensation for lost earnings or profits. You can read the latest report for yourself here.\n\nIn lashing out against BP claims administrator Feinberg, Sink noted that of all claims made in Florida following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, only 40 percent had been paid. She's just about right on. So far, about 43 percent of claims submitted by Floridians or Florida business owners have been paid, another 39 percent have been denied and a little more than 18 percent are still under some type of review. We rate Sink's claim True.", "Palm Beach Post, \"Sink takes swipe at BP claims czar in last Cabinet meeting for her, Crist, Bronson, McCollum,\" Dec. 7, 2010\n\nFlorida Cabinet, audio recording of Dec. 7, 2010 meeting\n\nE-mail interview with Sink spokesman Kevin Cate, Dec. 8, 2010\n\nGulf Coast Claims Facility\n\nGulf Coast Claims Facility, report on Florida claims, Dec. 7, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
