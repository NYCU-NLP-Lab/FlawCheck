The 107th Congress met from 3 January 2001 until 2 January 2003, during which time the September 11th attacks occurred in 2001.

Section G of Subtitle E defined the term \"unaccompanied alien child\" as a minor under the age of 18, lacking lawful immigration status in the US, and primarily, an individual for whom \"there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States\" or \"no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.\" This did not mandate that children be separated from their families, but instead, created a legal classification for children with no parent or guardian present or for whom no parent or legal guardian was available to provide care and custody.", "Debate surrounding Public Law 107-296 was ill-defined, with many simply sharing the screenshot as a vague indication the policy of family separation came before the debate about it in May and June 2018. Many attributed its passage to Democrat lawmakers. However, the bill was passed in November 2002 under a Republican majority, and it simply defined an \"unaccompanied alien child\" as one with no available parent or guardian.
