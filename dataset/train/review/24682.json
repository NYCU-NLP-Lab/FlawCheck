["CNN anchor Don Lemon offered a commentary on race that went viral. We fact-checked a claim he made about out-of-wedlock births among African-Americans.", "In the middle of a national conversation about race following the George Zimmerman acquittal, CNN anchor Don Lemon gave an on-air commentary that went viral on social media. The focus of the commentary was a five-point list of recommendations. \"Black people,\" Lemon said, \"if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing.\"", "The No. 1 item on that list -- \"and probably the most important,\" he said -- had to do with out-of-wedlock births.", "\"Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should,\" Lemon said. \"Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.\"", "Lemon\u2019s commentary inspired a firestorm of criticism on social media -- the website Mediaite published a sampling -- and bloggers took aim at his conclusions.", "\"If Lemon really wanted to help the black community, he could start by adopting a deeper understanding of the history, sociology and psychology of his own people,\" wrote Washington Post blogger Rahiel Tesfamariam. \"Offering made-for-TV analysis about deeply complex social issues in the manner in which he did is irresponsible and lacks intellectual rigor.\"", "We can\u2019t check Lemon\u2019s opinions, but we did want to take a look at the one verifiable fact he offered. Is it correct that \"more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock\"?", "We turned to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes a report every year that includes a wealth of data about births in America. The most recent report, published in August 2012, is based on data from 2010.", "The report broke down statistics by ethnic groups. Here\u2019s a summary", "Racial or ethnic group", "Percent of births considered \"non-marital\"", "Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders", "17 percent", "Non-Hispanic whites", "29 percent", "Hispanics", "53 percent", "American Indian and Native Alaskans", "66 percent", "Non-Hispanic blacks", "73 percent", "So Lemon is correct that \"more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock.\" To make sure we weren\u2019t missing something, we asked two population experts -- Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, and Douglas Massey, professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research -- and they agreed that the statistic is the best available.", "Lemon did overreach somewhat when he went on to say that the 72 percent \"out of wedlock\" figure \"means absent fathers.\" The 72 percent figure refers to children who are born to women who are not married; it would, however, include unmarried couples in which the father is present.", "That said, the rate of African-American children living in single-parent homes is almost as high as the rate for non-marital births.", "The chart below summarizes 2011 Census Bureau data compiled by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The group defined \"children in single-parent families\" as kids under 18 who live with their own single parent; it includes children living with a parent and a cohabiting adult, but it does not include children living with married step-parents.", "Racial or ethnic group", "Children in single-parent families", "Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders", "17 percent", "Non-Hispanic whites", "25 percent", "Hispanics", "42 percent", "American Indian and Native Alaskans", "53 percent", "Non-Hispanic blacks", "67 percent", "We should note that this data doesn\u2019t suggest that 67 percent of African-American children have no contact with their father (or a father figure), but rather that their father does not live in the same household with them.", "Our ruling", "Lemon said that \"more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock.\" Federal data confirms that 73 percent of African-American births in 2010 were out of wedlock. Estimates for the percentage of African-American children growing up in single-parent households are slightly lower, at 67 percent. Finally, black children counted in these statistics may have contact outside the household with their biological father. But Lemon's statistic was accurate, and we rate his statement True.", "Don Lemon, comments on CNN, July 27, 2013", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Births: Final Data for 2010,\" August 28, 2012", "Kids Count, \"Children in single-parent families by race,\" accessed July 29, 2013", "PolitiFact, \"Rick Santorum says over 40 percent of children are born out of wedlock,\" Feb. 24, 2012", "Mediaite, \"Tweetnado: MSNBC\u2019s Goldie Taylor Calls Don Lemon A \u2018Turn Coat Mofo,\u2019\" July 27, 2013", "Washington Post, \"Don Lemon\u2019s bootstrap lecture disguised as \u2018tough love,'\" July 29, 2013", "Email interview with Tom W.
