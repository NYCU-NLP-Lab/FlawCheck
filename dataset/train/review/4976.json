["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on August 28, 2018", "Q: Did John McCain \u201chide the fact that he \u2018accidentally\u2019 killed 134 American sailors\u201d?", "A:\u00a0No. He wasn\u2019t responsible for the fatal 1967 accident aboard the USS Forrestal.", "John McCain \u2014\u00a0Did his plane fire missile and kill U.S.\u00a0soldiers aboard ship?", "In the days following the death of Sen. John McCain on Aug. 25, numerous readers have inquired about a claim that the Arizona Republican was responsible for the deaths of more than 100 sailors aboard the USS Forrestal. He wasn\u2019t.", "The recycled falsehood distorts the facts about that July 1967 disaster off the coast of Vietnam, which we wrote about in 2008 when McCain sought the presidency. There is no evidence McCain was responsible for the accident, which claimed 134 lives, injured another 161 and almost killed McCain.", "A website known for promulgating fictitious stories repeated the claim nonetheless \u2014 falsely citing a decade-old Washington Post fact-checking report as evidence.", "\u201cJohn McCain fudged his navy record and desperately tried to hide the fact that he \u2018accidentally\u2019 killed 134 American sailors, according to the Washington Post,\u201d begins the Aug. 27 story on Your News Wire. The piece was published two days after McCain\u2019s\u00a0death, and\u00a0the same or similar deceptions were posted on other websites.", "In reality, the 2008\u00a0Washington Post story\u00a0never said McCain was responsible for the accident. The most critical part of the piece actually centered on a nonfatal 1960 plane crash from when McCain was in flight school in\u00a0Corpus Christi, Texas.", "The Post story\u00a0challenged a statement made in McCain\u2019s autobiography that the 1960 crash was due to engine failure. An official Navy report that was obtained by the Los Angeles Times found that wasn\u2019t the case.", "Los Angeles Times, Oct. 6, 2008: Investigators determined that McCain was watching instruments in his cockpit that indicated the position of his landing gear and had lost track of his altitude and speed.", "The Navy report concluded: \u201cIn the opinion of the board, the pilot\u2019s preoccupation in the cockpit . . . coupled with the use of a power setting too low to maintain level flight in a turn were the primary causes of this accident.\u201d", "Years later, in July 1967, McCain was aboard the carrier USS Forrestal when a missile that was fired accidentally\u00a0from an aircraft\u00a0hit another plane, sparking the deadly fire and explosions.", "It wasn\u2019t clear whose plane the missile struck. McCain said the missile hit his plane, but records indicated that it likely struck the plane that was next to his. Still, there is no credible assertion that McCain, then a lieutenant commander, was to blame for that accident.", "As we wrote in 2008, the official Navy investigation into the disaster showed the rocket actually misfired from the other side of the flight deck.\u00a0James M. Caiella, a writer and editor who researched the event and obtained records from the Navy, told us then that \u201cthere is no possible way John McCain could have caused the fire on board the Forrestal.\u201d", "The Post story made that point as well. After mentioning the 1967 disaster \u2014 and the episode months later in which his plane was shot down and he was captured by the North Vietnamese \u2014 the article notes that \u201cU.S. Navy records make clear that no blame can be attached to McCain for either of these incidents.\u201d", "The Navy awarded\u00a0McCain the Silver Star for his \u201cconspicuous gallantry\u201d while he was imprisoned for nearly five-and-a-half years. He also received the\u00a0Distinguished Flying Cross,\u00a0three Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts and the Prisoner-of-War medal.", "Update, Aug. 29: After we published this article, Your News Wire updated its headline and story to remove the false claim that McCain was responsible for the deaths in the 1967 USS Forrestal disaster. \u201cThere is no evidence for this,\u201d the website said in its correction.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "Dobbs, Michael. \u201cMcCain fudges his Navy record.\u201d Washington Post. 6 Oct 2008.", "Jackson, Brooks. \u201cMcCain\u2019s Plane Crashes.\u201d FactCheck.org. 5 Sept 2008.", "\u201cThe Catastrophic Fire On Board USS Forrestal (CVA-59).\u201d The Naval History and Heritage Command. 5 Dec 2017.", "Vartabedian, Ralph, and Richard A.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
