["By Robert Farley", "Posted on September 7, 2017", "In advocating for a corporate tax cut, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin overstates the consensus when he says \u201cmost economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers.\u201d", "In fact, who bears the brunt of corporate taxes \u2014 investors or labor \u2014\u00a0 is a matter of vigorous debate among economists who have studied it.", "Three nonpartisan organizations \u2014 the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office and Tax Policy Center \u2014 all say the majority of the corporate tax burden falls on shareholders, not workers. The Treasury Department, which Mnuchin now heads, reached that same conclusion in 2008 during the George W. Bush administration.", "To be sure, there are many economists who do share Mnuchin\u2019s view. But to describe them as \u201cmost economists\u201d is an exaggeration.", "President Donald Trump has promised to overhaul the nation\u2019s tax laws \u2014 including slashing the corporate tax rate.\u00a0Details of his tax proposal have been sparse, but a\u00a0 one-page summary released in April called for reducing the statutory corporate tax rate to 15 percent from current rate of 35 percent. The U.S. has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries, but the effective corporate tax rate is about average when tax credits are factored in.", "The question about who shoulders the bulk of the burden of corporate taxes is likely to shape up as a key issue in the congressional tax debate. Trump has repeatedly insisted his tax plan would focus cuts on the \u201cmiddle class\u201d and cutting corporate taxes is a key component of his vow to increase median family income.", "On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d host Chris Wallace asked Mnuchin about independent reports that have concluded shareholders carry the overwhelming majority of the burden of corporate taxes, and would therefore get most of the benefit from corporate tax cuts.", "Wallace, Sept. 3: Independent experts, including your own Treasury Department, say that shareholders, people who own stock get \u2014 they are 75 percent to 85 percent of the burden from higher corporate tax rates and that if those corporate tax rates are lowered, that they will get 75 percent to 85 percent of the benefit, not the workers.", "Mnuchin: Chris, most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers. And the fact that the Treasury Department, I think it was eight or 10 years ago, put out a piece otherwise. I don\u2019t believe in that. Our current economic team does not believe in that. There is lots of economic research.", "Most economists now agree that workers carry at least some of the load of corporate taxes, and that to the extent lower corporate taxes might boost investment, workers would derive some benefit from those corporate tax cuts. But economists disagree strongly about the extent to which labor would benefit.", "In 2008, the Office of Tax Analysis at the Treasury Department revisited its assumption that the corporate income tax was entirely borne by capital income. Using a new methodology, the OTA determined 76 percent of the corporate tax burden was borne by \u201cnormal or supernormal capital income\u201d and 24 percent by labor. In 2012, the Treasury Department issued a \u201ctechnical paper\u201d explaining the use of a new and improved distributional model that reached a similar conclusion (adjusting the share borne by capital income to 82 percent).", "Until 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) similarly assumed the entire burden of corporate taxes (or the benefits of corporate tax cuts) fell on the owners of capital. But in 2012, the CBO reevaluated the research on the topic and decided to allocate \u201c75 percent of the federal corporate income tax to capital income and 25 percent to labor income.\u201d (See Page 13.)", "The following year, in response to \u201ccurrent economic research on the distribution of corporate income taxes,\u201d the Joint Committee on Taxation performed its own analysis and concluded, \u201c75 percent of corporate income taxes and 95 percent of the taxes attributable to pass-through business income [distributes] to owners of capital.\u201d The committee reserved the right to update that conclusion, however, given that \u201csome uncertainty remains regarding the division of the incidence between owners of domestic capital and labor.\u201d", "Independent non-governmental groups have similarly concluded that corporate taxes mostly affect shareholders. In 2012, the Tax Policy Center weighed in with its report, \u201cHow TPC Distributes the Corporate Income Tax.\u201d", "While it had previously assigned the entire corporate income tax burden \u201cto being borne by the total returns to all capital,\u201d the Tax Policy Center acknowledged \u201crecent economic research\u201d that \u201chas improved our understanding of who bears the burden of the corporate income tax.\u201d", "\u201cMy paper cites the economic research in support of assigning most of the corporate income tax burden to shareholders and others who receive income from investment (such as interest),\u201d James Nunns, author of the TPC paper, told us via email. \u201cThe Tax Policy Center assigns 80 percent of the corporate income tax burden to capital and only 20 percent to labor (workers\u2019 wages and fringe benefits).\u201d", "Nonetheless, there are economists who have concluded\u2014 as Mnuchin has \u2014 that workers bear the brunt of corporate taxes, and would reap most of the rewards of a corporate tax cut.", "The Treasury Department press office pointed us toward three economic analyses:", "A Congressional Research Service report issued in December 2012, and written by Jane G. Gravelle and Thomas L. Hungerford, concluded that \u201cnew arguments\u201d about most of the burden of the corporate tax falling on labor \u2014 such as those cited above\u00a0 \u2014 \u201crely on questionable methods\u201d and \u201care not supported by empirical data.\u201d", "In a subsequent report published in 2014, the CRS states that while \u201ca number of more recent theoretical studies find that labor can bear the majority of the [corporate] tax burden\u201d those studies \u201cappear to rely critically on particular assumptions that drive the results. When these assumptions are relaxed the burden of the corporate tax is found to fall mostly on capital \u2014 in line with the traditional analysis.\u201d", "CRS, Dec. 1, 2014: Given the unreliability of recent empirical research, and the consistency of traditional theoretical models, some economists have been reluctant to move away from traditional incidence assumptions, where owners of capital are assumed to bear most of the burden of the corporate tax.", "Kimberly Clausing\u00a0\u2014 an economics professor at Reed College and author of the paper \u201cWho Pays the Corporate Tax in a Global Economy?\u201d \u2014 dismissed research suggesting most of the corporate tax burden is tied to labor as mostly theoretical, unable to be replicated, \u201cflawed\u201d and \u201cimplausible.\u201d", "\u201cResearch shows that corporate tax cuts are far more likely to end up in the hands of those at the top of the income distribution,\u201d Clausing told us in an email.", "\u201cIf burgeoning corporate after-tax profits were the key to investment and wage growth, then the previous 15 years should have been a paradise of wage growth, as after-tax profits in recent years have been about 50 percent higher than in decades prior (as a share of GDP), and higher than at any point in the past half-century,\u201d Clausing said. \u201c\u2026 [T]he rates that have been suggested \u2014 rates as low as 15 percent or 20 percent \u2014 would not deliver substantial economic benefits for the middle class and would instead result in huge revenue losses and a much lighter tax burden for those at the top of the income distribution.\u201d", "Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley, told us that while \u201csome or even many economists\u201d agree with Mnuchin\u2019s view that the bulk of the corporate tax burden falls on workers, \u201cit\u2019s not accurate to say that most believe this.\u201d", "Auerbach, Sept. 5: This is a question on which there are considerable differences among economists who have studied the question. The CBO moved a few years ago from assuming that all corporate taxes fall on owners of capital to assuming that 25 percent falls on workers, and that does reflect a shift in the evidence toward some of the burden falling on labor, in part because of the increasing importance of globalization. There are some studies suggesting that labor bears as much as all of the burden. It would certainly be fair to say that some or even many economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes fall on workers. But it\u2019s not accurate to say that most believe this.", "We have learned here at FactCheck.org that it is rarely possible to definitively settle arguments between competing economists. But we can say Mnuchin stretches the facts when he says \u201cmost economists\u201d share his view.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
