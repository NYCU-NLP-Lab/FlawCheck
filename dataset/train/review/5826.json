Trump was transported to Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland,\u00a0later that day as a precaution, USA TODAY reported.", "Social media has been inundated with conspiracy theories. Some accused\u00a0the president of lying about his illness while others blamed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's camp for the president's exposure to the virus. Trump and Biden met on the debate stage in Cleveland on Tuesday, Sept. 29.", "A claim posted to Facebook on Oct. 3 \u00a0features a screenshot of an Oct. 2 tweet by former congressional candidate Deanna Lorraine.

Incubation period is usually 2-3 days. He tests positive a couple of days after the debate. I put nothing past the left. NOTHING.\"", "Lorraine ended\u00a0the tweet with \"#TrumpHasCOVID.\"", "The Facebook user shared Lorraine's skepticism, captioning the post \"Anyone else think it\u2019s pretty coincidental?\"", "USA TODAY reached out to the user for comment.", "Fact check:Claim that Trump's positive COVID-19 test result is a 'con' has no basis in fact", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0states the time between exposure and the development of symptoms \u2013 or the\u00a0incubation period \u2013 for SARS CoV-2 and other coronaviruses is 2-14 days based on existing literature.", "Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for\u00a0COVID-19 in the early hours of Oct. 2, approximately three days after the Sept. 29 presidential debate.", "But comments from a doctor treating the president at Walter Reed led to more questions than answers about when the president may have contracted COVID-19.", "The president's physician, Dr. Sean Conley, told reporters\u00a0Saturday that Trump was 72 hours into his diagnosis, indicating he may have been diagnosed as early as Wednesday, according to USA TODAY. Trump traveled to Minnesota and New Jersey in the days leading up to the\u00a0announcement from The White House.", "More:Trump reports feeling better, but here's why the next few days are 'the real test' in his COVID-19 battle", "Conley later released an official statement to clarify the timeline, saying \"I incorrectly used the term 'seventy two hours' instead of 'day two' with regards to (President Trump's) diagnosis and the administration of the polyclonal antibody therapy.

In a later interview with Fox News' Bill Hemmer, Wallace said members of Biden's and Trump's camps arrived too late to get\u00a0tested.", "\"I arrived on Sunday, I think you arrived on Monday,\" Wallace told Hemmer. \"They didn't arrive 'til Tuesday afternoon. So for them to get tested, there wouldn't have been enough time to have the test and have the debate that night. They didn't show up until 3:00, 4:00, 5:00 that afternoon. So yeah, there was an honor system when it came to the people who came into the hall from the two campaigns.\"", "A clip of the interview was posted to the Twitter account for MeidasTouch.com, a progressive Super PAC. News outlets The Hill and CNBC also reported on Wallace's comments.", "Trump's family also declined to wear masks throughout the debate, as mandated by\u00a0the event's organizers.

The claim that \"the left\" exposed Trump to the coronavirus during the Sept. 29 presidential debate is little more than a conspiracy theory without any basis in fact. The claim presents an implausible conclusion in light of what is known about Trump's travels and potential exposure in the days and weeks prior to his diagnosis. Measures were taken during the debate\u00a0to ensure the safety of all attendees, but while most in the audience wore masks as instructed, Trump's family\u00a0did not. It is also possible the president was exposed to COVID-19 prior to the debate. He attended a Sept. 26 event at\u00a0the White House Rose Garden with several others who have\u00a0tested positive for the coronavirus in recent days.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
