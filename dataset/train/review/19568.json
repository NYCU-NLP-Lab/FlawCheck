["Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says the electorate should pick a candidate based on more than his or her resume.", "At the first prime-time debate for the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Rubio said he\u2019s qualified even though he doesn\u2019t have executive experience.", "\"This election cannot be a resume competition,\" he said. \"It\u2019s important to be qualified, but if this election is going to be a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's going to be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.\"", "Does Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton really have a longer government resume than all 17 candidates on the GOP side?", "If you only count Clinton\u2019s years as a U.S. senator (2001-08) and and a secretary of state (2009-13), then Clinton has 12 years in office, and that\u2019s easily outpaced by many of the GOP candidates.", "Rubio is likely counting her time as first lady of the United States, from 1993-2000, when she had a more formal role with her own administrative office and a voice in national policy discussions. While counting her First Lady years is debatable -- it\u2019s not an elected or appointed office -- counting it would bring her total to about 20 years.", "If you counted her time as first lady of Arkansas from 1979-80 and 1983-92, that would bring the total to 31 years. (Clinton had a private position as a lawyer for the Rose Law Firm during much of this time, so it\u2019s not equivalent to the responsibilities of first lady of the United States.)", "We think it\u2019s a stretch to count the Arkansas years, so we would put Clinton\u2019s experience at about 20 years. As we\u2019ll see, there are several Republicans who have 20 years or more in public office.", "Among Republicans, there are three candidates who have no government experience: real estate mogul Donald Trump, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and neurosurgeon Ben Carson.", "Then there are the candidates who do not have at least 12 years in public office (the number of years Clinton has, minus her years as first lady): former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.", "That leaves the candidates who have at least 12 years of experience:", "Former Arkansas Gov.
