But VAERS -- the source cited in the posts -- makes clear that reports of incidents are not confirmation that they resulted from a vaccine.", "As countries around the world seek to immunize their populations against Covid-19, inaccurate claims about the vaccines are spreading across the internet, despite efforts by social media companies to stop them and assurances from health authorities that the shots are safe and effective.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked numerous claims about Covid-19 vaccines, including that they can cause female sterilization or contain a dangerous ingredient, that leading politicians faked receiving shots, and that baseball star Hank Aaron\u2019s death was linked to his immunization.", "According to the Mayo Clinic, miscarriage \u201cis a relatively common experience\u201d and occurs in about 10-20 percent of known pregnancies, often when the fetus is not developing normally.", "While reports of miscarriages following Covid-19 immunization have been submitted to VAERS, a description of the program\u2019s database\u00a0says it \u201ccontains information on unverified reports of adverse events (illnesses, health problems and/or symptoms) following immunization with US-licensed vaccines.\u201d", "The VAERS website also says these \u201creports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- which runs the VAERS program in concert with the Food and Drug Administration -- if it had identified any trends of miscarriages following Covid-19 immunization.", "\u201cTo date, no evidence has indicated an increase in miscarriages after Covid-19 vaccines, and no concerning patterns of reporting have been observed,\u201d a spokesperson responded by email.", "And Dr\u00a0Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, said by email that: \u201cThere is no association between vaccination and any aspect of reproduction.\u201d", "A page on the CDC\u2019s website cautions that there is limited data about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines for pregnant women because its impact on them has not been studied.", "But it also notes that the disease poses a heightened risk of severe illness to pregnant women, and says: \u201cBased on how mRNA vaccines work, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant.\u201d", "The full list of AFP\u2019s fact checks in English on false or misleading claims about Covid-19 can be found here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
