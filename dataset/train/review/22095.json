["The claim\u00a0was posted here\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook by an Australia-based user on July 26, 2020. It has been shared more than 170 times.", "A purported screenshot included in the Facebook post claims a 19-year-old woman contracted pleurisy after wearing a face mask for eight hours a day, five or six days a week. \u201cThey basically tell her\u2026 it's because she has been wearing a mask for over 8 hours a day 5-6 days a week. Breathing in her own bacteria. Carbon dioxide\u2026 Caused an infection.\u201d", "The post\u00a0circulated as governments worldwide continue to recommend or mandate the wearing of face masks in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19. Authorities in the Australian city of\u00a0Melbourne, for example, made wearing masks in public compulsory on July 23, 2020, AFP reported here.", "The move towards mask wearing came after the World Health Organization (WHO) on June 6, 2020, changed its advice and advocated for face masks for their ability to \u201cprotect people wearing the mask from getting infected, as well as can prevent those who have symptoms from spreading them.\u201d The advice coincided with the emergence of conspiracy theories that allege wearing masks will negatively affect people's health, as reported by Australian and international media here and here.", "Similar claims about face masks were\u00a0shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here, here, here and here. It also circulated here on Facebook in Dutch.", "The\u00a0claims, however, are false, health experts say.", "Pleurisy claim", "The Department of Health in the Australian state of Victoria\u00a0does not list face masks as a cause of pleurisy. The condition, the agency\u00a0says, is caused by viral infection, bacterial infection, cancer, blood clot in the lungs and autoimmune conditions.", "Dr. Leon van den Toorn, president of the Dutch Association of Doctors for Lung Diseases and Tuberculosis and a pulmonologist at the Erasmus University Medical Centre, dismissed the claim as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d.", "\u201cThere is simply no indication that a face mask carries any health risk whatsoever,\u201d van den Toorn said.", "Infection claim", "Dr. Hans in \u2018t Veen, a pulmonologist at Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, told AFP: \u201cA face mask used normally will not give you an infection in the lungs. Perhaps in the case of a fungus it\u2019s possible, but it would have to be a face mask that hasn\u2019t been changed for months and is extremely dirty.\u201d", "AFP previously debunked here a false claim that blames face masks for fungal lung infections.", "Carbon dioxide claim", "Van den Toorn rejected claims that mask wearers would be deprived of adequate oxygen or that they would be breathing in an excessive amount of carbon dioxide, adding that humans breathe in their own bacteria irrespective of whether they are wearing a face mask, \u201cbecause they are in your mouth.\u201d", "\u201cInhaling and exhaling air happens in more or less the same way as [without a face mask]. Air passes around and through the face mask so there\u2019s no question about it causing a lack of oxygen,\u201d he says.", "Dr. Shelley Payne, the interim director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at University of Texas at Austin, echoed that: \u201cA properly fitted mask will not cause hypoxia.\u201d", "AFP debunked a separate claim about face masks causing hypoxia, a condition in which the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, here. Other false claims that allege face masks can cause a surge in carbon dioxide level have also been addressed by AFP here and here.", "AFP has also debunked a false claim\u00a0that wearing masks can compromise a person's immune system.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
