["By Angelo Fichera and Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 2, 2020", "The news that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump contracted the novel coronavirus led to a wave of social media posts spreading misinformation \u2014 and politically charged speculation.", "Some of posts tapped into baseless conspiracy theories, and others shared outright falsehoods, as we\u2019ll explain.", "First, here\u2019s some of what we know about the matter:", "In the hours immediately following Trump\u2019s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Others shared conspiracy theories.", "Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that \u201cthe left\u201d may have deliberately spread the virus to him.", "Neither notion is supported by available evidence.", "One popular Facebook post cast doubt on the diagnosis by saying that Trump \u201cneeded a \u2018reset'\u201d for his campaign and therefore the diagnosis may be a \u201ccon.\u201d", "Another widely shared post raised the suspicion that the diagnosis may be a bid at \u201cfree publicity\u201d and a move to get out of the next debate with his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.", "Asked on Fox News what would happen in terms of the Oct. 15 presidential debate \u2014 which falls within the 14-day quarantine window \u2014\u00a0White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten that far just yet.\u201d", "On Twitter, DeAnna Lorraine \u2014 a far-right candidate who has\u00a0promoted\u00a0the QAnon conspiracy theory and launched a\u00a0failed\u00a0bid for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s seat \u2014 speculated on Twitter that Trump may have been intentionally infected during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.", "Lorraine offered no evidence to support her speculation in her\u00a0original tweet, which said: \u201cTrump was fine until the debate, where they set up microphones & podiums for him. Incubation period is usually 2-3 days. He tests positive a couple of days after the debate. I put nothing past the left. NOTHING.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to our request for information.", "But the tweet was shared more than 6,000 times within hours of being posted. Lorraine herself later responded to another Twitter user,\u00a0saying, \u201cImpossible to prove, but something that needs to be in the discussion.\u201d", "According to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 spreads mostly through respiratory droplets \u2014 created when people sneeze, cough or talk. That\u2019s why public health officials recommend wearing masks.", "\u201cIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cThis is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads.\u201d", "During the debate, though, not everyone in the room was wearing a mask. Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor who moderated the event, reported on Oct. 2 that the Trump family didn\u2019t wear masks in the debate hall, while Biden\u2019s supporters did. \u201cThere was a difference in the way the two families and their camps treated the health-safety regulations inside the hall,\u201d Wallace said.", "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones added to the unfounded claims online, suggesting that the test result may be part of a \u201ccoup.\u201d In a\u00a0video address\u00a0Oct. 2, Jones said that the result may have been a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d which would allow an adversary in the White House to poison the president\u2019s soda and later say that he suffered from COVID-19.", "Jones gave no evidence to support this theory. There is no evidence suggesting that the president\u2019s illness is part of a coup.", "But other purveyors of dubious claims echoed the fear of a coup, including a right-wing commentator who goes by\u00a0Ali Alexander\u00a0on Twitter. He\u00a0warned\u00a0his 126,000 followers that this may be a \u201csecond coup.\u201d", "A rumor spread across social media claiming that so-called \u201cdoomsday planes\u201d were deployed because of Trump\u2019s test result.", "They weren\u2019t.", "Two E-6B Mercury planes were in flight around the time that Trump announced he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. But the flights were pre-planned and the timing was coincidental, Karen Singer, spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. Training flights like those are usually planned a year in advance, Singer said.", "The planes, which have various nicknames, can be used as command centers and can launch land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. But that\u2019s not what they were doing at the time.", "An image that spread on Twitter early Oct. 2 purported to show an email from the president\u2019s reelection campaign and suggested that the president was immediately using the COVID-19 diagnosis to raise money.", "But as we reported, the Trump campaign confirmed to us that the image did not show an actual email from the campaign.", "Instead, the image appeared to be a joke.", "The bogus email claimed at one point that the goal was to raise \u201c421 million.\u201d", "That is the same figure referenced in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0investigation, which\u00a0found\u00a0that\u00a0Trump \u201cappears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.\u201d", "Critics of Trump reacted to the diagnosis by revisiting his handling of the pandemic. But some posts shared on social media distorted a statement that Trump made in February to do so.", "\u201cThe coronavirus. This is their new hoax,\u201d one Facebook meme misleadingly quoted Trump as saying.", "Another meme criticizing Trump, posted by the Occupy Democrats page and shared 21,000 times, also repeated the same, faulty quote.", "Trump didn\u2019t say \u201cthe coronavirus\u201d immediately before \u201cthis is their new hoax.\u201d That\u2019s how a Democratic super PAC later twisted the quote, as we wrote in April.", "The actual remark dates back to a Trump rally on Feb. 28, when the president referred to Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax\u201d after talking about the coronavirus. But, as we\u2019ve explained before, he said the next day that he was describing Democrats\u2019 finding fault with his administration\u2019s response to the virus, not the virus itself.", "Here\u2019s a transcript of what he said during the rally:", "Trump, Feb. 28: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u201cHow\u2019s President Trump doing?\u201d They go, \u201cOh, not good, not good.\u201d They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa. They can\u2019t even count. No, they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes.", "One of my people came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.", "Trump went on to praise his administration for some travel restrictions the U.S. had implemented. \u201cA virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn\u2019t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand the Democrats\u2019 single talking point, and you see it, is that it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault, right?\u201d", "The next day, when asked about his use of the word hoax, Trump said he was \u201ccertainly not\u201d referring to the virus itself.", "\u201c\u2018Hoax\u2019 referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we\u2019ve done such a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hoax is on them, not \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here; I\u2019m talking what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax. That\u2019s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it\u2019s the impeachment hoax or the \u2018Russia, Russia, Russia\u2019 hoax. This is what I\u2019m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
