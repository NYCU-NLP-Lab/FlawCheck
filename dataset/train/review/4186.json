["About this rating", "On 3 September 2017, the web site Freedom Daily rehashed an old (and largely untrue) rumor holding that a police union in Florida had announced that they would not protect Miami Dolphins players in retaliation for players kneeling during the National Anthem:", "The newest NFL Football team to make a fool out of themselves are the Miami Dolphins. They have followed the footsteps of the ungrateful millionaire spoiled brat ball players who are refusing to stand for the national anthem. But in this particular case, the Florida sheriffs office decided they won\u2019t be putting up with these player\u2019s crap, nor the silence of the NFL or the Miami Dolphin\u2019s association towards this disrespect.", "The Police Union has announced they will not be escorting the Miami Dolphins team members to their games until they start doing what all Americans should do and stand during the presentation of our nation\u2019s colors and the National Anthem is sung. The local Broward County police union has also made a statement that they won\u2019t be escorting the team either. Good for them!", "In the example above, the article begins by claiming that the \"Florida sheriffs office\" will not \"put up with this crap,\" and then ta", "This article is based on a grain of truth \u2014 a local police union urged officers and the Broward County Sheriff's Office in September 2016 not to participate in Miami Dolphins events \u2014 but it is outdated and contains several factual errors.", "In response to the growing number of NFL players who started to kneel during the National Anthem in protest of racial and social injustices, Jeffery Bell, the president of the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association, Local 6020, (which is affiliated with the International Union of Police Associations) posted a message to the union's Facebook page on 15 September 2016 urging officers not to work any detail associated with the Miami Dolphins:", "The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office Deputies Association Local 6020 is seeking the immediate termination of all Miami Dolphin escorts until such time the Miami Dolphins and the National Football League set forth a policy that will not tolerate the disrespect of the American Flag and National Anthem during any sanctioned games or events.", "[...]", "Until further notice, I respectfully ask all members of law enforcement not to work any detail associated with the Miami Dolphins unless ordered to do so. Again, I would also respectfully ask the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office to refuse any security details associated with the Miami Dolphins until such time the Miami Dolphin organization mandates a code of conduct for their players during all sanctioned events.", "The Freedom Daily writers failed to grasp two important concepts: A police union is not the same as a sheriff's office, and a request is not the same as a policy. These mistakes were even more obvious when the Freedom Daily first reported on this Facebook post in September 2016 in a story published under the factually inaccurate title \"Florida Sheriff\u2019s Office Will Not Escort Miami Dolphins Until They Stand For National Anthem.\"", "The \"Florida Sheriff's office,\" of course, made no such statement. For one thing, there is no \"Florida Sheriff's office\" -- sheriffs provide law enforcement at the county level. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at the time that his officers would continue to provide security for the Dolphins, despite the union's request:", "\"The recent protest by some Miami Dolphins players during the pregame national anthem will not interfere with BSO's job to ensure public safety at the games,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBSO\u2019s job is to protect the public, ensuring both players and spectators are safe.\"", "The Washington Post also noted that the Broward County officers who worked security for the Miami Dolphins did so in an off-duty capacity. While an individual officer could have chosen to turn down the detail, that would hardly constitute a department-wide boycott. Furthermore, a spokeswoman for the Broward County Sheriff's office said at the time that she didn't expect any sort of widespread protest:", "... Spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright noted that the deputies signed up for this duty long ago. \u201cOnce they sign up and it\u2019s approved,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re expected to show up for the detail. I haven\u2019t heard that we weren\u2019t going to have enough people.", "Other police forces, such as the Miami-Dade Police, have a contract to provide security at a venue. A spokesperson for the Miami-Dade Police, who also provide game day security for the Miami Dolphins, told the Miami Herald:", "[We have] contractual obligations with Hard Rock Stadium to provide public safety. The safety of our residents and visitors is our primary concern.", "In addition to misrepresenting the police union's statement, failing to report the police department's response, and spreading a false rumor concerning the Miami Dolphins' relationship with police officers, Freedom Daily also shared this article with a misleading photograph. The article's featured image does not show a Broward County official making this alleged announcement. This photograph actually shows Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco speaking to the media after a retired officer shot and killed a man at a movie theater in January 2014.", "WFTV 9. \u00a0 \"Sheriff: Protecting the Public Includes Miami Dolphins Protesting During the National Anthem.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 20 September 2016.", "Miami Herald. \u00a0 \"Police Union Asks Deputies to Not Escort Dolphins Until Players Stand for Anthem?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 September 2016.", "Jackman, Tom. \u00a0 \"If Colin Kaepernick has First Amendment Rights to Protest, Do the Police too?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Post. \u00a0 21 September 2016.", "Liston, Barbara. \u00a0 \"Man Shot Dead Over Texting Dispute in Florida Theater.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Reuters. \u00a0 13 January 2014.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
