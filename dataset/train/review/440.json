We rated that Mostly True, because Braley did miss close to that amount.", "However, Braley said he did not skip a hearing to raise money, so we\u2019re checking that claim here.", "A matter of scheduling", "The ad refers to a Sept. 20, 2012, meeting titled, \"Reviewing VA\u2019s Performance and Accountability.\" According to the official record, Braley was not present.", "The hearing touched on a number of issues within the Veterans Administration, such as mental health and homelessness.

It\u2019s possible he was there for part of the time, though, because the camera was not always pointed at his seat.", "Braley\u2019s campaign said he did attend three fundraisers that day, but they did not conflict with the hearings.
