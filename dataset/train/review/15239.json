["A Facebook\u00a0post published on February 6, 2021, and shared nearly 600 times\u00a0claims the WHO delisted \u201cNigeria from African countries to receive COVID-19 vaccine\u201d.", "The claim is based on an article within the post that reported how Nigeria had \u201cfailed to be shortlisted by the World Health Organisation-led COVAX global initiative for the global Pfizer vaccines following the country\u2019s inability to meet the standard requirement of being able to store the vaccines at the required -70 degrees Celsius (sic)\u201d.", "The claims were repeated in an almost identical version of the article by popular online newspaper Sahara Reporters, which said the WHO had disqualified Nigeria and eight other countries from the \u201cglobal vaccine bid\u201d known as COVAX.", "Both reports relied on a statement delivered by WHO Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti at a press conference held on February 4, 2021.", "Moeti\u2019s words, however, were taken out of context and the claims are false.", "AFP Fact Check reviewed\u00a0a video of Moeti\u2019s speech and a transcript available on the WHO's website and found that she did not say Nigeria had been disqualified from receiving COVAX-supplied vaccines, only that the country had failed to make the cut for the first consignment of jabs developed by Pfizer.", "Moeti explained that 13 African countries had applied to get the vaccines under the first batch of 320,000 doses that COVAX had allocated for the continent. Four nations were chosen based on various criteria \u2014 South Africa, Rwanda, Cape Verde\u00a0and Tunisia.", "\u201cThirteen African countries expressed an interest in participating in the initiative, and their proposals were evaluated based on current mortality rates, new cases and trends, and capacities to deliver this vaccine, including to store it at minus 70 degrees Celsius,\u201d Moeti said.", "Deciding who would get the first vaccines\u00a0\u201cwas a challenging process as we know all countries want to start vaccinating their populations\u201d. Moeti explained that the supplies were limited but \u201cwe are glad that we will have a number of countries start and we look forward to working with the other countries to expand this vaccine delivery\u201d.", "At the same briefing, Moeti said\u00a0\"nearly 90 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could start arriving on the continent\"\u00a0later in February.", "Following the publication of the false claims, WHO\u00a0Nigeria representative Walter Kazadi-Mulombo said that the agency had no power to disqualify a member state from getting approved vaccines.", "WHO is part of Covax facility and can never disqualify a Member State from accessing an approved vaccine for their population. I call upon members of the press in Nigeria and globally to contribute to fighting misinformation @WHONigeria.", "Nigeria's minister of health Osagie Ehanire told the nation at a public briefing that the country is expecting\u00a058 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses in total.", "He said COVAX will deliver 16 million doses\u00a0by the end of June 2021, while the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) run by the African Union will supply an additional 42 million doses.", "Responding to the claims that Nigeria was not selected to receive the Pfizer vaccine because it did not have\u00a0the\u00a0capacity to store it, Faisal Shuaib,\u00a0executive director\u00a0of\u00a0Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA),\u00a0said that Nigeria had the capacity to store 400,000 doses.", "\u201cWe have engaged private companies that will support the production of the dry ice to make sure that as we deploy the vaccines to the sub-national level, the vaccines retain their potency,\u201d\u00a0Shuaib\u00a0told journalists on February 6, 2021.", "As of February 13, 2021, Nigeria had recorded\u00a0144,521 cases of Covid-19 and 1,734 deaths from the disease.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
