["About this rating", "The career of eighteen-year-old Colombian torero \u00c1lvaro M\u00fanera (known by the nickname \"El Pilarico\") ended when he was gored by a bull during a bullfight in 1984, with the resultant spinal cord and cranial injuries leaving him paralyzed. M\u00fanera has since become a council member in his hometown of Medell\u00edn, a position from which he advocates for the rights of the disabled and promotes anti-bullfighting campaigns.", "A widely circulated photograph displayed above purports to have captured M\u00fanera at the very moment, in the middle of a bullfight, when he came to the realization that what he was doing was an injustice to animals and decided to henceforth campaign against bullfighting:", "MAKE THE CONNECTION.", "\"And suddenly, I looked at the bull. He had this innocence that all animals have in their eyes, and he looked at me with this pleading. It was like a cry for justice, deep down inside of me. I describe it as being like a prayer \u2014 because if one confesses, it is hoped, that one is forgiven. I felt like the worst shit on earth.\"", "This photo shows the collapse of Torrero Alvaro Munera, as he realized in the middle of his last fight ... the injustice to the animal. From that day forward he became an opponent of bullfights.", "Although M\u00fanera did undergo such a conversion, this photograph doesn't depict the instant of his change of heart, for a number of reasons:", "Q: Did you ever think of quitting bullfighting before that bull confined you to a wheelchair?", "A: Yes, there were several critical moments. Once I killed a pregnant heifer and saw how the fetus was extracted from her womb. The scene was so terrible that I puked and started to cry. I wanted to quit right there but my manager gave me a pat on my back and said I shouldn\u2019t worry, that I was going to be an important bullfighting figure and scenes like that were a normal thing to see in this profession. I\u2019m sorry to say that I missed that first opportunity to stop. I was 14 and didn\u2019t have enough common sense. Some time later, in an indoor fight, I had to stick my sword in five or six times to kill a bull. The poor animal, his entrails pouring out, still refused to die. He struggled with all his strength until the last breath. This caused a very strong impression on me, and yet again I decided it wasn\u2019t the life for me. But my travel to Spain was already arranged, so I crossed the Atlantic. Then came the third chance, the definitive one. It was like God thought, \u201cIf this guy doesn\u2019t want to listen to reason, he\u2019ll have to learn the hard way.\u201d And of course I learned.", "Q: What was the decisive factor that made you an animal-rights defender?", "When I went to the U.S. [for medical treatment], where I had to face an antitaurine society that cannot conceive how another society can allow the torture and murder of animals. It was my fellow students, the doctors, nurses, the other physically disabled people, my friends, my North American girlfriend, and the aunt of one of my friends, who said I deserved what happened to me. Their arguments were so solid that I had to accept that it was me who was wrong and that the 99 percent of the human race who are firmly against this sad and cruel form of entertainment were totally right. Many times the whole of the society is not to blame for the decisions of their governments. Proof of this is that most people in Spain and Colombia are genuinely anti-bullfighting. Unfortunately there\u2019s a minority of torturers in each government supporting these savage practices.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
