["The president made the statement on May 10 in a televised broadcast about the novel coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, which was also widely viewed on Facebook.", "\u201cOur country has administered more tests per million people than any other country in Africa, and, in fact, the World Health Organization... has reached out to us to share our sample-pooling experience with other African countries, so they can adopt this strategy and also ramp up their testing capabilities,\u201d he said in his ninth address on the crisis.", "He also urged Ghanaians to disregard politicians who allege the country\u2019s COVID-19 numbers represent a failure on the part of the government because \u201cthey need to make such comments for their political survival\u201d.", "Akufo-Addo is left with barely a year to complete his first term in office, and is facing a tough fight for reelection in December against former leader John Mahama.", "At least 5,127\u00a0people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Ghana as of May 12, 2020, making it the worst-hit country in the West African\u00a0region. The government has extended the closure of its borders until May 31, 2020, to try to stem the\u00a0virus spread.", "Akufo-Addo\u2019s claim about leading Africa in tests per million inhabitants was featured in several local and international news reports, including by\u00a0Africa News and The New York Times.", "But the claim is false. To verify this, AFP compared available data from Ghana to that of five other countries: Nigeria, the most populous African nation; South Africa, which has administered the highest number of tests overall according to the Africa Centres\u00a0for Disease Control and Prevention; and Mauritius, Botswana and Djibouti, because while much smaller in population, these countries have conducted relatively high numbers of tests.", "Of these five, AFP found that Nigeria and Botswana rank lower than Ghana in COVID-19 tests per million people, while South Africa, Djibouti and Mauritius rank higher.", "This figure is calculated by dividing the country\u2019s number of COVID-19 tests by its total population, and then multiplying the result by one million.", "According to official figures from each country\u00a0as of May 10, 2020, Nigeria had conducted 27,078 COVID-19 tests; South Africa, 341,336 tests; Ghana, 160,501 tests (see 4\u201925\u201d in the president\u2019s speech); Botswana, 9,540 tests;\u00a0 Mauritius, 73,572 tests; and Djibouti, 15,304 tests.", "This, in comparison with the five countries\u2019 population figures, gives us the following rankings:", "When President Akufo-Addo made the claim, Ghana had conducted 5,300\u00a0tests for every million\u00a0inhabitants --\u00a0higher than Nigeria\u2019s 135\u00a0tests per million and Botswana\u2019s 4,079\u00a0tests per million but below South Africa (5,808\u00a0per million), Djibouti (15,713\u00a0per million), and Mauritius (57,931\u00a0per million).", "AFP has contacted the Ghanaian presidency for comment but has not yet received a response.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
