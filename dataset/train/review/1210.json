Bernie Sanders? It did, and it remains unclear why, though Sanders wasn't the only candidate left off.", "The infographic aired during a report on Iowa's Polk County Steak Fry, an event on Sept. 21, 2019, that drew 17 candidates to Iowa ahead of that state's caucuses, including Sanders, an Independent from Vermont who is running as a Democrat.", "It's unclear why the graphic pictured only 10 candidates, even as host Richard Lui reported that 17 were present at the Iowa event. But a screenshot of the image ricocheted around social media alongside claims that MSNBC was suppressing news about Sanders.

Nine of the 10 candidates pictured attended a forum in Iowa on LGBTQ civil rights issues (Joe Sestak, a former U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, attended the forum but was not pictured).", "The screen-captured graphic is likely one piece of visual information taken out of a larger context. A simple Google search for the terms \u201cMSNBC\u201d and \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d reveals that the network regularly covers Sanders, while a search on the television-monitoring site TVEyes reveals mentions of Bernie Sanders appeared in closed-captioning 26 times on MSNBC over the weekend in question.", "The Iowa caucus is seen as an important benchmark in Democratic primary races because it comes first and is often, though not always, an indicator of who will get the party's nomination for the general election.", "Pfannenstiel, Brianne.\u00a0\"Largest Polk County Steak Fry in History Draws 12,000 Attendees, 17 Presidential Candidates.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Des Moines Register.\u00a021 September 2019.", "Fitzsimons, Tim.\u00a0\"Democratic 2020 Hopefuls Tout Their Pride at Iowa LGBTQ Forum.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0NBC News.\u00a020 September 2019.", "Ulmer, Clare.\u00a0\"Why Is Iowa First?
