We learned that while she did indeed find a valuable coin as a young girl, she kept it for more than a decade before any authorities learned of its existence.", "The above photograph also does not show the actual girl from the story, whose real photograph was featured in this Express U.K. article.", "Kate Harding was only 9 years old when she found the silver coin in her childhood home. In 2009, when she was in her early 20s, she showed the artifact to museum experts, who identified it as a 14th-century silver coin and told her she had to report the find to a coroner, who is an independent judicial officer.", "She didn't do so, and in February 2010, she was investigated for breaching the Treasure Act, which is a 1996 law that obliges finders of such objects to report the find to their local coroner, who determines whether the item is truly a treasure.", "She became the first in the U.K. convicted of failing to report a treasure, according to local police.

In February 2010, she was given a three month conditional discharge, ordered to hand over the artifact, and pay \u00a325 (the U.S. equivalent of around $33). But her lawyers appealed the case, saying that the coin was in her possession before the Treasure Act came into force. The Crown Prosecution Service subsequently dropped the case, and she handed the object over to a local coroner, who would complete a full inquest to determine the full value and ownership of the coin.", "The coin was said to be worth around \u00a32,000 (the U.S. equivalent of around $2,600). Also called a piedfort \u2014 a coin struck on an unusually thick metal disc that is believed to originate from France \u2014 it reportedly marked Charles IV\u2019s ascension to the French throne in 1322. According to the\u00a0 regional newspaper, Shropshire Star, the piedfort was not officially classified as a coin during the inquest, as it was thought to have been used for ceremonial purposes and not as a means of payment.", "Given that the woman did indeed find a rare item but managed to keep it for years before authorities confronted her about it, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
