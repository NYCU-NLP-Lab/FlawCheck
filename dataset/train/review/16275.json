Mike Huckabee questioned the motives and origins of \"so-called \u2018Syrian refugees\u2019 \" during the Nov. 10 undercard GOP debate.", "While Huckabee, a former pastor, says he\u2019s concerned about the plight of Christians in the region, he dismissed the idea of the United States accepting whoever \u2014\u00a0as he put it \u2014\u00a0wants free sandwiches and health care.", "\"We have no idea who these people are. What we do know is only one out of five of the so-called \u2018Syrian refugees\u2019 who went into Europe were actually Syrian,\" Huckabee said. \"Are we \u00a0going to open the door so ISIS people can come on in, and we\u2019ll give them a place to stay and a good sandwich and medical benefits?\"", "We were curious about Huckabee\u2019s claim that the majority of the refugees don\u2019t come from Syria.", "Huckabee\u2019s spokesperson Hogan Gidley told us his source was the Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s official statistical agency. He also forwarded us an article in the Daily Mail that said \"four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria.\" (The article\u2019s findings were repeated by some conservative American media outlets.)", "We found that the Daily Mail\u2019s and Huckabee\u2019s statistic represents the situation in the three months before the Syrian migrants actually began arriving in Europe in bulk. Looking at the whole picture, asylum seekers from Syria represent half of all refugees.", "According to the Daily Mail, the European Union \"logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war.\" Those figures are lifted from Eurostat\u2019s latest asylum quarterly report. But the Daily Mail\u2019s use of data is flawed, and Huckabee\u2019s extrapolation even more so.", "First, the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian as Huckabee\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u00a0\"so-called Syrian refugees\" \u2014 suggests. There is anecdotal evidence of people using fake or stolen passports, but the refugees in Eurostat\u2019s tally hail from other countries that are experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq and Kosovo.", "The Guardian\u00a0explains why this distorts the refugee situation: \"If you lump this group in with those who crossed the Mediterranean to claim asylum, the number of Syrians will naturally seem smaller. But this is to conflate two largely separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states.\"", "(Huckabee\u2019s point was that media reports conflated the the Syrian refugees and those who were not, Gidley told us.)", "And last and most importantly, the 44,000 figure only represents a three-month period. This is \"particularly problematic\" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, pointed out the Guardian. Here\u2019s a chart with data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 Syria page to that point:", "If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.", "Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively.", "Our ruling", "Huckabee said, \"Only one out of five of the so-called \u2018Syrian refugees\u2019 who went into Europe were actually Syrian.\"", "While the claim isn\u2019t pulled out of thin air, it\u2019s flawed. The statistic represents the three months before the actual influx of Syrian refugees, and the four out of five non-Syrians are not purporting to be Syrian. Rather, they came from war-torn countries.", "Overall, Syrian refugees account for half of all refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 so far.", "We rate Huckabee\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "Fox Business, GOP debate, Nov. 10, 2015", "Phone and email interviews with Hogan Gidley, spokesperson for Mike Huckabee, Nov. 10-11, 2015", "Washington Post, \"Fact Check: Huckabee's false claim that only 1 in 5 refugees are Syrian,\" Nov. 10, 2015", "Daily Mail, \"Four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria,\" Sept. 18, 2015", "Eurostat, \"First time asylum applicants in the EU,\" Sept. 16, 2015", "Eurostat, \"Asylum quarterly report,\" Sept. 16, 2015", "The Guardian, \"Three problems with the Daily Mail\u2019s story about Syrian refugees,\" Sept. 19, 2015", "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Refugees/Migrants Emergency Response - Mediterranean,\" accessed Nov. 10, 2015", "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Syria Regional Refugee Response,\" Nov. 3, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
