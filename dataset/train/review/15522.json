(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)", "President Donald Trump posted on Twitter last week that Sen. Charles Schumer flip-flopped on the Iran nuclear deal.", "The tweet came two days after Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Obama deal \u2014 a move Schumer criticized.", "\"Senator Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!\" Trump tweeted. \"Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn\u2019t really believe that!\"", "Trump promised during his campaign to renegotiate the Iran deal, an agreement he opposed since its inception. Then-President Barack Obama announced the pact with five other countries and Iran to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities in exchange for lighter sanctions in 2015.", "Is Trump right about Schumer\u2019s record on the deal?", "Schumer in 2015", "A spokesperson for Trump referred us to comments Schumer made about the Iran deal in 2015.", "Obama announced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran nuclear deal, in July of that year.", "The agreement did not require a vote from Congress because it wasn\u2019t a trade deal. Past deals, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, had to be approved by Congress before they were implemented.", "Instead, Republicans who controlled the Senate introduced a measure to reject Obama\u2019s deal.", "Schumer came out against the deal about a month before the Senate voted on the measure. In a statement, he said he would vote against the deal for three reasons:", "\u2022 The U.S. could not unilaterally demand inspections of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites at any time.", "\u2022 Iran would have more resources to develop nuclear weapons after a decade of lighter sanctions, Schumer argued. As we\u2019ve rated before, Iran was not free to build nuclear weapons after a decade.", "\u2022 Iran would also have more money to expand its influence in the region. The U.S. State Department has labeled the country a state sponsor of terrorism.", "Schumer wanted to keep the sanctions on Iran and pursue a different path to denuclearization.", "\"I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power,\" Schumer said.", "A few days after his break with Obama, Schumer said the U.S. \"should go back and try to get a better deal.\"", "He voted to reject the nuclear agreement but Republicans in the Senate didn\u2019t have enough votes to send the measure to Obama. Schumer was one of four Democrats to support it.", "When asked after the 2016 election if he would support leaving the deal with Trump as president, Schumer told POLITICO he wanted to see how it played out for a few years and that \"it would be wrong to repeal it now.\"", "Schumer in 2018", "Schumer has been critical of Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the deal he once opposed.", "A reporter asked him earlier this month if he supported leaving the deal based on his position in 2015.", "\"No. There are no reports that Iran has violated the agreement and to me, the greatest worries from Iran are not right now the nuclear side,\" Schumer said,\"but rather what they\u2019re doing in Syria, what they\u2019re doing to arm Hezbollah with rockets.\"", "Schumer said he wants the U.S. to work with its allies to curb Iran\u2019s influence in the region while maintaining the country\u2019s nuclear restrictions.", "He clarified his position on the Senate floor a few days later.", "\"Telling Iran, you continue giving missiles to Hezbollah, you continue sending troops to Iran, you continue your stuff with the Houthis, developing missiles, we\u2019re going to put additional sanctions on you,\" Schumer said. \"That to me is the smartest thing to do.\"", "Schumer also said he did not regret voting against the deal in 2015.", "\"I didn\u2019t think the deal was a good deal. Proud I voted no,\" Schumer said. \"But at this time and this place for so many reasons, pulling out precipitously without our allies involved, does not achieve any of the goals we need to achieve and hurts Americans in different ways.\"", "Our ruling", "Trump said Schumer wants to keep the U.S. in the Iran nuclear deal after opposing it three years ago.", "That\u2019s all true. Schumer came out against the Iran deal and voted to reject it in 2015.
