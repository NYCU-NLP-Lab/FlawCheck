Fitzhugh Brundage, professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact in an email.", "\"What is clear is that Lee did not oppose slavery to the degree that he was willing to take any meaningful steps against the institution. Finally, during the Civil War Lee used his army in various ways to bolster and sustain the institution of slavery. So while Lee never endorsed slavery as a positive good (a la James Henry Hammond) he got no further than wringing his hands over the institution and lamenting its existence. After the Civil War he displayed clear hostility to black equality of any kind.\"", "Lee personally enslaved people who he inherited after his mother died in 1829. Then, in 1857, following the death of his father-in-law, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people working between the two estates.

It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.\"", "But he goes on to say that slavery was \"a greater evil to the white man than to the black race\" and \"while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former.\" Lee wrote that African Americans were \"immeasurably better off\" in the U.S. than in Africa and that the \"painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race.\"", "Eric Foner, a Civil War historian and Columbia University professor, referred us to a passage he wrote on Lee\u2019s connection with slavery in the New York Times Book Review:", "\"During his lifetime, Lee owned a small number of slaves. He considered himself a paternalistic master but could also impose severe punishments, especially on those who attempted to run away. Lee said almost nothing in public about the institution. His most extended comment, quoted by all biographers, came in a letter to his wife in 1856. Here he described slavery as an evil, but one that had more deleterious effects on whites than blacks. He felt that the \u2018painful discipline\u2019 to which they were subjected benefitted blacks by elevating them from barbarism to civilization and introducing them to Christianity. The end of slavery would come in God's good time, but this might take quite a while, since to God a thousand years was just a moment. Meanwhile, the greatest danger to the \u2018liberty\u2019 of white southerners was the \u2018evil course\u2019 pursued by the abolitionists, who stirred up sectional hatred. In 1860, Lee voted for John C. Breckenridge, the extreme proslavery candidate (a more moderate southerner, John Bell, carried Virginia that year).\"", "\"I would not say that this qualifies Lee as \u2018against slavery,\u2019\" Foner added in the email.", "John Reeves, author of \"The Lost Indictment of Robert E.

In an interview after his surrender, Reeves says, Lee said that \"the best men of the South\" were eager to do away with it, and in a testimony in 1866 he had \"always been in favor of emancipation \u2014 gradual emancipation.\"", "But Reeves writes that the historical record doesn\u2019t support these statements, as Lee and his family owned and managed slaves for decades and benefited \"tremendously\" from the institution.", "A Facebook post says Robert E.
