The image also included one internet user's response to the story: \"So the limit is 412\":", "This image does not refer to a genuine news article. This rumor originated with a fictitious article published on the entertainment website 8satire.com entitled \"Man Rushed To Hospital After Eating 413 Chicken Nuggets\":", "25-year old Anthony Thomas has been taken to the hospital in an ambulance after eating 413 chicken nuggets and getting paralyzed. The young man, who was at McDonald\u2019s eating lunch, decided to break his own record of 200 chicken nuggets eaten within an hour. He wanted to double his own record, and he achieved plus 13 more, even though it cost him everything.", "\u201cHe\u2019s always trying to break his own records, but I never thought he would take it this far\u201d, said the mom of Thomas, who was very worried about the situation. She went to the hospital to congratulate her son for such an achievement and especially, for still being alive.", "8satire.com carries a disclaimer labeling its content as satire:", "8Shit is a satire news and humor website.

That article, which claimed a man went into a coma after eating 413 Red Lobster Biscuits (not nuggets), was mistaken as a genuine news item by outlets such as UK\u2019s Daily Star and Daily Mirror, and Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail.
