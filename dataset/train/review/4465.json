["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 24, 2020 | Updated on July 14, 2020", "Update, July 14: This story was published before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0began advising\u00a0people to wear face coverings in public settings. Many states now have\u00a0laws mandating masks in public settings. Our most recent coverage on COVID-19 can be\u00a0found here.\u00a0We have updated the Quick Take.\u00a0The original story is as follows.", "As the health care system in the U.S. faces shortages of face masks and other protective gear for workers fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic, some Facebook posts are sending the wrong message by claiming that wearing a face mask is now a requirement for everyone.", "The posts falsely claim that \u201ceveryone is required to wear mask everywhere,\u201d because \u201cCOVID-19\u201d \u2014 the disease caused by the virus \u2014 \u201cis confirmed as airborne and remain 8 hrs in air!\u201d", "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend face masks for healthy people, but says they should be worn \u201cby people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms.\u201d It notes that the \u201cuse of facemasks also is crucial for health workers\u00a0and other\u00a0people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\u201d", "So there\u2019s no requirement that \u201ceveryone\u201d wear a mask at all times.", "The Facebook posts further leave a misleading impression when saying the coronavirus (formally known as SARS-CoV-2) is \u201cairborne and remain 8 hrs in air!\u201d The term \u201cairborne,\u201d we note, is used differently by different people and is the subject of some debate.", "Public health officials have thus far said they do not believe the virus is widely spread through the air. But new studies suggest air transmission could be a factor, especially in health care settings.", "A study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine called aerosol transmission \u201cplausible.\u201d The study involved an experiment using a nebulizer to show that the virus \u201cremained viable in aerosols\u201d for up to three hours. The term \u201caerosol\u201d refers to virus particles being suspended in the air; more on that shortly.", "But, importantly, the study estimated that the virus had a half-life of approximately 1.1 to 1.2 hours in aerosols \u2014 meaning half of the viral particles were no longer infectious after a little over an hour.", "The amount of virus projected into the air would affect the total time that some of it remains infectious, according to Dylan Morris, a Princeton University researcher and co-author of the study. Certain conditions, such as humidity, could also affect how long it remains infectious.", "The Facebook posts, however, leave the unfounded impression that the virus is infectious in the air for \u201c8 hrs.\u201d A CNBC article referenced in the posts does not claim as much.", "Morris told us by email that \u201cthe \u2018airborne\u2019 question bedevils scientists trying to communicate with the public. It combines a locus of substantial public fear with a question of true scientific nuance \u2014 a recipe for a misinformation mess.\u201d", "\u201cMany viruses \u2014 from measles to flu, and including SARS-CoV-2\u00a0\u2014 are \u2018airborne\u2019 in the sense that one way of getting sick is to inhale virus particles (\u2018virions\u2019) sneezed or coughed into the air within respiratory secretions,\u201d he said. Some secretions are bigger (often called \u201cdroplets\u201d) and some smaller (thought of as \u201caerosols\u201d), he said, though there\u2019s a spectrum.", "\u201cThe tricky crux of the matter is that when people say \u2018airborne\u2019, what they often mean is \u2018you\u2019re at risk from virus particles hanging in the air \u2014 or being kicked back up into the air after falling to the ground \u2014 long, long after an infectious person sneezed them out,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s much more of a risk for smaller, \u2018aerosol\u2019-end-of-the-spectrum secretions. And it turns out that it\u2019s more of a risk for some viruses than for others.\u201d", "Measles is very airborne, he said, but the flu is less so \u2014 \u201ceven though both measles and flu can in principle be found both in aerosol-like and in droplet-like secretions. So far, scientists mainly think COVID looks more like flu\u201d in that way.", "Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, said we don\u2019t have enough evidence of how exactly the coronavirus is being spread between people.", "\u201cWe do know transmission is much more likely if you\u2019re close to someone who\u2019s sick,\u201d Marr said. In terms of the virus being potentially transmitted in the air, she uses the analogy of being directly next to someone smoking a cigarette; the farther away you are from someone releasing the virus into the air, the lesser the concentration.", "\u201cThe \u2018airborne\u2019 term scares people \u2014 they envision this cloud of viruses that roams around the neighborhood that can infect them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe important thing [to know] is that virus released in the air from a patient is usually quickly diluted unless you\u2019re in a really small space.\u201d And over time, the \u201clevel of risk becomes much, much lower.\u201d", "Marr added that larger droplets could also land on the floor or a desk, surfaces which people may touch and then touch their faces or mouths \u2014 also putting them at risk of infection. That\u2019s why public health officials stress frequent hand-washing.", "And while the Facebook posts suggest the \u201cairborne\u201d factor necessitates the healthy public at large (\u201ceveryone\u201d) wear masks \u201ceverywhere,\u201d experts say it\u2019s health care workers who truly need them most.", "\u201cWhere nobody disagrees is that there are frighteningly plausible aerosol transmission risks in hospital settings, since medical procedures involved in treating COVID can produce aerosols,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThis is a major reason why hospitals are in such critical need of appropriate protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers (e.g. N95 masks).\u201d", "Marr, too, said the limited supply is most needed by health care workers.", "\u201cIf there is a shortage of masks, which is the case here, then they should be reserved for health care workers,\u201d she said. \u201cEven coughing, breathing and talking can generate aerosols,\u201d she said, so \u201chealth care workers close to patients \u2026 should be wearing proper respiratory protection.\u201d", "Morris suggests that members of the public, some of whom could be infected but not show symptoms, can follow online tutorials to create their own surgical masks \u2014 covering the nose and mouth \u2014 to wear in public settings, like the grocery store. While such masks don\u2019t prevent the person wearing it from becoming infected, they can help those who are unknowingly sick avoid inadvertently contaminating the environment.", "In short, there is emerging evidence that the virus may be \u201cairborne,\u201d but that term requires context and experts say the primary concern is direct contact with people infected with the disease. And the idea that the virus remains infectious in the air for \u201c8 hrs\u201d is not supported \u2014 and there\u2019s no requirement that people wear masks at all times.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
