These came as reprisal attacks following a wave of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, including many directed against Nigerian-owned businesses and properties.", "While tensions have been high between the two countries, neither the South African high commission nor the consulate-general in Nigeria have been hit by a bomb attack during this month\u2019s unrest.", "The Nigerian government dismissed claims of a bomb attack against one of South Africa\u2019s diplomatic mission as \u201cfake news\u201d.", "\u201cThe video of the purported bomb explosion which is being circulated on the social media, is that of the bomb explosion at Emab plaza, near Banex, in Abuja on June 25, 2014,\u201d read a statement from Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture.", "The Nigerian Police Force also called the video \u201canother classical example of a disingenuous piece of Fake News\u201d.", "The above video is another classical example of a disingenuous piece of Fake News.

The bombing at the Emab Plaza shopping mall, which killed at least 21 people, was widely reported at the time, including by AFP.", "We wanted to confirm if the video was really filmed at the scene of the Abuja bombing.", "Using video verification tool\u00a0inVID, we found that still frames within the video had been on the internet for a long time.
