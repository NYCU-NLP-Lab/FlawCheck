He received\u00a0a record tally of more than 81\u00a0million votes.", "A reverse image search using Google reveals that the photos in the post are authentic, but the comparison is misleading.", "The top left photos show Trump rallies in Arizona in October 2020. One exactly matches\u00a0a photo tweeted by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany here and the other is almost identical to these AFP photos here and here.", "In the top right of the post, a photo shows an Obama rally in St Louis, Missouri in October 2008, where the former president, in his final run for the White House, drew a record 100,000-plus crowd. A similar AFP photo of the event can be found here. Another photo of his Democatric nomination acceptance speech in Denver, Colorado that summer can also be seen in the post.", "The bottom part of the image is divided between four socially-distanced events held by Biden during his 2020 campaign.", "The top left photo is a Reuters photo taken by Kevin Lamarque in June, available here.

It was tweeted by a local reporter, on October 27, 2020. Only that image depicts a Biden rally open to the public.", "Trump decided to continue holding rallies throughout 2020, even as coronavirus outbreaks increased across the US.

I really miss being able to, you know, grab hands, shake hands,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that now.
