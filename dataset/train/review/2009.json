["About this rating", "A popular November 2018 U.S. election night Twitter thread, created by writer and Twitter user Ally Maynard, followed a collection of candidates President Trump had supported on Twitter for the 2018 midterm elections. Each time an endorsed candidate lost, she tweeted a picture of the President\u2019s endorsement of that candidate:", "Trump has endorsed 11 Republicans running for Governor, 31 House candidates and 13 Senate candidates and I've screenshot every one of them and will let him know every one that loses.", "\u2014 Ally Maynard (@missmayn) November 7, 2018", "Based on this Twitter thread, the website \u201cGritpost\u201d did some back-of-the-envelope-calculations to derive a headline claim that \u201c71 Percent of Trump-Endorsed Candidates Lost Their Elections Last Night\u201d:", "Twitter user Ally Maynard painstakingly compiled a list of 55 House, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates President Trump either held rallies for or endorsed on Twitter, and found that 39 of them lost, meaning 70.9 percent of candidates President Trump endorsed were defeated.", "While this figure might be accurate if limited exclusively to Twitter endorsements (though we have not investigated that approach), the headline claim regarding \u201c71 percent of Trump-endorsed candidates\u201d is false, as it implies that 71 percent of all the candidates President Trump endorsed lost their election bids.", "If we consider \u201cHouse, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates\u201d as the pool of endorsements, Donald Trump issued 93 endorsements of candidates running in U.S. Senate, U.S. House, and gubernatorial races. (This figure does not include endorsements for primary elections or for non-gubernatorial positions in state governments.) Of that endorsement pool, as of 9 November 2018 some 50 candidates had won their election bids, 37 had lost, and six remained in races still too close to call. Conservatively speaking, that means Trump\u2019s endorsements won at least 54% of their races and at most lost 41% of them: a far cry from the 71% the headline suggested.", "Below is a list of each of the Congressional and gubernatorial candidates President Trump endorsed, broken down by outcome (Updated 12 November 2018):", "Trump-endorsed candidates who won their races (50):", "Trump-endorsed candidates who lost their races (38):", "Trump endorsed candidates whose races have not yet been called (5):", "Cahil, Tom. \u00a0 \"71 Percent of Trump-Endorsed Candidates Lost Their Elections Last Night.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Gritpost. \u00a0 7 November 2018.", "The New York Times. \u00a0 \"Senate Election Results: Republicans Keep Majority.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 9 November 2018.", "The New York Times. \u00a0 \"House Election Results: Democrats Take Control.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 9 November 2018.", "The New York Times. \u00a0 \"Governor Election Results: Democrats Retake Several States.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 9 November 2018.", "Correction [12 November 2018]: An earlier version of this post omitted Trump's endorsement of Scott Wagner (PA Governor), and incorrectly listed Jay Webber (NJ-11) as winning his race.", "Update [12 November 2018]: Updated with new information.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
