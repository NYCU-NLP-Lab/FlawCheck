["Thousands of Facebook users have recently shared a photo of a shirtless man raising his arms, revealing dozens of little red spots on the side of his torso. Next to him stands a man in uniform, wearing a hospital glove. Above the photo, a caption reads:", "\u201cThe bumps on this illegal\u2019s body who was detained from the Caravan @ the Border is smallpox. Over \u00bd of the detainees from that Caravan have tested positive for Tuberculosis which there is no vaccine for. Is the border wall starting to look good now?\u201d", "A variation of the same photo was shared with a similar claim about smallpox in December 2018.", "Although the image is real, both posts are false.", "The man is not a member of one of the migrant caravans that travelled from Central America to the US in 2018 and 2019, the largest of which totalled about 7,000 people in October 2018 according to the United Nations.

In 2014, a scabies outbreak spread in immigration detention centers and border patrol stations in South Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley, amid a surge in irregular border crossings. Here is a report from a local news station on the outbreak.", "The false post also claims that half of the members of the migrant caravan are infected with tuberculosis, and that no vaccine exists to cure it.", "According to the CDC, the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is a vaccine for tuberculosis which is given to children in countries where the disease is highly prevalent.
