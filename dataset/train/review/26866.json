["About this rating", "On 20 February 2018 the satirical web site Reductress turned a Black Panther tie-in piece into a swipe at racial profiling by law enforcement -- and did it well enough that readers contacted us asking if the story was real.", "According to the site, the cast of the Marvel Entertainment film was placed on a Federal Bureau of Investigation's watch list for \"domestic terror organizations\":", "Sources report that A-list celebrities Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong\u2019o have been added to the watch list, with little justification other than seeming \"suspicious.\"", "\"It's an imperfect process,\" says one source within the FBI. \"But if anything uses the words 'black' and 'panther' we're all over it.\"", "The cast is not on any \"watch list\"; the site makes it clear that its stories are fabricated.
