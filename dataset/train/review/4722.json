["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on February 12, 2021 | Updated on May 14, 2021", "A video falsely claims that people receiving\u00a0authorized\u00a0COVID-19 vaccines are taking part in\u00a0a\u00a0deadly\u00a0clinical trial and that those administering the\u00a0doses\u00a0are war criminals under the Nuremberg Code. That\u2019s bogus. People getting the vaccines, which have been shown to be safe and effective, consent to receive them and aren\u2019t participating in research.", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "More than\u00a0half a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain \u2014 or no side effects at all. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said, these vaccines \u201chave undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\u201d", "A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated. Approximately 5 per million people vaccinated have experienced anaphylaxis after a COVID-19 vaccine, according\u00a0to the CDC.", "To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn\u2019t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.", "There is evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in male adolescents and young adults.", "Based on data collected through August 2021, the reporting rates of either condition in the U.S. are highest in males 16 to 17 years old after the second dose (105.9 cases per million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), followed by 12- to 15-year-old males (70.7 cases per million). The rate for 18- to 24-year-old males was 52.4 cases and 56.3 cases per million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively.", "Health officials have emphasized that vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated \u201cresponded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly.\u201d", "The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an\u00a0increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, especially in women ages 30\u00a0to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and\u00a0include\u00a0severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.", "According to the CDC, TTS has occurred in around 4 people per million doses administered. As of early April,\u00a0the syndrome has been confirmed in 60 cases, including nine deaths, after more than 18.6 million doses of the J&J vaccine. Although TTS remains rare, because of the availability of mRNA vaccines, which are not associated with this serious side effect, the FDA on May 5 limited authorized use of the J&J vaccine to adults who either couldn\u2019t get one of the other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines because of medical or access reasons, or only wanted a J&J vaccine for protection against the disease. Several months earlier, on Dec. 16, 2021,\u00a0the CDC had recommended the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots over J&J\u2019s.", "The J&J vaccine has also been linked to an increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks nerve cells.\u00a0Most people\u00a0who develop GBS fully recover, although some have permanent nerve damage and the condition can be fatal.", "Safety surveillance data suggest that compared with the mRNA vaccines, which have not been linked to GBS, the J&J vaccine is associated with 15.5 additional GBS cases per million doses of vaccine in the three weeks following vaccination. Most reported cases following J&J vaccination have occurred in men 50 years old and older.", "Link to this", "A popular video from a British conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist makes a slew of false claims about government-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, including the incorrect notion that they are \u201cexperimental\u201d and that the clinicians administering them are violating the Nuremberg Code.", "That\u2019s wrong on both counts. While phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccines are continuing as planned to collect additional data, that doesn\u2019t mean the immunizations are experimental or that people who are now getting vaccinated are participating in a trial.", "Moreover, nothing about the Nuremberg Code applies to the situation, as people getting the vaccines are doing so as part of their own medical care, not research. They also consent to receive the jabs and information about the vaccines is widely available.", "The video also baselessly claims that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and tantamount to a \u201cglobal genocide,\u201d citing deaths that have not been proven to be from vaccines.", "The claims are made in a 15-minute video by Dr. Vernon Coleman, a former general practitioner in the U.K. who is no longer registered to practice medicine. Coleman has a history of peddling discredited medical information and has argued that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax and that AIDS does not exist.", "The video has been shared on multiple Facebook pages and appears on various websites, including a site run by Charlie Ward, a man who has previously made false claims about COVID-19 vaccines.", "The U.K.\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for use during the pandemic: Oxford University and AstraZeneca\u2019s viral vectored vaccine, Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s mRNA vaccine and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccine. The U.S.\u2019s Food and Drug Administration has authorized the latter two for emergency use. (See SciCheck\u2019s guides to those here and here.)", "In the video, Coleman claims the COVID-19 vaccine is \u201cexperimental\u201d and says because the vaccine trials are still ongoing, \u201cEveryone having the vaccine is therefore taking part in an experiment.\u201d", "He then goes on to claim that people giving the vaccines are legally war criminals under the Nuremberg Code.", "\u201cThe Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation written in 1947 \u2026 stated that explicit, voluntary consent from patients is required for human experimentation,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means that patients must be told that they\u2019re taking part in a trial and they must be warned of all the possible adverse events. That\u2019s what informed consent means. \u2026 And so legally, all those people giving vaccinations are war criminals.\u201d", "\u201cEveryone giving the COVID-19 vaccines without explaining that \u2026 it\u2019s an experiment and without listing all the possible adverse events is a war criminal,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s not rhetoric. It\u2019s not opinion. It\u2019s fact.\u201d", "Except that it\u2019s not fact. People receiving the authorized vaccines are not participating in clinical trials. And because it\u2019s not research, the Nuremberg Code has no bearing on anything \u2014 even though ethically, everything is still above board. No one is in danger of being a war criminal.", "Holly Fernandez Lynch, an assistant professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine told us the claims were \u201cridiculous.\u201d", "The Nuremberg Code, as we\u2019ve explained before, is a code of research ethics created in the wake of the Nazis\u2019 horrific treatment of human subjects in experiments during the Holocaust. One of its primary principles is that individuals participating in research should do so voluntarily and with adequate information about the experiment to make an informed decision.", "Fernandez Lynch confirmed that Nuremberg only pertains to research and would have nothing to do with any COVID-19 vaccines given outside of a trial. But even if it did, the claim is bogus.", "\u201cPeople are consenting to get the vaccine,\u201d she said. So even if Nuremberg was applicable here, \u201cit\u2019s not non-consensual. And no information is being hidden. It\u2019s all very front and center.\u201d", "In the U.S., the FDA, for example, provides fact sheets for vaccine recipients that clearly state the findings of the clinical trials \u2014 including the potential risks and benefits \u2014 and a description of an emergency use authorization. An EUA is a bit different than full FDA approval, although the agency required a high level of evidence from a large, phase 3 randomized controlled trial.", "Fernandez Lynch acknowledged, as the FDA does, that not everything is known about the vaccine, but noted that no one was being forced to be vaccinated and that there was full transparency.", "\u201cWe ideally would be able to watch for longer to gather more safety information about these products, but we have to make tradeoffs when we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd each individual person is going to have to decide whether those tradeoffs are acceptable to them.\u201d", "As our colleagues at Reuters have written, people in the U.K. give informed consent to be vaccinated, as outlined in the country\u2019s Green Book. The consent forms for the COVID-19 vaccines are available on the government\u2019s website.", "In making his argument, Coleman focuses on the fact that the COVID-19 trials are still ongoing, referring viewers to the U.S. government\u2019s clinical trial registration page for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which says the completion date for the trial is nearly two years away, on Jan. 31, 2023.", "That\u2019s true, but misleading. The trial won\u2019t technically end until it follows participants for two years, but that neglects the reality that the main trial results are already available and have demonstrated the vaccine\u2019s basic safety and efficacy in tens of thousands of individuals.", "Based on that phase 3 trial information, which is publicly available and has been reviewed by multiple panels of experts, the U.S. and U.K. governments concluded the benefits outweigh the potential risks and decided to authorize the vaccine for emergency use. People getting the vaccines now are not trial participants.", "Coleman also suggests that the U.K. government\u2019s efforts to monitor people who are vaccinated is somehow suspicious.", "\u201cThey advertise for special software so that they could keep track of the high number of adverse events they were expecting \u2014 for two years,\u201d he says.", "That, too, is misleading. The government is not necessarily expecting adverse events, but does want to be able to detect them if they occur. This is standard practice after the release of a new vaccine and the U.S. has similar efforts underway.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, these vaccine safety monitoring systems are important because while large phase 3 trials can show that there are no common safety concerns, rare events might only be observed once the vaccine is given to millions of people.", "A prevailing theme throughout Coleman\u2019s video is the baseless idea that the available COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to large numbers of people.", "\u201cThousands of people who\u2019ve had the vaccine have died or been seriously injured by it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s an undeniable fact. Elderly people in care homes are dying in huge numbers. We\u2019re told it\u2019s the infection, but it\u2019s not, of course, it\u2019s the damned vaccine they\u2019re being given.\u201d", "Coleman later claims there is a \u201chorrifying avalanche of evidence showing that these damned vaccines are killing and maiming people\u201d and says, \u201cThis is genocide.\u201d", "As his supposed proof, Coleman rattles off headlines from dubious websites proclaiming that people have died, without mentioning that the deaths have not been shown to be caused by the vaccine \u2014 and very likely are completely coincidental.", "For example, Coleman cites an article from Health Impact News, a website known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, that misleadingly claims \u201c181 Dead in the U.S. During 2 Week Period From Experimental COVID Injections.\u201d The number comes from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which as we\u2019ve written before, does not imply that the vaccine was necessarily responsible. Anyone can report through an online form and there is no vetting of the report.", "In another case, Coleman reads off a headline from another vaccine misinformation website about a man and woman in South Dakota dying a day after getting a vaccine. But he doesn\u2019t mention that the state\u2019s department of health concluded that immunization didn\u2019t contribute to those deaths.", "There is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale. While many people have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, serious side effects are uncommon.", "A review of the vaccine safety monitoring data in the U.K. through the end of January found that the \u201coverall safety experience\u201d with the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines \u201cis so far as expected from the clinical trials,\u201d with the expected benefits \u201cfar outweigh[ing] any currently known side effects.\u201d", "According to the report, severe allergic reactions occurred in a small number of people, but these are very rare and have not resulted in death.", "In the U.S., the vaccine safety monitoring data also is very encouraging. Dr. Paul Offit said in a Feb. 11 interview with JAMA that a recent review by the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had not revealed any safety signals from the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines.", "One potential issue raised by the trials was that the vaccines might very occasionally trigger a usually temporary form of facial paralysis known as Bell\u2019s Palsy. But so far, Offit said, there\u2019s no sign that the condition is any more likely in people who get vaccinated. Data from the U.K. also support that finding.", "According to a paper the CDC published in JAMA Insights, cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, following the vaccines in the U.S. are also very unusual\u00a0 \u2014 2.5 cases per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as of Jan. 18.", "Officials in the U.S. are investigating a few instances of thrombocytopenia, or a lack of blood-clotting platelets, following vaccination, including one death. But it is still unknown whether that type of reaction can be due to COVID-19 vaccination. Even if it is, it would be an extremely rare event and experts say it would pose less risk than the chance of getting COVID-19 and suffering severe health consequences.", "Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says \u201cwomen younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.\u201d As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see \u201cQ&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.\u201d", "It\u2019s true, of course, that people have died after receiving a vaccine \u2014 but this doesn\u2019t mean the vaccine is to blame for the deaths. Every day, around 8,000 people in the U.S. die from a variety of causes. And as the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s department of medicine chair Dr. Robert Wachter has pointed out, if 10 million people are vaccinated, in the following two months you\u2019d expect 4,025 of those people to have a heart attack, 3,975 to have a stroke and 14,000 to die. \u201cAnd the vaccines will have zero to do with any of them,\u201d he wrote.", "\u201cThere are always going to be these temporal associations, and you read about them in the newspaper,\u201d said Offit. \u201cBut at least right now, those temporal associations have not been found to be causal associations.\u201d", "This is especially the case when vaccines are being given to older people who may not be in good health.", "\u201cOlder age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions of people vaccinated,\u201d the U.K.\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency explains in its report. \u201cIt is therefore important that we carefully review these reports to distinguish possible side effects from illness that would have occurred irrespective of vaccination.\u201d", "Throughout the video, Coleman makes a series of other false claims, including the long-debunked notion that COVID-19 \u201chas been proved to be no more dangerous than the annual flu.\u201d That\u2019s wrong.", "While scientists are still trying to pin down how deadly COVID-19 is, studies estimate that between 0.5% and 1.0% of people who are infected with the coronavirus will die \u2014 much more than influenza\u2019s usually well below 0.1% mortality rate, as we\u2019ve written.", "And the sheer number of deaths from COVID-19 far outstrip those for influenza. As of Feb. 11, more than 470,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the CDC. That\u2019s more than the estimated number of flu deaths from the past 10 flu seasons combined \u2014 and more than 20 times the number of deaths estimated to have occurred during the 2019-2020 flu season.", "Coleman also cites statements from the World Health Organization to undermine and distort the facts on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.", "\u201cThe fact is that even the World Health Organization only expects these vaccines to help reduce the extent of the symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not promising that the vaccine will stop people getting COVID-19 and they\u2019re not expecting the vaccine to stop people spreading the infection if they do get it.\u201d", "No one can promise that a vaccine will prevent disease in all people, as no vaccine is 100% effective. But data from the trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, for example, found that vaccinated people were 94% or 95% less likely to develop symptoms of COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated.", "It\u2019s true that the vaccines may not prevent infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as the trials were primarily designed to show that the vaccines kept people from falling ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.)", "But it\u2019s incorrect to say that the WHO is not expecting the vaccines to do anything for transmission. On webpages dedicated to the Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines, the agency simply says that there isn\u2019t data or that it\u2019s not known yet if vaccination will protect against onward transmission. The WHO has also said the same more broadly in press briefings.", "In fact, many scientists do expect COVID-19 vaccines to keep people from spreading the virus to at least some degree. That\u2019s because it\u2019s likely an infected but mildly ill or asymptomatic person would shed less virus and therefore be less contagious than a sicker unvaccinated person. But because this has not been demonstrated or known to what degree viral spread might be halted, public health officials have been upfront that it\u2019s possible the vaccines may only prevent disease.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
