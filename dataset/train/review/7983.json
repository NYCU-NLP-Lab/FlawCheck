["By D'Angelo Gore and Robert Farley", "Posted on December 4, 2020", "A TV ad from a Republican group accuses the Democratic candidates in Georgia\u2019s two Senate runoff elections of having \u201cradically dangerous\u201d ideas on the criminal justice system and the environment. But there\u2019s more to their positions than what the ad suggests.", "The ad was released Dec. 2 by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is supporting Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the upcoming Jan. 5 elections. Warnock is challenging Loeffler for her seat, and Ossoff is going up against Perdue for his.", "The outcome of the elections will determine which political party controls the Senate.", "The ad claims Warnock is \u201cradically dangerous\u201d because he \u201csupports cashless bail for criminals. That puts the most violent right back into our neighborhoods.\u201d But that\u2019s misleading.", "It\u2019s true that Warnock has been critical of the cash bail system, which requires individuals charged with committing crimes to pay a fee in order to leave jail while their case works its way through the court system. If the person cannot afford to pay the bail amount set by a judge, they are often detained until their case is resolved.", "Warnock has argued that cash bail laws contribute to the mass incarceration of poor people, who may not even go on to be convicted. However, his campaign told us he doesn\u2019t support a complete ban on cash bail.", "\u201cReverend Warnock supports ending cash bail for nonviolent misdemeanor offenders, not an all out ban on cash bail as this suggests,\u201d the campaign emphasized in an email.", "In 2018, for example, Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, supported an ordinance approved by the Atlanta City Council that eliminated the requirement for individuals charged with committing certain low-level crimes to pay a cash bond to secure their pretrial release from custody. In a press release, the office of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who signed the ordinance into law, explained that the measure \u201cmaintains the ability to impose bail and other conditions for certain offenders including violent offenders, repeat offenders, and offenders who fail to appear for their initial hearing.\u201d", "During the public comments portion of a February 2018 meeting of the Atlanta City Council, Warnock spoke in favor of the ordinance (at 1:38:35 in the video).", "\u201cA letter went out to the council members from an attorney representing the bondsman association reminding them that this [cash bail] system is as old as the country, as if that supports the rightness of the situation,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cSlavery is as old as this country, and it is as wrong as it is old. And so I stand to say that we ought to support this new ordinance. We ought to end money bail. We ought to end wealth-based detention.\u201d", "To support the ad\u2019s claim about Warnock, the NRSC pointed to those remarks, as well as a tweet Warnock sent in October that said: \u201cNo one should be stuck in jail just because they can\u2019t afford cash bail. Poverty is not a crime, we must end cash bail.\u201d", "But while Warnock did say \u201cend money\u201d or \u201ccash bail,\u201d his campaign has clarified that his support for changing cash bail requirements is more limited than a full on ban. He specifically supports ending the practice for those accused of nonviolent crimes.", "Making its case that Ossoff is a \u201cradical liberal,\u201d the NRSC ad misleadingly says Ossoff \u201cpraised\u201d the Green New Deal. Ossoff praised one of the main ideas in the Green New Deal \u2014 \u201clinking environmental policy and infrastructure policy\u201d \u2014 but he has said that he does not support the resolution.", "According to the NRSC ad\u2019s narrator, \u201cOssoff praised radical socialist AOC\u2019s Green New Deal, a radically bad deal for Georgia families. It\u2019d kill local jobs, astronomically raise Georgia taxes.\u201d", "Ossoff has repeatedly said that he does not support the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House and by Sen. Ed Markey in the Senate.", "In the \u201cspeed round\u201d portion of a November \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d interview about policies, Ossoff was asked directly, \u201cDo you support the Green New Deal?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Ossoff replied succinctly. Ossoff also answered \u201cno\u201d indicating that he did not support Medicare for All, defunding police, abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or expanding the Supreme Court.", "In an interview in August, Ossoff pushed back against a different ad from the NRSC during the general election that similarly accused him of praising the Green New Deal.", "\u201cThey\u2019re claiming that I support the Green New Deal. I do not,\u201d Ossoff told the Gwinnett Daily Post.", "The NRSC points to comments Ossoff made to the New York Times in September 2019: \u201cNow on the Green New Deal, I commend Senator Edward Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for linking environmental policy and infrastructure policy. However, do I believe that the critical path to fighting climate change requires the abolition of the private health insurance market? No, I do not. And I\u2019ll debate that all day, while still recognizing the value and honoring the political contribution of folks who maybe see it a little bit differently.\u201d", "The resolutions introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey talk about \u201cproviding all people of the United States with \u2026 high-quality health care.\u201d Although the resolutions do not mention how that would be achieved, some have taken that to mean Medicare for All, which both Markey and Ocasio-Cortez support.", "Ossoff, however, does not support Medicare for All. Like Biden, Ossoff supports a public health insurance option as a choice, while maintaining private insurance for those who want to keep it.", "Ossoff\u2019s energy plan does, however, mirror some of the environmental goals of the Green New Deal.", "\u201cWe can meet our energy needs without destroying the environment \u2014 but only by rapidly transitioning to clean energy sources, dramatically reducing carbon emissions, and increasing energy efficiency,\u201d Ossoff states on the policy page of his campaign website. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll support a historic infrastructure plan that includes massive investments in clean energy, energy efficiency, and environmental protection.\u201d", "The Green New Deal also talks about dramatically decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and investing \u201cin the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st century.\u201d", "In addition to its environmental agenda, the Green New Deal lays out priorities such as creating high-paying jobs and protecting vulnerable communities. Some Republicans have criticized those provisions \u2014 Perdue, for example, called the Green New Deal a \u201csocialist wish list.\u201d Some Republican backlash referred to documents Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff released but later described as early drafts and removed from her website. President Donald Trump, for example, suggested on Feb. 9 in a tweet that the plan would \u201cpermanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military.\u201d But as we have written, the Green New Deal doesn\u2019t call for any of these prohibitions.", "It\u2019s misleading to claim Ossoff \u201cpraised\u201d a plan when he applauded one aspect of it but made clear he\u2019s against the full proposal.", "As for the cost of the Green New Deal \u2014 the NRSC ad says it would \u201castronomically raise Georgia taxes\u201d \u2014 some conservative and libertarian think tanks have attached a high cost to taxpayers to implement the Green New Deal. But experts have told us the Green New Deal is too vague at this point to estimate its cost.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
