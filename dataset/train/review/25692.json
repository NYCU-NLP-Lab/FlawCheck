["As the primary election for an open Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat approached, most TV ads were aired by Tommy Thompson and the three candidates he defeated for the Republican nomination.\n\nBut U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, who won the Democratic nomination without opposition, didn\u2019t sit out completely.\n\nEyeing the fall campaign, Baldwin released an ad July 30, 2012 that, she said, highlights her efforts to strengthen Wisconsin manufacturing.\n\n\"Coast Guard cutters: built in America, but powered by engines manufactured overseas, even though you can\u2019t buy a better engine than the ones made right here in Wisconsin,\" Baldwin declared.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a message on the screen said: \"Tammy Baldwin sponsored BUY American bill.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t recall any major political battles over Coast Guard engines during Baldwin\u2019s nearly 14 years in Congress.\n\nBut by saying \"I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy\" Wisconsin-made engines, Baldwin suggests she was successful in her fight and that such a requirement is in place. Moreover, the \"sponsored a buy American bill\" message suggests the fight she led affected more than just Wisconsin manufacturers.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happened.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s engine amendments\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any news stories in the Nexis database about any congressional battles over Coast Guard engines, but Baldwin did introduce amendments on the matter three different times.\n\nBaldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited those amendments as evidence to back her claim.\n\nJune 2003: The amendment would have prohibited buying new Coast Guard cutters unless their engines were made in the United States \"by a domestically operated entity.\"\n\nKraus said that would have ruled out engines provided by Detroit Diesel, which was owned by German-based Daimler-Chrysler, \"leaving only one possible source for diesel engines: Wisconsin-based Fairbanks Morse.\"\n\nFairbanks Morse Engine is in Beloit, in Baldwin\u2019s district.\n\nSo, Baldwin\u2019s first amendment focused on getting more business for one Wisconsin company, not American manufacturers generally.\n\nNo vote was taken on Baldwin\u2019s amendment, a Library of Congress record shows. It was ruled out of order because it proposed \"to change existing law and constituted legislation in an appropriations bill.\"\n\nNovember 2003: Baldwin introduced a slightly different amendment. It would have required that engines purchased for the Coast Guard\u2019s new fleet of ships be made in America, according to a transcript of House proceedings.\n\nKraus pointed out that this amendment didn\u2019t prohibit engines being made in the U.S. by a foreign-operated company.\n.\n(Interestingly, we found that Baldwin introduced this amendment with U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R.-Wis., the running mate of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan argued that many defense contracts had made-in-America requirements, which he said help national security by ensuring that needed goods are available in the U.S.)\n\nThe amendment was rejected on a voice vote.\n\nJune 2011: Baldwin\u2019s third amendment used language similar to the first. And like the first amendment, it was ruled out of order and didn\u2019t come up for a vote.\n\nWe asked Kraus about the message on the screen in the ad -- which said Baldwin sponsored a \"BUY American bill\" -- since that sounded like it might be a separate legislation, not merely an amendment. There have been various bills requiring the purchase of American-made goods over the years.\n\nBut Kraus said the message on the screen was merely another reference to the three amendments that Baldwin introduced.\n\nOur rating\n\nBaldwin said: \"I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies.\"\n\nAlthough there isn\u2019t evidence of much of a fight, her statement contains an element of truth in that she introduced three amendments aimed at benefiting a Wisconsin manufacturer. But the ad is misleading in suggesting that her fight was successful, when none of the measures she introduced became law. What\u2019s more, it suggests it was part of a broader \"Buy American\" push, not measures aimed at helping a company in her district.\n\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "Tammy Baldwin campaign, TV ad, July 30, 2012\n\nTammy Baldwin campaign, TV ad news release, July 30, 2012\n\nInterview and e-mail interview, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus, Aug. 13 and 15, 2012\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office, Admiral Thomas Collins Senate subcommittee testimony, March 17, 2012\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office, transcript of House discussion of Tammy Baldwin bill amendment (page 5783), June 24, 2003\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office, transcript of House discussion of Tammy Baldwin bill amendment (page 10421), Nov. 5, 2003\n\nLibrary of Congress, Tammy Baldwin June 2003 bill amendment history\n\nLibrary of Congress, Tammy Baldwin June 2011 bill amendment history\n\nCongressional Research Service, \"Domestic content legislation: The Buy American Act and complementary little buy American provisions,\" April 25, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
