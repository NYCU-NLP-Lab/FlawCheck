Employers, she said, tell her they cannot find an employee to fill a position because applicants can\u2019t pass a drug test, while military recruiters say they have to turn away otherwise exceptional recruits because of drug use.", "Hartzler talked about her years teaching at-risk teenagers and cited a widespread drug problem in the United States and one of its most sobering effects: the displacement of children into foster care.", "\"Twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs,\" Hartzler said.", "Certainly drug use by parents can lead to state intervention, but is the number of reported cases really this high?", "Foster care", "According to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, there are 397,122 children living in the foster system without permanent families.", "Hartzler has long been an advocate for the advancement of foster care, even co-publishing an article on its problems.", "Kyle Buckles, Hartzler\u2019s communications director, pointed us toward the Green Book.", "Each year, statistics are compiled into the House of Representative\u2019s Green Book, which is used to provide background material and data on the programs run by the Ways and Means Committee, including foster care.", "Foster care statistics", "Without considering alcohol, drug use by the parent was above 25 percent from 2010 through 2013, for which data is available.

For example, a child may be removed from his parents\u2019 custody for neglect, parental drug abuse and child drug abuse.", "The problem appears to be getting worse. A 2009 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that between the years 2002 and 2007, 12 percent of children between the ages of six to 11 were living with a parent who abused drugs or alcohol.", "Take Back the District", "Hartzler\u2019s initiative has since met once to discuss the district\u2019s drug issues.", "Her goal was to bring together law enforcement, parents, school officials, community leaders and citizens.", "The program met early on Oct. 19, where Hartzler, speakers and guests discussed the issuesand possible solutions to the problem and then diverted to a \"Faith-Based Rehabilitation and Ministry\" panel discussion.", "Our ruling", "Hartzler claimed that a quarter of children in foster care were there because of their parent\u2019s drug abuse.", "Her claim is a modest estimation of the issue, according to reliable data kept by Congress.
