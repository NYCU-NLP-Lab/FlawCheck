["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage knows what his critics will say during his re-election campaign: he's been in charge too long.\n\nBut Bollwage, a Democrat whose fifth term ends this year, has a few reasons voters should keep him in office.\n\n\"And we're moving in the right direction, the city of Elizabeth. We've done a lot of big things, with Ikea, Jersey Gardens, and we have opportunities here in our community. Our jobless rate, our unemployment rate, is the lowest of \u00a0all of the big cities in New Jersey,\" Bollwage said during a Jan. 15 speech at the Cuban Club, drawing applause from his audience. \"That's a great testament to our community.\"\n\nYou may want to hold back your applause, though, because the mayor is wrong.\n\nA reader asked PolitiFact New Jersey to check out Bollwage\u2019s claim. We found Elizabeth\u2019s unemployment rate stands at 11.9 percent, according to the most recent data available from the state\u2019s Labor Department. Newark\u2019s and Paterson\u2019s jobless rates are bleaker, \u00a0at 14.1 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively.\n\nBut Jersey City -- the second most populous city in the state behind Newark -- has an unemployment rate of 10.2 percent.\n\nSo, among that group of cities with a population of more than 100,000, Elizabeth is third, not last.\n\nCity spokesman William Reyes said Bollwage meant to say Elizabeth has one of the lowest, not the lowest, unemployment rates among New Jersey\u2019s most populous cities.\n\nIn his State of the City address, which Bollwage delivered before he gave the speech at the Cuban Club, the mayor got it right: \"Our unemployment rate is among the lowest of New Jersey\u2019s largest cities and we are looking to reduce that even more.\" A chart Reyes sent us that was shown during the mayor\u2019s address compared the unemployment rates in Elizabeth, Trenton, Newark, Paterson and Camden.\n\nOf those cities, Camden has the highest unemployment rate, at 18.8 percent, and Elizabeth had the lowest, at 11.9 percent.
