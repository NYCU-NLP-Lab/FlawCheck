["An error-laden Instagram post touts two dozen music artists who are joining Stevie Wonder's boycott of Florida.", "Did you hear?", "Dozens of the world\u2019s hottest musical acts are joining music legend Stevie Wonder\u00a0in protest of Florida\u2019s \"stand your ground\" law after the George Zimmerman trial, according to social networks and the blogosphere.", "Memes\u00a0zooming through social media name two dozen artists that have canceled their tour dates in the Sunshine State indefinitely \"UNTIL THE LAW IN FLORIDA IS ABOLISHED!\" The list is populated with world-famous acts such as Justin Timberlake, Jay Z, Rihanna, Rod Stewart, Patti LaBelle, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Alicia Keys, Usher, will.i.am, R. Kelly, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Ciara, Kelly Rowland and other groups.", "Timberlake is singled out for nixing the kickoff of his tour in Miami because he refused \"TO ENTERTAIN A STATE WHO\u2019S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHOOT-N-KILL UN-ARMED TEENAGERS!\"", "The PSA first caught PolitiFact Florida\u2019s eye when it was shared in Instagram. Then the list got more attention when versions of it trickled into mainstream coverage.", "We\u00a0are skeptical of chain emails and the like that are typed in ALL CAPS, contain misspellings and do not disclose their sources. The meme we\u2019ve seen (which touts the misspelled names of RIHANA and ALISHIA KEYS as signing on) is a triple whammy.", "We decided to investigate whether dozens of high-profile acts are really joining Wonder and boycotting Florida. Our synopsis: Just because it\u2019s in the news does not make it true.", "Adding names to Stevie Wonder's boycott", "Talk of Florida boycotts started July 14, the day after Zimmerman\u2019s \"not guilty\" verdict in the death of Trayvon Martin. Wonder announced\u00a0then in Quebec City that he will never again perform in Florida until the 2005 \"stand your ground\" law is abolished.", "He took it a step further: \"As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.\" (More than 20 other states have similar \"stand your ground\" laws.)", "Several musical artists\u00a0and celebrities reacted to the verdict with\u00a0anger\u00a0and\u00a0disbelief. Many gave musical tributes to Martin, including Beyonc\u00e9, Young Jeezy, Jay Z and Justin Timberlake, Patti LaBelle, Bruce Springsteen, and Wyclef Jean.", "But none of the artists on the Instagram list -- even those who have spoken out against the verdict -- publicly announced they are joining Wonder\u2019s boycott. We checked social media accounts, websites and news reports and found no declarations of support for the boycott from the people on the list.", "Still, it wasn\u2019t long before the story crossed over into news coverage. American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan cited \"sources close to Stevie Wonder camp\" for her July 22 report\u00a0that claimed a similar slate of artists are joining him in support of changing \"stand your ground.\" Some have already called off concerts, she wrote.", "Her AURN report was picked up by congressional newspaper The Hill\u00a0and the Huffington Post\u00a0on July 22, read and shared by thousands. The next day, even more newspapers picked it up but tried to add a little more caution (including the Tampa Bay Times).", "Ryan\u2019s list contained two groups that were not on the Instagram roundup: Eddie Levert, lead singer of the R&B group The O\u2019Jays, and gospel duo Mary Mary", "\"We love our fans but we MUST do something!!\" Mary Mary wrote on Facebook. \"We understand a No from us isn\u2019t as big as a No from Stevie Wonder but if all our voices join together we can REALLY change things!\"", "These are the only artists from Ryan\u2019s list of 23 artists who have announced they are joining Wonder\u2019s effort.", "Ryan has since updated her post with a disclaimer: I obtained from multiple sources early Monday a list of artists and entertainers who my sources told me had committed to a boycott of Florida following the George Zimmerman acquittal. Since publishing that list I have heard from several representatives of the artists named who say, on behalf of their clients, they are uncomfortable being identified on that list and are seeking additional information.", "The Huffington Post, hearing from artists' reps that the list was not true (but not willing to go on the record), later wrote a story discrediting its original post.", "The shows still go on", "We did our own reporting. Most\u00a0of the artists do not have upcoming tour dates in Florida. Rihanna, for example, was just in Tampa in April. Madonna is not on tour.", "\"This leg of Rod Stewart's tour hasn't ever included Florida dates so that isn't accurate,\" said Hannah Kampf, a spokeswoman for Stewart.", "Madonna did not join the boycott, spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg told us. Neither did Alicia Keys, whose spokeswoman said in a statement, \"We question the validity of this list since Alicia's name along with many others has appeared erroneously.\"", "A spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones told Mother Jones\u00a0no one in the band had \"heard\u00a0anything about this.\"", "Timberlake and Jay Z do have their shared \"Legends of the Summer\" concert\u00a0on Aug. 16 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Timberlake has another concert planned for December in Orlando.", "If the show is off, no one told the ticket vendors, updated either artist\u2019s website or informed the venues. Sun Life Stadium tweeted us\u00a0that the concert \"is on as scheduled.\"", "Funk maestro George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, also named among artists boycotting Florida, is scheduled to play in Tallahassee\u00a0on July 28. We found nothing to contradict that. And funk stars Maze and Frankie Beverly are still slated to perform at the Mahaffey Theater\u00a0in St. Petersburg on Sept. 15, a spokeswoman confirmed to tbt*, a daily tabloid published by the Tampa Bay Times.", "Our ruling", "The Internet is rife with claims of Stevie Wonder\u2019s beefed-up Florida boycott. It\u2019s short on proof.", "Most of the stars identified in social media lists may have spoken out against the verdict or in support of Trayvon, but we haven\u2019t seen them go the extra mile and call off shows until the \"stand your ground\" law is abolished. With the exception of two smaller acts that aren\u2019t included in some iterations of the meme, we could not find evidence to back up the notion that scores of acts are joining up with Wonder's boycott.", "We rate this statement False.", "We updated this check after publishing with comments from representatives for Madonna and Alicia Keys.", "Snopes, \"Music artists boycotting Florida?\" July 21, 2013", "ABC News, \"Stevie Wonder boycotts Florida,\" July 17, 2013", "Instagram, post\u00a0from Keshia Knight Pulliam, July 21, 2013", "E!
