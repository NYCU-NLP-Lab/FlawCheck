["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Politics, step aside. The Truth-O-Meter must address a matter of Southern pride.\n\nThe honor and reputation of our local groundhog General Beauregard Lee.\n\nFor three decades, the South\u2019s most esteemed weather prognosticator has lived in the stout and lumpy shadow of Punxsutawney Phil. \u00a0\n\nPhil makes the rounds yearly on the morning talk shows. He\u2019s made appearances with Oprah Winfrey and President Ronald Reagan. His agent even scored him a gig with Bill Murray in the 1993 movie \"Groundhog Day.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, PolitiFact Georgia scribes rolled our eyes as the public fawned over Phil once again during Wednesday\u2019s annual Groundhog Day celebration. Phil never saw his shadow, news accounts said. Spring will come early.\n\nBut should you really trust Phil? Beau\u2019s website says our metro Atlanta celebrity is accurate 94 percent of the time. Phil\u2019s record is a measly 85 percent, it said. That stat has been picked up by various news outlets. \u00a0\n\nDoes Beau really deserve second place to that Yankee glory hog?\n\nPolitiFact Georgia decided to settle this matter once and for all.\n\nFor the scoop on Beau\u2019s record, we talked to Art Rilling, CEO and founder of Lilburn\u2019s Yellow River Game Ranch, an attraction featuring people-friendly wildlife northeast of Atlanta. Beau lives there in a plantation-style manse named \"Weathering Heights.\" For the past 10 years, his staff has calculated the General\u2019s accuracy by noting the number of days local temperatures hit the freezing mark during the six weeks after Feb. 2.\n\nBeau, like Phil, predicted an early spring for 2011.\n\nSadly, Phil\u2019s staff has not tracked their groundhog\u2019s predictions so diligently. Their official stance is that their marmot is \"incapable of error, so his accuracy rate is 100 percent,\" said Mike Johnston, vice president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. \u00a0\n\nWednesday was Punxsutawney\u2019s 125th groundhog celebration. German settlers brought the tradition, which is based on ancient myths that say hedgehogs, which resemble groundhogs, have the power to predict the weather.\n\nPhil\u2019s predictions are not site-specific. If he says that spring will come early, it will, Johnston said. Somewhere.\n\nWhen Phil\u2019s really wrong, Johnston added, it\u2019s the fault of poor Groundhogeese-to-English translation.\n\n\"People complain and tell us we\u2019re just making it up as we go along,\" Johnston said, \"but after 125 years of doing it, we don\u2019t need to.\"\n\nBefore we go further, the staff of PolitiFact Georgia feels obliged to mention that meteorologists have officially determined that groundhogs cannot predict the weather.\n\nReally. A tongue-in-cheek analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Climatic Data Center concluded groundhogs show \"no predictive skill.\" (Why do this? To help get kids interested in the science of weather.)\n\nOr, more bluntly, \"you can\u2019t take any stock in a groundhog predicting the weather,\" said Tom Ross, a meteorologist who helped put together the NCDC\u2019s report. \u00a0It showed that between 1988 and 2010, Phil gave accurate national weather predictions 10 times out of 23 for a rate of 43 percent.\n\nTrue, but that won\u2019t stop us. Our groundhog\u2019s honor is at stake.\n\nSince the keepers of Beau and Phil do not keep comparable statistics, we performed an independent analysis using the NCDC study and National Weather Service data for 2001 through 2010.\n\nWe defined \"early spring\" as a February with above-average temperatures. We then compared each groundhog\u2019s prediction with temperatures nationally and in his respective hometown.\n\nThe NWS does not keep average February temperatures for the hamlet of Punxsutawney, Pa., so a kindly meteorologist gave us figures for Putneyville, Pa., a town at a similar elevation about 15 miles away.\n\nWe found that the General predicted whether spring will start early nationally with 60 percent accuracy. Phil\u2019s rate was 30 percent.\n\nBeau predicted Atlanta weather with 50 percent accuracy. Phil got Punxsutawney\u2019s right 40 percent of the time.\n\nBy our analysis, Beau\u2019s staff overestimated his success, but he\u2019s still 10 to 30 percentage points ahead of Phil. Georgia\u2019s underhog is the champion, paws down. \u00a0\n\nGeneral, emerge from the shadows.
