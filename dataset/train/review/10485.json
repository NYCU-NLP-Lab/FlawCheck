["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on May 20, 2016", "Hillary Clinton claimed\u00a0that she \u201cread\u201d that Donald Trump \u201csaid he wants to \u2026 abolish the VA.\u201d That\u2019s the opposite of what Trump has said.", "Clinton got her information from a Wall Street Journal article that said Trump\u2019s campaign co-chair and chief policy adviser indicated that \u201cthe presumptive GOP presidential nominee would likely push VA health care toward privatization and might move for it to become more of an insurance provider like Medicare rather than an integrated hospital system.\u201d", "Does that mean that Trump wants to end the program that provides health care to nearly 9 million U.S. veterans?", "The article quoted the same\u00a0policy adviser as saying that \u201cthere are a lot of VA facilities that are being run very well\u201d and that Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to take away the veterans hospitals and the things that are working well.\u201d", "Plus, in late October, during a campaign rally in Norfolk, Virginia, Trump told a crowd of\u00a0supporters that he wanted to \u201ctransform\u201d and \u201cmodernize\u201d the Department of Veterans Affairs to \u201cmake it great again.\u201d Contrary to what Clinton claimed, Trump told his audience, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get rid of it.\u201d", "Clinton talked about Trump wanting to \u201cabolish the VA\u201d during a May 16 campaign rally in Kentucky. She said she read, but didn\u2019t verify, that that was Trump\u2019s intention.", "Clinton, May 16: He has all of this loose cannon kind of talk about foreign policy and national security. He also \u2026 I read this. I really shouldn\u2019t say it. I should verify it, but I read it. He has said he wants to, you know, abolish the VA. Now, we can improve the VA and I will be sure to improve the VA. I will have somebody reporting to me every week in the Oval Office about what improvements we\u2019re making in the VA. But abolishing the VA? Privatizing the VA?", "Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin told us that Clinton\u2019s claim was based on a May 12 Wall Street Journal article that said that Trump would \u201clikely push VA health care toward privatization\u201d and \u201cmight move\u201d to make the system more like Medicare.", "Wall Street Journal, May 12: Donald Trump says the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 health-care system is badly broken, and this week his campaign released some guidelines that would steer changes he would implement if he wins the presidency.", "While short on details, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would likely push VA health care toward privatization and might move for it to become more of an insurance provider like Medicare rather than an integrated hospital system, said Sam Clovis, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief policy adviser, in an interview.", "\u201cWe want quality care top to bottom,\u201d Mr. Clovis said in an interview. \u201cIf that means we have some form of privatization or some form of Medicare, we don\u2019t see anything wrong with that.\u201d", "Mr. Clovis, who is also Mr. Trump\u2019s national campaign co-chair, said the candidate\u2019s priority would be to give veterans timely health care close to home.", "That could mean restructuring the system in a way to more resemble an insurance provider along the lines of the popular Tricare system used by 9.6 million members of the Department of Defense, where civilian facilities routinely augment department-run hospitals.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly look at that model, we want to make it as comprehensive as possible,\u201d said Mr. Clovis when asked about Tricare. \u201cThe VA\u2019s a broken system now. We can\u2019t continue down that road.\u201d", "Clinton also\u00a0wants to improve the VA, but she opposes efforts to privatize its health care system, according to her campaign website.", "In August, when then Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson suggested eliminating the VA health system and giving veterans health savings accounts to purchase private insurance, the heads of eight veterans organizations wrote him an open letter telling him that his proposal \u201cwould inevitably endanger the health and well-being of millions of wounded, injured and ill veterans, an outcome that we cannot allow to occur.\u201d", "It\u2019s not clear exactly what Trump would\u00a0do to change the VA, but he hasn\u2019t suggested it be completely eliminated.", "The Journal reported that Clovis said the Trump campaign would be fine with privatizing the VA health system, which could mean giving veterans vouchers to purchase private health insurance. Another option the paper said Clovis discussed\u00a0was making the VA health system\u00a0more like the Medicare program for seniors or the TRICARE program for military service members and personnel.", "But the Journal\u00a0also said that Clovis declined to provide specifics, and the paper quoted the policy adviser saying that Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to take away the veterans hospitals and the things that are working well.\u201d", "We also read \u201cThe Goals Of Donald J. Trump\u2019s Veterans Plan,\u201d which his\u00a0campaign posted online after the rally in Norfolk last year. It doesn\u2019t say Trump wants to abolish the VA.", "\u201cThe guiding principle of the Trump plan is ensuring veterans have convenient access to the best quality care,\u201d the plan reads.", "\u201cTo further this principle, the Trump plan will decrease wait times, improve healthcare outcomes, and facilitate a seamless transition from service into civilian life.\u201d", "The plan includes three key initiatives:", "1. Ensure our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. No more long drives. No more waiting for backlogs. No more excessive red tape. Just the care and support they earned with their service to our country.", "2. Support the whole veteran, not just their physical health care, but also by addressing their invisible wounds, investing in our service members\u2019 post-active duty success, transforming the VA to meet the needs of 21st century service members, and better meeting the needs of our female veterans.", "3. Make the VA great again by firing the corrupt and incompetent VA executives who let our veterans down, by modernizing the VA, and by empowering the doctors and nurses to ensure our veterans receive the best care available in a timely manner.", "One of the biggest changes that\u00a0plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.", "\u201cUnder a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\u2019s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,\u201d the plan states.", "\u201cThe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\u2019 healthcare dollars,\u201d the plan says.", "Trump\u2019s published proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the Veterans Health Administration under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers\u00a0cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.", "That proposal would also go further than the Veterans Choice Act, which, in 2014, created a\u00a0temporary program, separate from the\u00a0Non-VA Medical Care Program, that\u00a0allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.", "Although a big part of the plan that Trump unveiled last year\u00a0involves expanding veterans\u2019 access to health care outside of the VA, he has said that he thinks that the health system is still necessary.", "\u201cThe VA health care system is a total disaster, nothing short of a disaster,\u201d Trump said in his speech in Norfolk. \u201cSome candidates want to get rid of it. But the veterans need the VA to be there for them and their families. I don\u2019t want to get rid of it. I want to supplement it.\u201d", "The plan posted on the Trump campaign\u2019s website makes the same point.", "So, does Trump want to \u201cabolish the VA,\u201d as Clinton said?", "We don\u2019t know for certain how Trump plans to transform the system. At this point, all we have to go on is what Trump has said\u00a0he would do, and what his policy adviser says he might do. But neither man said that Trump wants to \u201cabolish the VA.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/06bdf813-3ba1-4cbe-a7a1-fea696b02440", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
