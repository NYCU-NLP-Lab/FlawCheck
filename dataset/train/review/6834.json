The 83 year old man was identified as Dr. Winston Corrigan, a chemistry professor from the University of Minnesota who went missing in the fall of 1984 and was a previous resident of the home.", "There was no truth to the story, however. IFLScience.org was a fake news site that traded on its deliberate similarity to the popular science-based IFLScience.com site to spread fabricated clickbait stories. IFLScience.org used the same layout as the real IFLScience.com site, a form of camouflage that frequently tricked readers into believing that they were reading authentic news stories.", "However, the two sites had several noticeable differences:", "The photograph of \"chemistry professor Dr. Winston Corrigan\" used to accompany the fake article is actually a (color-altered) picture of Gary Sandford Raub, a Seattle transient who was arrested in 2012 for the 1976 stabbing death of a 70-year-old woman in Augusta, the oldest cold case arrest in Maine history:", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
