During his appearance on MSNBC, Biden called on the Senate-controlled National Archives to search for and publicly release any such complaint, and said that\u2019s the only place it could be.", "The University of Delaware, meanwhile, maintains a sealed collection of more than 1,850 boxes of Biden\u2019s papers that span his 36-year career in the Senate.

He said the collection is of \"personal papers,\" such as speeches, policy positions, overseas interviews, and other official actions.

They\u2019re papers or position papers. They are documents that existed and that \u2014 when I met, for example, when I met with Putin or when I met with whomever, and all of that could be fodder in a campaign at this time. I don\u2019t know of anybody who\u2019s done anything like that. And so the National Archives is the only place there would be anything having to do with personnel records.
