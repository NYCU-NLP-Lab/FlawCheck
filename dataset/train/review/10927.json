["\u201cBreastfeed milk with BLOOD and PUS. This is what they sell you. This is what you drink,\u201d warns one Facebook post\u00a0that was shared more than 45,000 times since it was published in 2016. Its author, vegan YouTuber Sonia Sae, also invites internet users to consider that \u201cany plant based milk will be healthier and more ethical than cow's breastfeed milk.\u201d", "More recently, Sae's post gained a new virality in Spanish-speaking corners of the internet.", "The photo in Sae's post is a screenshot of a video posted in December 2013 by a dairy farmer from Gloucestershire, in England.", "At the beginning of the video, a man with a British accent can be heard explaining\u00a0that he is about to milk three cows ready to give milk for the first time after giving birth. According to the narrator, the cows have been separated from the rest of the herd\u00a0because in the days following calving, they secrete a liquid called colostrum that is thick and creamy,\u00a0and \"you can't really sell it anyways.\u201d", "Health regulations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, do not allow the commercialization of milk containing colostrum, nor the sale of colostrum as milk. However, farmers such as the one in the YouTube video,\u00a0store this liquid because\u00a0it is an essential part of the diet of newborn calves. Thanks to its nutritional value, colostrum can also be processed and sold as a dietary supplement for human use.", "The farmer further explains that one of the cows has a little bit of blood on its udders due to a blood vessel rupture, and that milking it would likely result in a pinkish liquid.", "The screenshot circulating on Facebook was taken at\u00a03:29 of the video, when the pink liquid from one of the cows arrives in the transparent container. The video also shows that the other two bovines produce a white liquid.", "Liliana Peralta, director of the food engineering department at La Salle University in Bogota, Colombia, told AFP that \u201cwhat is written in the image caption about whitening milk doesn\u2019t happen, (this process) doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d", "\u201cThe Facebook photo does show milk and blood. But this doesn\u2019t occur with all of the milk, only when cows do not have sufficient hygiene and develop mastitis or other illnesses,\u201d Peralta explained during a phone interview.", "\u201cIf the cow has mastitis, it is normal that when the time comes to milk it, blood comes out and milk takes on a pink color. But this milk can\u2019t be sold and regulations (of the dairy industry) mandate that it be discarded. The same thing occurs with pus: it is possible for an ill cow to give milk that contains pus, but those cows are separated from the herd and their production is thrown away,\u201d the professor said.", "Peralta also stressed that \u201craw milk does contain bacteria, hence the importance of the pasteurization process, which is now applied in the entire world.\u201d Lastly, she added that \u201cmilk does not contain carcinogenic elements.\u201d", "Although the viral image did show a container full of blood-contaminated milk, the assertion that milk from cows normally contains blood and must be whitened prior to commercialization is false.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
