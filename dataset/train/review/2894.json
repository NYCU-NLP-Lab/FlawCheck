["\u201cJoe Biden completely botches the Pledge of Allegiance: \u2018I pledge allegiance to the United States of America, one nation, indivisible, under God, for real,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign posted on its official Facebook page on September 22, 2020, along with a video of Biden.", "The same claim was also made on Facebook by prominent conservatives Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Sean Hannity, as well as by Trump\u2019s campaign on Instagram and Republican Party Rapid Response Director Steve Guest on Twitter.", "Trump has sought to portray Biden as sleepy and generally mentally unfit to hold the office of US president, and his alleged inability to say the Pledge of Allegiance fits into that narrative.", "The implication resonated with people who commented on the posts, with one saying: \u201cHow can people think he is mentally capable of running our country,\u201d and another writing: \u201cHe can be the president of the assisted living facility.\u201d", "The pledge, which some students recite at the beginning of school, says: \u201cI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d", "The clip spread by the Trump campaign comes from remarks by Biden on September 21 in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The full version of his speech makes clear that he was not attempting to recite the pledge verbatim.", "Rather, he was criticizing Trump for saying that US coronavirus numbers would be \u201cat a very low level\u201d if Democrat-led states were excluded.", "According to Biden, Trump is \u201csaying if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you\u2019re not his problem -- he has no obligation, he\u2019s not responsible for you as president, your family, or your well-being. I don\u2019t see the presidency that way.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America. I pledge allegiance to the United States of America, one nation, indivisible, under God, for real. I\u2019m running as a proud Democrat, but I\u2019m not gonna govern as a Democratic president, I\u2019m gonna govern as a president,\u201d Biden said.", "In addition to the Trump campaign's false claim about the clip of Biden in Wisconsin, the president and his team have openly spread digitally altered images during the 2020 race.", "AFP Fact check has previously debunked manipulated videos of Biden that Trump has spread on social media, as well as an ad from his campaign that featured doctored images of his Democratic rival.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
