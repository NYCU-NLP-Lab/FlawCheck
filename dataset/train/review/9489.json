["\u201cThe wall is almost complete, we just had to fix little sections, complete little sections,\u201d Trump told Fox\u2019s Maria Bartiromo on March 16, 2021, adding: \u201cThey could have it finished in a month and it would be just magnificent.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s push for a wall on the southern US border was a central part of his run for the presidency in 2016, a move that enthralled his supporters, with chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d a frequent feature of his campaign rallies. He promised that Mexico would pay for the barrier -- something that did not occur.", "Biden opposes the wall and called\u00a0it a \u201cwaste of money\u201d in a January 20 proclamation\u00a0in which he ordered that existing construction projects be paused, and said that it \u201cshall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s claim on the state of the wall is contradicted by information from the CBP, which shows that out of 738 miles that were funded, only 458 had been finished as of January 2021 -- most of it replacement of\u00a0existing barriers.", "According to the CBP, \u201c458 miles of new primary and secondary border wall system have been constructed, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.\u201d", "A further 206 miles were under contract, while 74 miles were \u201cin the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded.\u201d", "A wall covering the entire border would have to stretch nearly 2,000 miles in total. It was not Trump\u2019s plan to cover the whole boundary between the US and Mexico.", "Speaking about vaccines against Covid-19, Trump said of Biden in the interview: \u201cWe gave up to 1.3 millions shots a day before he even took over.\u201d This is inaccurate.", "According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daily vaccinations did not reach that figure until it was surpassed on\u00a0January 20, Biden\u2019s first day in office.", "Trump also said: \u201cWe were energy independent, very shortly we will no longer be energy independent.\u201d This is misleading.", "According to the US Energy Information Administration, America was a net importer of oil for most of Trump\u2019s presidency, though it became a net exporter for part of 2019 and much of 2020.", "Even in months when exports exceeded imports, the US was still buying oil from foreign sources, meaning fluctuations in the international market impacted the country, which also imports other sources of energy.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
