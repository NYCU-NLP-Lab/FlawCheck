["A 19-year-old Dalit woman, who was allegedly gang-raped by four upper-caste men in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Hathras, was cremated in the wee hours of September 30. Family members were locked inside their homes and the victim\u2019s body was burnt without her parents at the site where police formed a human chain to block protesters. In this backdrop, Facebook user Niraj Dhanwal posted an image of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath where he is purportedly seen watching the cremation of the Hathras victim live on a laptop.
