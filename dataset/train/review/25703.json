On June 14, Pirro offered listeners this insight into the ISIS leader. (ISIS is also called ISIL, for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.)", "\"The head of this band of savages is a man named Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the new Osama Bin Laden,\" Pirro said. \"A man released by Obama in 2009, who started ISIS a year later. And when Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers saying, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in New York.\u2019 \"", "A reader wanted to know if Obama actually released Baghdadi, and we decided to look into it. Whatever the truth, the assertion has gained traction. For the president\u2019s critics this fits with their disdain for the recent prisoner swap that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders who had been kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Red State, a conservative blog, used the Baghdadi connection to talk about Obama\u2019s \"catch-and-release\" policy.", "We have two elements to verify. Was Baghdadi in U.S. custody in 2009 and did Obama have a direct connection to his release? We\u2019ll deal with them in order.", "Will the real Abu Bakr al Baghdadi please stand up", "There have been several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- \u00a0that place Baghdadi at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn\u2019t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement.", "\"I\u2019m not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I\u2019m a little surprised it was him,\" King said. \"He was a bad dude, but he wasn\u2019t the worst of the worst.\"", "In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed.", "However, when PunditFact asked the Defense Department to confirm the story, officials there said Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009.", "\"Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as \u2018Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019 was held as a \u2018civilian internee\u2019 by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released,\" the Pentagon said in a statement. \"He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended \u2018unconditional release\u2019 of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time.\"", "In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads ISIS was released in 2004, long before Obama took office, and was not recaptured.", "ABC News also has questioned King\u2019s recollection, citing a \"a U.S. official\" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009.", "\"I could be mistaken,\" King told ABC News, \"but I\u2019m 99 percent.

Bush was president.", "A little backstory. By July 2005, the United States had four detention facilities -- two near Baghdad, one in the northeastern corner of the country, and Camp Bucca in the far southeastern corner near the Kuwait border. The entire operation was known as Task Force 134.", "In the course of the war, some 80,000 people passed through these centers, according to the Defense Department.", "A Pentagon-commissioned study by RAND, a private policy analysis group, described a system that struggled with competing expectations. The incoming population was a mix of captured Sunni and Shiite militants, people rounded up in military raids and ordinary criminals. At times, a blend of overcrowding and sectarian animosities led to riots.", "The RAND study also said the 2007 \"surge\" -- the addition of 20,000 new troops into Iraq to quell spreading unrest -- pushed detainee levels to over 25,000 people.", "From 2007-08, Navy Captain Brian J.

Bill reported that when the boards first began they released about 25 percent of the individuals who came before them. Later, that rose to 40 percent.", "The end of the detention policy", "At the end Bush\u2019s second term in 2008, American and Iraqi negotiators moved toward getting the United States out of the business of holding large numbers of Iraqis. Robert Chesney, professor of international security law at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither side wanted to see the network of detention centers continue.", "\"Its demise reflected a deliberate policy choice by the United States and Iraq to phase out that system and to rely instead on the Iraqi criminal justice system as the sole mechanism for detention going forward,\" Chesney wrote in 2011.", "That goal became part of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, signed in November 2008. Under that agreement the United States agreed to \"turn over custody of such wanted detainees to Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all the remaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner.\"", "The United States\u00a0continued to hold about 200 prisoners judged to pose the greatest risk. They were what remained from a group that numbered about 14,000 at the start of 2009.", "\"Aside from the so-called \u2018Deck of Cards\u2019 detainees held at Camp Cropper (the top leaders in Saddam Hussein\u2019s government), it\u2019s hard to imagine how anyone in Washington would have any interest in who we held or released,\" Bill told PunditFact. \"By the end of 2009, it\u2019s hard to imagine how we could have continued to hold anyone if the Iraqis themselves didn\u2019t decide to detain them.\"", "Our ruling", "Pirro said that Obama released the current head of ISIS from government custody in 2009. The Defense Department said that the man now known as Baghdadi was released in 2004. The evidence that Baghdadi was still in custody in 2009 appears to be the recollection of an Army colonel who said Baghdadi\u2019s \"face is very familiar.\"", "Even if the colonel is right, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis who released him some time later. But more important, the legal contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee was signed during the Bush administration. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi and there is no evidence that he was on anyone\u2019s radar screen, assuming that he was in custody at all in 2009.", "The U.S.-Iraq agreement drove the release of thousands of detainees in 2009, but Obama had nothing to do with that.", "We rate the claim False.", "Fox News, Opening Statement, June 14, 2014", "The Daily Beast, ISIS Leader: \u2018See You in New York\u2019, June 14, 2014", "Fox News, The Kelly File, June 13, 2014", "ABC News, ISIS Leader\u2019s Ominous New York Message in Doubt, But US Still on Edge, June 16, 2014", "NBC News, The Secret Life of ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, June 16, 2014", "Slate, Who Is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?, June 16, 2014", "Aljazeera, The fierce ambition of ISIL's Baghdadi, June 15, 2014", "Red State, Obama\u2019s terrorist catch-and-release program is a success, June 12, 2014", "Independent Journalism Review, Meet the Terrorist Leader of ISIS Released Under President Obama Who is Now Rampaging Across Iraq, June 16, 2014", "The Examiner, Who is the new terrorist leader plundering Iraq, unleashed by the U.S. in 2009? , June 16, 2014", "Brian J.
