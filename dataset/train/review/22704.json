["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on January 31, 2019 | Updated on February 1, 2019", "A claim that the White House may impeach House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is false, but it is still circulating widely online. It stems from a petition created by a conservative commentator and posted on the White House\u2019s web page, \u201cWe the People.\u201d", "The president can\u2019t impeach a member of Congress.", "But a headline circulating online claims: \u201cWhite House to Consider Impeaching Nancy Pelosi for \u2018Treason.\u2019\u201d It came from the notoriously unreliable website NewsPunch, which we\u2019ve written about before, and was copied by other sites.", "That headline, and the story that follows it, is wrong since the White House doesn\u2019t have the power to impeach anyone. Impeachment is a process that begins in the House of Representatives, and no member of the House has ever been impeached.", "Most of the 19 federal officials who have been impeached were judges. There were also two presidents, a cabinet secretary, and a senator who were impeached. Only eight of the 19 were convicted by the Senate and removed from office.", "The claim about Pelosi is based on a petition that was posted Jan. 18 on the White House\u2019s interactive web page \u201cWe the People\u201d by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who describes herself as a \u201cconservative commentator\u201d on her Twitter page. After posting the petition, she promoted it through a story on a website called Law Enforcement Today, which is run by former police officers.", "That story, which was also copied by other websites, claimed in the headline that police are \u201cseeking the removal of Nancy Pelosi,\u201d but it offered no evidence that police officers are calling for the removal of Pelosi. Rather, it focused on the recent federal government shutdown \u2014 and falsely claimed that Pelosi went to Puerto Rico with her Democratic colleagues during that time (she didn\u2019t) \u2014 and argued that, \u201cNancy Pelosi must be impeached, fired, and removed from office, for committing treason.\u201d The story provided a link to the petition.", "Neither Greene nor the operators of the website that published her story responded to our requests for comment.", "Dennis Slocumb, a registered lobbyist for the International Union of Police Associations, told us he was not aware of an effort among officers to remove Pelosi from office. \u201cI have not heard of it at all.\u201d he said. The IUPA is a union that represents law enforcement officers. We also reached out to the Fraternal Order of Police, but didn\u2019t hear back.", "It is, of course, very possible that some of the more than 140,000 people who have signed the petition are police officers, but the petition wasn\u2019t started by police, and it won\u2019t result in the White House impeaching Pelosi.", "Updated, Feb. 1: As a result of our story, Newspunch.com changed its headline and updated its article to say that the White House doesn\u2019t have the power to impeach. In a note to readers, it said: \u201cthe headline has been corrected to \u2018Petition About Impeaching Nancy Pelosi for \u201cTreason\u201d Goes Viral\u2019 to more accurately reflect the facts.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Greene, Marjorie. \u201cPolice Are Now Seeking The Removal Of Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Lawenforcementtoday.com. 26 Jan 2019.", "\u201cImpeach Nancy Pelosi for crimes of Treason!\u201d Petition. Whitehouse.gov. 18 Jan 2019.", "Greene, Marjorie (@mtgreenee). \u201cThanks for sharing this, I\u2019m MG, I created the petition. Read my article here explaining why she should be impeached!\u201d 30 Jan 2019.", "Slocumb, Dennis. Legislative director, The International Union of Police Associations. Phone interview. 29 Jan 2019.", "Adl-Tabatabai. \u201cWhite House to Consider Impeaching Nancy Pelosi for \u2018Treason.\u2019\u201d NewsPunch.com. 29 Jan 2019.", "List of Individuals Impeached by the House of Representatives. Office of the Historian and the\u00a0Clerk of the House of Representative\u2019s Office of Art and Archives. Accessed 30 Jan 2019.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
