Where did this 18 crore come from? -translated)\u201d", "The above message is being shared on social media. It is being claimed that CPI\u2019s Begusarai candidate Kanhaiya Kumar, who even though unemployed, has accumulated assets worth Rs 18 crore while BJP\u2019s Bhopal candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has assets to the tune of Rs 4.5 lakh. The message takes a jibe at Kumar for supposedly accumulating a ludicrous amount of wealth with no employment and also questions the means by which it was harvested. This post shared by a Facebook page, I Love My India, has garnered more than 3,400 shares so far.", "This message has been shared by several other individuals on Facebook and Twitter.", "Alt News found that the claim about Kanhaiya Kumar having assets worth Rs 18 crore, is false, based on his nomination affidavit. In the affidavit filed for his nomination from Bihar\u2019s Begusarai Lok Sabha constituency, Kumar had declared biannual income of Rs 8.5 lakh with assets over Rs 5.5 lakh. The figure stated in his affidavit is nowhere close to the exorbitant number cited in the social media claim. The information about a candidate\u2019s total assets declared at the time of filing his nomination is easily available on MyNeta database.

Based on this figure, the post attempted to question the transparency in Kumar\u2019s public life and also raised doubts over the source of his supposed assets. Kanhaiya Kumar has often been found in the crosshairs of purveyors of misinformation. During the election campaign, a photo of Kumar\u2019s campaign vehicle was photoshopped with the image of Afzal Guru, and a video of his speech was clipped to falsely claim that he said, \u201cHanuman burnt Lanka as another man\u2019s wife was insulted\u201d.", "Donate Now", "Jignesh is a writer and researcher at Alt News.
