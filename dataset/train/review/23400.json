["About this rating", "The month of July 2020 saw the release of \"Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man,\u201d a tell-all book by Mary L. Trump, the niece of U.S. President Donald Trump. Although Trump's younger brother Robert sought to block publication of the work, it was released ahead of scheduled by publisher Simon & Schuster on July 14, 2020.", "While various news outlets obtained copies of the book and reported on its contents in advance of its publication, but \"Too Much and Never Enough\" proved to contain little new information that was truly shocking or surprising. Perhaps its most salacious revelation was Mary Trump's claim that her uncle had secretly paid someone to take the the SAT college-admissions exam in his place in order to ensure he recorded a high score.", "Prior to the book's official release, social media users circulated a purported excerpt from it, a passage in which Mary Trump allegedly described inadvertently walking in on her uncle in bed with his daughter Ivanka:", "(Mary L. Trump and Ivanka Trump are actually first cousins; Mary is not Ivanka's \"aunt.\")", "This \"leaked\" excerpt was nothing more than a prurient fabrication, however. Although Donald Trump has made a number of comments about his daughter that some observers have found unsettling, nothing remotely like what is described above appeared in Mary Trump's book. Certainly an occurrence so shocking would have been mentioned by news outlets that obtained pre-release copies of the book, but none of them did, and we also searched the ebook version of \"Too Much and Never Enough\" subsequent to its official release and found no description that came close to matching the one displayed above.", "The only passage in the book we found that bore the slightest resemblance to the faux \"excerpt\" seen above \u2014 and it was a very slight resemblance \u2014 was the following paragraph:", "\u201cShortly after, Donald came in with his kids and [his brother] Rob\u2019s stepson. With the exception of Eric, they were all teenagers, the boys tall and chubby and wearing suits. Donald went to sit on the chair by the TV, and Ivanka climbed on his lap. The boys started wrestling. Donald watched the action from his chair, kissing Ivanka or pinching her cheek. Every once in a while, he\u2019d stick his foot out and kick whichever boy was being pinned to the floor.\u201d", "Withnall, Adam. \u00a0 \"Donald Trump's Unsettling Record of Comments About His Daughter Ivanka.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Independent. \u00a0 10 October 2016.", "Haberman, Maggie and Alan Feuer. \u00a0 \"Mary Trump\u2019s Book Accuses the President of Embracing \u2018Cheating as a Way of Life.\u2019\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 7 July 2020.", "Lahut, Jake et al. \u00a0 \"5 of the Most Shocking Claims in Mary Trump's Scathing Tell-All Book About the President.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Business Insider. \u00a0 7 July 2020.", "Trump, Mary L. \u00a0 Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Simon & Schuster, 2020. \u00a0 ISBN 1-982-14146-8.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
