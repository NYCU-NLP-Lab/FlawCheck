The tweet was crossposted onto Facebook and shared among several Sanders-aligned groups.", "\"Joe Biden just told @Lawrence that as president he would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses and came to his desk,\" stated the post.", "Biden\u2019s actual answer raised a lot of doubts about the hypothetical situation but wasn\u2019t quite that plain.", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

I want to know, how do they find the $35 trillion? What is that doing? Is it going to significantly raise taxes on the middle class, which it will. What\u2019s going to happen?\"", "He went on to explain his current position against the legislation.", "\"Look, my opposition isn\u2019t to the principle that you should have Medicare. Health care should be a right in America. My opposition relates to whether or not a) it\u2019s doable, 2) what the cost is and what consequences for the rest of budget are. How are you going to find $35 trillion over the next 10 years without having profound impacts on everything from taxes for middle class and working class people as well as the impact on the rest of the budget?\"", "Some media outlets concluded that Biden\u2019s statements mean he would veto Medicare for All.
