None of the versions we could find specified the origin of the claim, and the only substantiation appeared to be a screenshot of a since-deleted post:", "We contacted Chili's media relations department for clarification about whether the chain was donating 15 percent of every check to Planned Parenthood in two states, or in any location.

While our franchise partner had the best intentions; we have received growing feedback and concern from community members regarding the Give Back Event. This feedback does not reflect Chili\u2019s focus on bringing communities together and the event was never intended to be viewed as a partisan event or political statement, therefore we, along with our franchise partner, have decided to cancel the event.", "We will more clearly communicate the focus of Chili\u2019s charitable giving efforts, so that our restaurant managers and franchise partners can feel empowered to support local organizations that bring communities together.", "The Chili's chain at no point had a plan to donate 15 percent of every check to Planned Parenthood. Rather, a single independent franchisee planned to host a \"Chili's Give Back\" event in support of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, an initiative that Chili's and the franchisee canceled after myriad objections.", "The backlash was similar to that stemming from prior claims that Olive Garden \"funded\" Planned Parenthood (false), and that Macy's had stopped \"funding\" the organization (unproven on both counts).", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
