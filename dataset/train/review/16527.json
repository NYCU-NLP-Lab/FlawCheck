["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has become a popular villain for Republican candidates who have been trying to link her to their Democratic opponents.\n\nCase in point: a recent TV ad titled \"Her Congressman\" from Scott Rigell, the Republican candidate for Congress in Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, criticizing the voting record of Rep. Glenn Nye, the Democratic incumbent.\n\n\"Nye voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi, even on the wasteful stimulus bill,\" the ad says. \"Nye votes with Pelosi 83 percent of the time. Glenn Nye is her congressman, not ours.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee makes a similar claim in a TV ad, taking aim at Nye for supporting the economic stimulus package and other Democratic legislation. It says, \"Glenn Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPolitiFact has checked similar claims in other states and found they often exaggerated the correlation with Pelosi, so we decided to take a closer look.\n\nAsked for the source for the claim, both Rigell\u2019s campaign and the NRCC cited a Washington Post voting database.\n\nWe took a look at the database and quickly discovered the campaigns had blurred the details: Nye has voted with his party 82.5 percent of the time since he took office in 2009. But his rate of voting with Pelosi is actually significantly lower -- just 66 percent.\n\nThe Washington Post says its database shows \"the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members\" -- not the correlation with a particular party leader.\n\nThe average party loyalty is 90.6 percent for all House members and 92.2 percent for the 263 Democratic members. But contrary to the implication of the ad, Nye is actually ninth from the bottom for party loyalty among Democrats and Republicans. That indicates he has one of the most independent records.\n\nComparing the voting records of a member of Congress and a House speaker can be misleading because the speaker rarely votes. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted 94 times since the start of 2009, while Nye has cast 1,551 votes.\n\n\"That is just a tradition for speakers -- they often don't vote,\" Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly told PolitiFact. \"She votes on some bills, not all.\"\n\nOf the 91 times when they both voted on matters other than the routine roll call, Nye cast differing votes 31 times. That means they voted together 66 percent of the time.\n\nAnd it\u2019s important to note that Nye and Pelosi differed on health care reform, the signature issue for the Democrats. Nye voted against it, and has touted that vote in his campaign. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd before voting with fellow Democrats to pass the economic stimulus bill in February 2009, Nye voted twice with Republicans to delay action on the plan, saying he wanted more time and more tax cuts.\n\nSo let\u2019s take stock of the facts.\n\nRigell\u2019s ad says Nye \"voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi.\" But the facts don\u2019t support such a strong claim.\n\nIt is incorrect for Rigell to say Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time. That is the percentage for his votes with his party. The actual number with Pelosi is significantly lower -- \u00a066 percent. And both measurements show he is one of the more independent Democrats. Only eight House members have lower party loyalty percentages.\n\nIt\u2019s become a popular Republican tactic to link Democrats with Pelosi, but in this case, the voting records don\u2019t justify the charge. And while Nye has voted with his party 82 percent of the time -- a clear majority of the time -- that\u2019s a long way from being \"in lock step.\"\n\nSo we find Rigell\u2019s claim to be Barely True.", "Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
