Kamala Harris asks \"How can you dream when you are drowning in student loan debt?\" in a section on the rising cost of living in America.", "On the campaign trail, the Democratic presidential hopeful has called student loan debt \"one of the biggest challenges facing our country and our students.\"", "In the Senate, she helped re-introduce the Debt-Free College Act, a bill she says will help reverse the growing student debt crisis. Specifically, it would provide states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education.", "The senator then made this eye-popping claim about how fast student loan debt has grown in a news release on March 6 announcing her support for the bill:", "\"College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.\"", "She\u00a0tweeted a similar claim a few days later.", "But is student loan debt really growing that fast?

A decade later, that number had increased 11 percent to 16.9 million, he said, citing figures from the National Center for Education Statistics.", "Kantrowitz added that another factor is that federal grants have slowed as tuition has gone up. States often cut tuition assistance at the first signs of a financial crisis.", "The average student loan debt was nearly $30,000 for students graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, Kantrowitz said.
