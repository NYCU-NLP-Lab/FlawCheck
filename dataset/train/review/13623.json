["About this rating", "On or around 31 March 2016, Facebook users began sharing\u00a0links to what looked like a link to news reports that\u00a0department store Kohl's\u00a0had declared bankruptcy, and was closing soon 818 stores across the United States.", "Shares of the Kohl's claim looked like this:", "It didn't take a lot of sleuthing to spot\u00a0two major red flags in the Facebook posts.

The user-generated pranks tended to get away\u00a0from their intended audiences and into the wilds of social media rather quickly, and often involved rumors claiming popular chain stores or restaurants were closing nationwide. In March 2016, a spate of similar sites created constellations of false rumors about celebrities moving to small towns.", "As the hoax itself indicated, Kohl's confirmed on 22 March 2016 that 18 stores were closing, or less than\u00a0two percent of the approximately 1,162 locations\u00a0(not 818) currently open for business across the United States.", "Peterson, Hayley. \u00a0 \"See Whether Your Local Kohl's Is Shutting Down.\"\r\nBusiness Insider. \u00a0 22 March 2016.", "Wikpedia. \u00a0 \"Kohl's.\"", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
