["About this rating", "On 11 September 2017, the web site EBUZZ.buzz posted a video on its Facebook page it described as the \"Face Of Hurricane Irma !\":", "The clip quickly went viral, amassing millions of views. But it is neither footage from Hurricane Irma \u2014 which was downgraded to a tropical storm hours after the video was posted \u2014 nor footage shot in Florida, the Caribbean, or in any location affected by the storm. As of 14 September 2017, this video -- as well as one purportedly showing crabs swarming on a road because of the storm -- has been pulled from EBUZZ's Facebook page.", "Another dubious Facebook page calling itself \"Newsroom\" attempted to pass it off as a \"live\" broadcast on 29 December 2017.", "In fact, the footage of the unusual cloud formation was originally shot in the Canadian town of Grand Falls, New Brunswick and posted online on 1 August 2011 by Denis Laforge.", "Laforge can be heard in the clip saying:", "A face. A face. Holy frig.", "After the video began spreading online, he said:", "I really wanted to be neutral when I put the video on YouTube. I\u2019m not saying it was God\u2019s face, the devil\u2019s or any other. I\u2019ve gotten comments that people have seen the villain in Harry Potter. I haven\u2019t seen the last movie of the series so I\u2019ll go see that for sure.", "The site has recycled at least one more piece of footage and passed it off as something showing the effects of Irma. On 9 September 2017, it posted video of a double tornado, claiming that it was shot \"live\" in Florida. In reality, the video was posted in June 2007, and it shows two funnel clouds near the Italian island of Elba in August 2006.", "Rankin, Andrew. \"Video: Ghostly Cloud Faces Appear Over New Brunswick.\"\r\nToronto Star. 11 August 2011.", "\"OMG!!!\" YouTube.\r\nUploaded by denisfarmer, 1 August 2011.", "\"The Perfect Storm - Double Tornado.\" YouTube.\r\nUploaded by nico87mi. 11 June 2007.", "Update [29 December 2017]: Noted that another Facebook page tried to pass the footage off as a live broadcast.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
