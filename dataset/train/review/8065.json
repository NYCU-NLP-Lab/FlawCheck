He fired back that she opposed driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants.", "\"Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver's licenses to those who are undocumented,\" Sanders said during the debate at Miami Dade College on March 9. \"She said \u2018don\u2019t do it\u2019, and New York state still does not do it.\"", "Did Clinton -- who has sought the Latino vote in Florida and elsewhere -- prevail upon Spitzer to not allow driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants in New York?", "Clinton on driver\u2019s licenses in 2008 race", "In September 2007, Spitzer proposed giving driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants.

He is dealing with a serious problem. We have failed, and George Bush has failed. Do I think this is the best thing for any governor to do? No. But do I understand the sense of real desperation, trying to get a handle on this? Remember, in New York we want to know who's in New York. We want people to come out of the shadows. He's making an honest effort to do it. We should have passed immigration reform.\"", "About two weeks later, Spitzer dropped his plan, saying it faced opposition.", "During the March 2016 debate, Sanders\u2019 campaign sent a November 2007 New York Times story about a statement Clinton made saying she supported his decision to drop the plan.", "\"As president, I will not support drivers' licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system.\"", "Spitzer, who resigned in 2009 amid a prostitution scandal, talked about Clinton\u2019s past statements on driver\u2019s licenses in an interview he gave to David Axelrod in 2015.", "\"When Mr. Axelrod asked if the Clinton campaign had asked Mr. Spitzer to scrap the plan, he replied, \u2018Yeah, we heard from folks who said they want this issue gone,\u2019 \" the New York Times reported.", "Clinton on driver\u2019s licenses in 2016 race", "But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton changed her position.", "In April 2015, a Clinton spokeswoman told the Huffington Post: \"Hillary supports state policies to provide driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.\"", "Clinton herself addressed it during a town hall in February.", "\"Back then, it was a state-by-state determination, and I'm happy that most states have understood and moved in the right direction,\" she said.", "PolitiFact contacted spokespersons for Clinton\u2019s campaign during the debate and asked if she had any evidence to refute Sanders\u2019 claim and did not get a reply.", "In a conference call with reporters the day before the debate, Clinton surrogates didn\u2019t answer questions about why she changed her position.", "\"Today our goal has moved well beyond driver's\u2019 licenses,\" U.S. Rep.
