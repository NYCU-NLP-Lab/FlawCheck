The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks \u2018don\u2019t work.\u2019\"", "But he doesn\u2019t prove that at all.", "The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don\u2019t protect against passing the coronavirus. After all, people breathe in and out with masks on.", "\"By that illogic, the fact that air can pass through a mask could be cited as \u2018evidence\u2019\u00a0as well,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.", "Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, called the video \"completely misleading.\"", "\"Fabric and surgical/procedure masks are meant to help protect against larger droplet particles that may contain COVID-19,\" she said. \"You have to be able to breathe through a mask, and he is just blowing out water vapor, so that is expected to be able to go through a mask.\"", "The Facebook post that includes the video clip was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

He also argued that\u00a0\"basically, the only way droplets can spread COVID-19 is if an ill person happens to be quite close to an uninfected person who happens to be breathing in at the exact moment that the ill person expels the droplets.\"", "Noel has repeatedly railed against masks. On Jan. 31, he wrote: \"Most Americans intuitively recognize that masks don\u2019t reduce infections. But they go along with the virtue signaling to be good citizens.\" In his email, he called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, \"a lab rat turned bureaucrat who plays a doctor on TV.\"", "Noel's claims\u00a0on countering the spread of the coronavirus are contradicted by public health experts.", "The clip demonstrates that \"to work properly, even the best masks or respirators need to fit properly, without gaps, and not everything that looks like a really good mask necessarily has good filtration,\" said Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Medical Center.", "But \"it is a leap to go from there to generalizing that \u2018masks don\u2019t work,\u2019\" he said. Many peer-reviewed studies show \"that masks do have a significant effect.

The droplets can be transmitted between people through touch or through the air, typically when people are less than 6 feet apart.", "Measures such as mask wearing, social distancing and hand hygiene \"appear sufficient to address transmission both through close contact and under the special circumstances favorable to potential airborne transmission,\" the brief said.", "\"Multi-layer cloth masks block release of exhaled respiratory particles into the environment, along with the microorganisms these particles carry,\" the CDC said in a November 2020 research brief. \"Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets, but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles, also often referred to as aerosols.\"", "The CDC recommends that people wear masks \"in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people\" to slow the spread of COVID-19, because masks provide a barrier that keeps the respiratory droplets from spreading between people.", "On Jan. 29, the CDC ordered that masks be worn on public conveyances, such as airplanes, subways, buses and cabs, and in transportation hubs such as airports and bus stations.", "A widely shared Facebook post that includes a video clip claims that a \"doctor proves masks don\u2019t work\" by showing vapor from an electronic cigarette passing through a mask.", "Experts say the fact that masks allow e-cigarette vapor to pass through provides no evidence to back the claim.
