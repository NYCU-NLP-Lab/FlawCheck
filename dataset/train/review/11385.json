It\u2019s fascinating.

Crimea was part of the Soviet Union until 1954, when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave the territory to Ukraine (more history in this fact-check). Russia maintains a military base in the Sevastopol under a post-Soviet breakup treaty between Russia and Ukraine.", "News outlets wrote of Russian-speaking, armed soldiers unloaded from armored vehicles whose service uniforms \"bore no insignia\" though their vehicles featured Russian military plates of the country\u2019s Black Sea force. The troops \"swarmed the major thoroughfares of Crimea,\" wrote the New York Times, shutting down the area\u2019s main airport and surrounding government buildings.", "Despite their lack of traditional military ID, \"there was no doubt among residents they were deployed from the nearby Russian base to take up position outside a Ukrainian border guard base,\" Reuters wrote. The Guardian estimates 16,000 \"pro-Russian troops\" are controlling Crimea and blockading Ukrainian bases.", "In a March 4 news conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Russian troops were occupying Crimea as he said that Russia would only resort to military action \"for the protection of the Ukrainian people.\" Putin chastised the U.S. government for interfering in Ukraine\u2019s affairs like a scientist with rats.", "\"There are many military uniforms.

But since it\u2019s cold over there, he is also seeing pictures of Russian soldiers bundled up in winter clothes, which are less likely to have unit insignias than combat uniforms, he said.", "\"It's also possible that they were ordered to take off unit insignias in order to either confuse the Ukrainians initially or to try and appear a bit less threatening,\" Janda said. \"In any case, I think it's an overstatement to stay the Russians were not wearing military uniforms. The safer, more accurate statement would be that some Russian soldiers appear to have not been wearing uniforms.\"", "Janda said the size of the Russian military presence in Crimea \"has surely been augmented\" since the original reports of 16,000. From a distance, it\u2019s hard to tell.", "Janda agrees with Matthews\u2019 overall assertion that neither side wants a war, and the Russians \"are going in as \u2018light\u2019 as they can. ...
