["For the news media citing a lack of detail in Mitt Romney\u2019s proposals, Gov. Chris Christie offers these instructions: be fair to the Republican presidential nominee and get tough on President Barack Obama for not providing the specifics behind his own promises.\n\nDuring an interview Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" host David Gregory noted how Romney has failed to enumerate which tax deductions he would eliminate, and asked Christie whether Romney would provide those details during Wednesday\u2019s debate.\n\nThe New Jersey governor argued that the media should be \"just as tough on the president\" for failing to explain how he would reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion.\n\n\"He says he\u2019s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn\u2019t say how he\u2019s going to do it,\" Christie, a Republican, told Gregory. \"I mean, you know, let\u2019s be fair here.\"\n\nThe governor repeated that claim later in the interview, saying Obama \"puts out a nice two-minute ad that says he\u2019s going to reduce the debt by four trillion, but never tells us how.\"\n\nOK, governor, let\u2019s be fair: you\u2019re wrong to claim Obama has not outlined his deficit reduction plan.\n\nIn an 80-page report issued in September 2011 and again in the president\u2019s budget proposal released in February, the Obama administration has laid out detailed proposals and dollar amounts for how to achieve more than $4 trillion in savings over the next decade.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.\n\nLet\u2019s explain some of those details.\n\nObama\u2019s deficit reduction plan relies on a mix of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts.\n\nA large part of the savings would come from roughly $1.5 trillion worth of tax reform measures. For instance, the plan would allow federal income tax cuts to expire for upper-income taxpayers, while extending them for other Americans.\n\nThe president\u2019s plan also would reduce certain tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers and close various tax loopholes, such as by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies.\n\nIn many cases, the reform proposals are so specific that only tax policy wonks may really understand them.\n\nAnother roughly $850 billion in savings would come from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the president\u2019s budget. In addition, the deficit reduction plan accounts for roughly $1 trillion in spending cuts built into legislation signed by the president last year.\n\nThe Obama administration also has provided specific proposals for more than $500 billion in spending cuts and reforms to mandatory programs.\n\nThose provisions include changes to Medicare and Medicaid; a reduction in certain agricultural subsidies; and a series of reforms within the U.S. Postal Service, such as reducing mail delivery from six days to five days per week.\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s plan has received both praise and criticism.\n\n\"Such a balanced approach -- both increases in revenues and reductions in spending -- is the only approach that will put the budget on an economically and politically sustainable path,\" wrote James R. Horney, vice president of Federal Fiscal Policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\n\nBut Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, said in a news release that \"the use of this war gimmick is quite troubling.\n\n\"Drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings,\" she said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an interview on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" Christie claimed Obama \"says he\u2019s gonna reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn\u2019t say how he's gonna do it.\"\n\nBut the president has outlined in extensive detail how he would achieve more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. That plan has received mixed reviews, but it\u2019s ridiculous for Christie to suggest Obama has not provided such specific proposals.\n\nSo, governor, here\u2019s a fiery dose of fairness for you: Pants on Fire!", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d67054db-a2e9-4a49-b5a7-edc9ea760199", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Chris Christie On Meet the Press, a video posted on YouTube on Sept. 30, 2012\n\nMeet the Press transcript, Sept. 30, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Obama says his budget plan will cut deficits by $4 trillion, Sept. 7, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Mitt Romney would add \"trillions\" to the deficit while Barack Obama would \"cut the deficit by $4 trillion,\" says Obama TV ad, Aug. 7, 2012\n\nWhite House, Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President\u2019s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction, Sept. 19, 2011\n\nWhite House, Fiscal Year 2013 Budget: Cutting Waste, Reducing the Deficit, and Asking All to Pay Their Fair Share, accessed Oct. 2, 2012\n\nWhite House, Fiscal Year 2013 Budget: Summary Tables, accessed Oct. 2, 2012\n\nWhite House, FACT SHEET: The President's Framework for Shared Prosperity and Shared Fiscal Responsibility, April 13, 2011\n\nFactCheck.org, Obama\u2019s Stump Speech, Sept. 19, 2012\n\nFactCheck.org, FactChecking Obama and Biden, Sept. 7, 2012\n\nThe Washington Post, Is Obama\u2019s $4 trillion deficit-reduction plan for real?, Sept. 6, 2012\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, CRFB on President Obama\u2019s Deficit Reduction Plan, Sept. 19, 2011\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, CRFB Reacts to the President\u2019s FY 2013 Budget, Feb. 13, 2012\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Federal Deficit Reduction Plan Comparison Tool, accessed Oct. 2, 2012\n\nWhite House, Fact Sheet: Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future - The President\u2019s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction, Sept. 19, 2011\n\nHeritage Foundation, Heritage Responds to Obama\u2019s Debt Reduction and Tax Proposal, Sept. 19, 2011\n\nCato Institute, The Spend Now, Tax Later Jobs Bill, Sept. 22, 2011\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, Statement: James R.
