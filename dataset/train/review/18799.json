["A video featuring people waiting at a bus stand has taken social media by storm. In the clip, a woman without a face mask can be seen sitting among people who are all wearing one. One of these people asks the woman why she is not wearing a mask. In response, she says that healthy people do not need to wear masks. She tells him that masks are required only in case of a cold or while visiting hospitals or caring for a sick person. After this, the people sitting around her also take off their masks. At the end of the clip, the logos of the National Health Mission and Madhya Pradesh government are visible. The video has confused several social media users as people have been fined for not wearing masks but this video by the National Health Mission promotes selective use of masks.", "On August 22, Facebook user Dipak C.
