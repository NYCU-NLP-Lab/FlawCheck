["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Austin City Council candidate Shaun Ireland recently claimed, in his campaign video among several from candidates posted on the city\u2019s website, \"Not a single City Council member lives in South Austin. Nor in North Austin.\"\n\nIn May 2011, we looked at a candidate\u2019s statement that \"there\u2019s no one from South Austin on the council,\" and found that was True.\n\nOnly one face on the council has changed since then, but what about their current home addresses?\n\nIreland, who himself lives on Manchaca Road in the South Lamar neighborhood of South Austin, told us by email that he pulled council members\u2019 addresses from their personal financial statements filed with the city, and sent us his findings.\n\nMeanwhile, in an Austin American-Statesman news story published online May 7, 2012, he narrowed his claim, saying that \"no council member lives south of (Lady Bird Lake) or north of 45th Street.\"\n\nWe called council members\u2019 city and campaign staff for the most up-to-date information.\n\nIreland\u2019s opponent, Place 6 incumbent and Mayor Pro Tem Sheryl Cole, is one of two council members who live in East Austin -- Cole in Wilshire Woods and Mike Martinez in Senate Hills.\n\nMayor Lee Leffingwell lives in the Highland Park West/Balcones Area neighborhood. Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. The council\u2019s newest member, Kathie Tovo, lives north of the University of Texas in the Heritage neighborhood.\n\nAll the addresses are north of Lady Bird Lake. Are they all south of 45th Street?\n\nThis is where Ireland\u2019s claim gets interesting, because 45th Street does not extend across the entire city. It\u2019s not oriented directly east-west, either.\n\nBut if you drew a line extending 45th Street across the entire city map, Martinez and Leffingwell\u2019s homes would both lie less than a mile north of that line.\n\nIreland told us, \"All City Council members live within six miles of each other \u2026 none live south of downtown or north of Koenig (Lane) -- magnetic north, true north, or past the 45th street parallel, whichever the case may be. There are no council members that reside in the Arboretum or near Parmer and Metric, or Onion Creek or the \u2018Y\u2019 at Oak Hill.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nNo council members live in South Austin, as Ireland says, and five council members live south of 45th Street. If that street were extended east and west, though, Leffingwell and Martinez would land north of it, though not by much. We rate Ireland\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "Campaign video from Austin City Council Place 6 candidate Shaun Ireland, city website, March 30, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Texas fact-check, \"Max Nofziger says Austin City Council bereft of South Austinites,\" May 3, 2012\n\nTelephone and email interviews with Austin City Council candidate Shaun Ireland, May 2-8, 2012\n\nCopies of Austin finance reports supplied by Shaun Ireland\u2019s campaign, accessed May 4, 2012\n\nAustin American-Statesman news story, \"Plan for Austin City Council districts facing hurdles,\" April 22, 2012\n\nAustin American-Statesman news story, \"Cole-Ireland council race has insider-outsider contrast,\" May 7, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Amy Everhart, policy director for Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, May 4-9, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Matt Parkerson, executive aide to Austin Council Member Christopher Riley, May 4, 2012", "Telephone and email interviews with Sylvia Camarillo, campaign manager for Austin Council Member Mike Martinez, May 4, 2012", "Telephone interview with Karen Roberts, executive assistant to Austin Council Member Kathie Tovo, May 4, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Joi Harden, policy aide to Austin Council Member Kathie Tovo, May 9, 2012", "Telephone and email interviews with Barbara Rush, policy advisor to Austin Council Member Laura Morrison, May 4, 2012", "Telephone interview with Deena Estrada, constituent services aide to Austin Council Member Bill Spelman, May 4, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Phylis Gage, constituent liaison for Austin Council Member Sheryl Cole, May 4, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
