["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on December 9, 2020", "At a rally in Georgia, President Donald Trump continued to make baseless claims about the 2020 election being \u201crigged,\u201d drawing false comparisons at one point between President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s performance in swing states and that of the last two Democratic presidential nominees:", "The president visited Valdosta, Georgia, on Dec. 5 to campaign for the state\u2019s two Republican senators who were forced into runoff elections against their Democratic challengers. But the president spent most of his 90-minute speech repeating false, misleading and unsupported claims about the election that he made just a few days earlier in an online video that he billed as perhaps \u201cthe most important speech I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d", "At the rally, Trump insisted that he won Georgia (\u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand\u201d) and Wisconsin (\u201cWell, actually I won Wisconsin\u201d) \u2014 even though both states have certified Biden as the winner after recounts. Georgia counted its ballots three times.", "Trump also repeated bogus claims about secret, illegal ballot \u201cdumps\u201d in both states that we have already debunked. This time, the president suggested that the ballot \u201cdumps\u201d explain what he described as a \u201cvery interesting\u201d and \u201cstatistically impossible\u201d anomaly in some swing states won by Biden. (His campaign has gone to court to challenge the results in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.)", "After correctly noting that he won Florida, Ohio, South Carolina and Iowa, the president said this:", "Trump, Dec. 5:\u00a0And we won all over the place. And many of these swing states, you know, it\u2019s a very interesting statistic. President Obama beat Biden all over the country, except in some of the swing states where Biden beat him badly. How does that work? And they say it\u2019s statistically impossible. He beat crooked Hillary. Think of this. He beat crooked Hillary in the swing states, but she beat him everywhere else. Let me tell you, this election was rigged.", "All of that is wrong.", "\u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018statistical impossibility,\u2019 for starters,\u201d Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told us in an email.", "Using Dave Leip\u2019s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections, we looked at the 2016 results and found that Biden outperformed Clinton in every state \u2014 not just swing states \u2013 both by the number and the percentage of votes. (The unofficial 2020 results were as of Dec. 8.)", "Stewart said he prefers comparing candidates by percentage of votes, but without minor party candidates\u2019 vote totals. By that measure, we found Clinton outperformed Biden in only six states (California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada and New York) and Washington, D.C. Only one of them \u2014 Nevada \u2014 is a swing state where Trump has been contesting the results. Clinton barely edged Biden there, garnering 51.29% of the Nevada vote, compared with Biden\u2019s 51.22%.", "In his own analysis of the 2020 and 2016 elections for us, Stewart said he found \u201cwhat political scientists would call a \u2018uniform swing\u2019 for Biden nationwide,\u201d with some minor variations.", "\u201c[T]he way elections work, it would be unlikely a winning candidate would do better (compared to 4 years before) in only the close states and not the uncompetitive states,\u201d Stewart said.", "Stewart provided this scatterplot that shows a \u201cuniform swing\u201d toward Biden.", "\u201cThere are 51 circles, one for each state plus DC. The diagonal line is where every state would be if the vote share for Biden = the vote share for Clinton,\u201d Stewart said, explaining his chart. \u201cAs you can see, the circles are sitting mostly right on top of the line, which is consistent with Biden being just a few points ahead of Clinton in almost all the states.\u201d", "By any measure, Trump\u2019s wrong to say that Clinton beat Biden everywhere, except swing states.", "We also reviewed the 2012 and 2008 election results and found that Barack Obama did have a higher percentage of the total vote than Biden in most states: 29 states in 2012 and 37 states (plus Washington, D.C.) in 2008. But Obama also did better than Biden in four of the six swing states now being contested by Trump \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania \u2014 in 2008 and 2012. As a percentage of the vote, Biden did better than Obama only in Georgia and Arizona \u2014 two other states where Trump is contesting the results.", "However, even without the electoral votes in Georgia (16) and Arizona (11), Biden would still have enough electoral votes to beat Trump. The unofficial election results show Biden with 306 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 232. It takes 270 electoral votes to become president.", "By vote totals, Biden did better than Obama in nearly all states \u2014 although that\u2019s not surprising since there were also far more people who voted in 2020 (158,507,629) than had voted eight years ago in 2012 (129,237,642) and 12 years ago in 2008 (131,473,705):", "So, no matter how one looks at the election results, Trump is also wrong to say that \u201cPresident Obama beat Biden all over the country, except in some of the swing states.\u201d", "By total votes, Biden did better than Obama in most states, including swing states. By vote percentage, Obama did better than Biden in most states, including in most swing states.", "Once again, the president is peddling false information that fails to support his baseless claim that the election was \u201crigged.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
