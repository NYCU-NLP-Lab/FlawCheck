A day later Zafar denied all allegations and tweeted that he will take the case \u201cthrough the court of law\u201d. Last September, multiple other women came forward with similar allegations.", "New18, ABP News, DNA, Republic, Amar Ujala, Aaj Tak, IB Times and Newsd were among the media outlets that claimed Meesha will face three years in prison. \u201cAs per Mail Online, Shaafi, who accused Zafar of sexually harassing her during the #MeToo 2018 movement, faces a three-year jail term in Pakistan after Ali filed criminal defamation charge against her,\u201d reported Zee News.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "Other platforms that reported the same were Koimoi and SheThePeople.", "Reports carried by Indian media outlets have got several facts of the case wrong. For starters, Meesha Shafi was not sentenced to three years in prison by a Pakistani court but the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing booked eight women, including Shafi, who had levelled charges of sexual harassment against Zafar. Shafi was the only one who had lodged a formal complaint. An FIR was filed against the women for a non-cognisable offence on the order of the FIA special court, based on a complaint filed by Zafar alleging a smear campaign, reported Pakistan-based Dawn on September 29, 2020. \u201cA verdict is yet to be announced,\u201d reported Dawn in a recent article.", "The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) had published an extensive report on March 12 explaining the details of the case. In the latest development, the Supreme Court agreed to deliberate on whether her allegations against Zafar fall under the country\u2019s Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act of 2010. This was after Shafi lost a series of legal battles in which judicial authorities ruled that her case isn\u2019t covered by the law.", "The report in WSJ does not say that she has been awarded three years imprisonment but that she could face up to three years of jail time if she is convicted in the defamation case filed by Zafar. According to Dawn, the defamation case has been pending before a session\u2019s court.", "British tabloid Daily Mail\u2019s erroneous interpretation of WSJ\u2019s report was referred by multiple Indian media outlets.", "Shafi\u2019s lawyer Asad Jamal took to Twitter to clarify that media reports have published false news. \u201cLet there be no confusion that no such verdict has been passed by any court in Pakistan. In fact, the court has not even indicted any of the several men and women accused by Ali Zafar of spreading falsehood,\u201d he wrote.", "This is with ref to the fake news claiming that my client Meesha Shafi has been sentenced to 3 yrs imprisonment. No such verdict has been passed by trial court in the frivolous criminal defamation case instituted by Ali Zafar against several women.
