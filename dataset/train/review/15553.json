["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 27, 2017 | Corrected on February 10, 2017", "President Donald Trump claimed that the Islamic State, or ISIS, would not exist if the U.S. \u201ckept the oil when we got out\u201d of Iraq. In fact, ISIS largely has been funded through extortion, robbery, taxes and Syrian oil, according to government reports and terrorism financing experts.", "\u201cTrump is absolutely correct that oil sales have been a critical part of ISIS\u2019s revenue stream since at least early 2014, but he\u2019s wrong that an ongoing American occupation of the Iraqi oilfields would have bankrupted ISIS,\u201d Peter Harrell, the deputy assistant secretary for Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions in the State Department under President Obama, told us in an email. \u201cIf you look at the facts on the ground ISIS has likely always produced more oil in Syria than in Iraq.\u201d", "Howard J. Shatz, a staff member of President George W. Bush\u2019s\u00a0Council of Economic Advisers, concurred. In a phone interview, Shatz \u2014 who is now a senior economist at the RAND Corporation\u00a0and whose research includes the finances and management of ISIS \u2014 told us revenue from Iraqi oil fields \u201cwould not have made much of a difference\u201d to ISIS.", "\u201cThey\u00a0did have control over some Iraq oil fields, but they were nothing compared with Syrian oil fields,\u201d Shatz said.", "As a candidate, Trump frequently mentioned that the United States should have kept the oil in Iraq as compensation for the money that the U.S. spent during the Iraq War and reconstruction. It is something that he has been saying for years, dating to at least 2011.", "In remarks\u00a0he made at the CIA during his first full day in office, Trump brought up the Iraq oil fields again. He turned at one point to Rep. Mike Pompeo, who has since been confirmed by the Senate as Trump\u2019s CIA director, and suggested that ISIS probably would not exist \u201cif we kept the oil\u201d in Iraq.", "Trump, Jan. 21:\u00a0I always used to say, keep the oil. I wasn\u2019t a fan of Iraq. I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong. And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil. Now, I said it for economic reasons. But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn\u2019t have ISIS because that\u2019s where they made their money in the first place. So we should have kept the oil. But okay. Maybe you\u2019ll have another chance. But the fact is, should have kept the oil.", "The president repeated that claim three times during an interview with ABC News\u2019 David Muir that aired on Jan. 25, when Trump was asked about his remarks at the CIA.", "Muir, Jan. 25:\u00a0You brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days. You said, \u201cWe should\u2019ve kept the oil but okay maybe we\u2019ll have another chance.\u201d What did you mean by that?", "Trump:\u00a0Well, we should\u2019ve kept the oil when we got out. And, you know, it\u2019s very interesting, had we taken the oil, you wouldn\u2019t have ISIS because they fuel themselves with the oil. That\u2019s where they got the money.", "In that same interview, Trump later said, \u201cWe should have taken the oil. You wouldn\u2019t have ISIS if we took the oil.\u201d And still later he said, \u201cWe should\u2019ve taken the oil. And if we took the oil you wouldn\u2019t have ISIS.\u201d", "Let\u2019s briefly recap how and when ISIS formed, and then look at how it was financed.", "As we have written before, the terrorist group has its roots in the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian, formed al Qaeda in Iraq (AQ-I) in October 2004, according to a Jan. 18 report\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Zarqawi was\u00a0killed in a U.S. airstrike in June 2006, and shortly after\u00a0\u201cAQ-I leaders repackaged the group as a coalition called the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI),\u201d CRS said.", "Islamic State of Iraq became known as ISIS in April 2013.", "CRS, Jan. 18:\u00a0By early 2013, the group was conducting dozens of deadly attacks a month inside Iraq and had begun operations in neighboring Syria. In April 2013, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi announced his intent to merge his forces in Iraq and Syria with those of the Syria-based, Al Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al Nusra (Support Front), under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS).", "Experts we interviewed attributed the rise of ISIS to multiple factors, most flowing from the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq: sectarian strife in Iraq (Sunni opposition to U.S. forces and the ruling Shia party); decisions by the U.S.-led provisional coalition government in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army\u00a0and ban the Baath Party, driving Sunnis into militant groups; the rule of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose Shia government further ostracized Sunnis; the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011 \u2014 a date agreed to\u00a0by President Bush and carried out by the Obama administration; the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011; and the weakening of the Iraqi army, which\u00a0abandoned its posts in Mosul in June 2014\u00a0and gave control of the city to ISIS.", "For this story, we interviewed experts on ISIS and terrorism financing and reviewed government statements and reports regarding the group\u2019s finances.", "In its early years, the\u00a0Islamic State of Iraq\u2019s revenue-generating activities \u201cclosely resembled that of petty criminality, including significant revenues generated from sales of stolen goods,\u201d according to \u201cFoundations of the Islamic State: Management, Money and Terror in Iraq 2005-2010,\u201d a 2016 report co-authored by Shatz for the RAND Corporation.", "RAND Corporation report, May 19, 2016:\u00a0ISI\u2019s revenue-generating activities in its formative years in Anbar governorate closely resembled that of petty criminality, including significant revenues generated from sales of stolen goods. In its new stronghold of Mosul, the group made money from new sources, particularly theft and extortion from the local oil sector and contract-based projects that were vulnerable to the group\u2019s influence. ISI\u2019s revenue-generating activities in Mosul in 2008 and 2009 closely resembled activities commonly used by organized-crime syndicates.", "The RAND Corporation\u2019s report is based on documents and ledgers obtained from high-level officials within the Islamic State of Iraq. Shatz told us the group\u2019s oil revenue was not a source of financing from 2005 to 2008, and there was not much from 2010 to 2012.", "But for a brief time, from August 2008 to early 2009, the Islamic State of Iraq received about 39 percent of its revenue from Iraqi oil fields.", "\u201cBut don\u2019t forget this is happening at a time when we have 150,000 troops on the ground, when we are working very closely with Iraq on security, conducting a withering counter-terrorism strategy,\u201d Shatz said, referring to the heavy presence of U.S. troops in the late 2000s. \u201cThis says we can\u2019t be every place at every time.\u201d", "Luay al-Khatteeb, the founding director of Iraq Energy Institute, wrote in February 2016 that the importance of oil revenue for ISIS and its predecessor was \u201cvastly over-estimated,\u201d writing \u201coil was not and is still not critical for IS.\u201d", "\u201cIts predecessor, the Islamic State of Iraq, managed to cause chaos for almost a decade without control over a single wellhead,\u201d\u00a0wrote Khatteeb, who is also a nonresident fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.", "In March 2011, the Syrian civil war started and the terrorist group began taking control of that country\u2019s oil producing regions, as explained in an April 2015 report by the Congressional Research Service.", "CRS, April 10, 2015: Much of the physical and economic damage to the Syrian oil sector took place between March 2011 and June 2014, when IS forces expanded their control of oil producing regions in northeast.", "By late 2012, the Islamic State was reaping \u201cmassive cashflows\u201d from eastern Syrian oil wells, selling the crude oil back to the Syrian government, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by the Guardian.", "Guardian, June 15, 2014: Over the past year, foreign intelligence officials had learned that Isis secured massive cashflows from the oilfields of eastern Syria, which it had commandeered in late 2012, and some of which it had sold back to the Syrian regime. It was also known to have reaped windfalls from smuggling all manner of raw materials pillaged from the crumbling state, as well as priceless antiquities from archaeological digs.", "But oil revenue was not the group\u2019s primary source of funds in 2014 or 2015, according to U.S. terrorism financing officials and government reports.", "In a February 2015 speech, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Jennifer Fowler listed four primary revenue sources, in order:", "Harrell, who was\u00a0the deputy assistant secretary for Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions from 2012 to 2014, told us in an email that revenue from Iraqi oil fields was not as important as robbery and other criminal activity.", "\u201cWithin Iraq, ISIS\u2019s largest sources of revenue were robbery and looting \u2014 for example, in 2014 ISIS may have looted more than $400 million from the Iraqi central bank branch in Mosul (when ISIS overran Mosul in 2014),\u201d Harrell said. \u201cISIS also always extorted large sums of money from the population under its control in Iraq.\u201d", "In her speech, Fowler did not say how much of ISIS\u2019s oil revenue came from Iraq in 2014. But al-Khatteeb of the Iraq Energy Institute in a September 2014 CNN interview estimated at that time that two-thirds of ISIS\u2019s oil production came from Syria: 25,000 barrels per day from Iraq and 50,000 barrels per day from Syria.", "ISIS generated much more oil revenue in 2015. But again, it was not the group\u2019s primary source of financing, and most oil revenue still came from Syrian oil fields \u2014 not Iraqi oil fields.", "ISIS had total revenues of $1.18 billion in 2015, according to a 2016 report\u00a0by the inspectors general for the State Department, Defense Department and US AID. The terrorist group\u2019s primary source of financing that year was extortion, stolen goods and taxes, at a combined total of $600 million.\u00a0Oil accounted for $480 million.", "That report didn\u2019t say how much oil revenue came from Iraq and how much came from Syria. However, a former Bush administration counterterrorism official told the House Financial Services Committee in May 2015 that about 90 percent of oil produced by ISIS came from Syrian oil fields.", "\u201cThe group is estimated to produce forty-four thousand barrels a day from Syrian wells and four thousand barrels a day from Iraqi ones. The group then sells the crude to truckers and middlemen, netting an estimated $1 to $3 million a day,\u201d\u00a0said Celina Realuyo, who\u00a0served as the State Department director of Counterterrorism Finance Programs from 2002 to 2006 and is now\u00a0a professor at the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies at the National Defense University.", "At a Nov. 13, 2015,\u00a0press conference, Col. Steve Warren, a defense spokesman, said about two-thirds of ISIS\u2019 oil revenue comes from one region in Syria along the\u00a0eastern border with Iraq.\u00a0\u201cWe estimate that about two-thirds of their oil revenue comes from the Deir ez-Zor region,\u201d Warren said.", "While ISIS has controlled most of Syrian oil fields, the group has had control of only some smaller oil fields in Northern Iraq, Shatz said. Iraq\u2019s principal petroleum centers are located in the south and have been largely unaffected by the Iraq War and Syrian civil war.", "For that reason, Shatz said that ISIS\u2019 revenue from Iraqi oil fields has been helpful, but not essential to the group\u2019s finances.", "\u201cEven if the Northern Iraqi fields had been well protected [by the U.S.], it would not have made much of a difference because they had Syrian fields,\u201d Shatz said.", "Trump said \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have ISIS\u201d if the U.S. had \u201ckept the oil\u201d in Iraq, because \u201cthat\u2019s where they got the money.\u201d But the evidence shows ISIS had a diversified portfolio and received more of its finances from robbery, extortion, taxes and Syrian oil than it did from Iraqi oil fields.", "Correction, Feb. 10: We have fixed\u00a0a typo.
