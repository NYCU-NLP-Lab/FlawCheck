The catch-all bill funds the federal government through Sept. 30, 2016.", "The type of expenditures vary quite a bit, covering benefit extensions for 9/11 first-responders and an increase in research dollars for the National Institutes of Health. The bill lumps together multiple spending bills.", "At PolitiFact Arizona, we were most interested in Trump\u2019s claim that the omnibus \"funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix.\"", "The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment.", "Maybe because that\u2019s because Trump is wrong.", "The omnibus bill does not fund undocumented immigrants \"coming in and through\" the border. In fact, it funds the very agency tasked with keeping undocumented immigrants out, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "\"The salary of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is contained in that bill,\" said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. \"If they weren\u2019t funded, they\u2019d have to stop patrolling.\"", "What Trump could have meant -- though it\u2019s not what he said -- is that undocumented immigrants in the United States may be benefitting from subsidies such as food stamps through their children.

But the omnibus did include relatively small amounts of discretionary spending, which includes services such as community health clinics. The bill also funded the Health and Human Services Department, which received $75.2 billion.", "De Rugy said the bill pays for \"only a little\" of the Affordable Care Act, namely administrative costs.", "The omnibus provides humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees in Jordan. The bill also funds refugees, in general, settling in the United States. It does not specifically fund Syrian refugees.", "\"Those restrictions were left out of the omnibus.
