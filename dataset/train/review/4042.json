Repeatedly, readers apparently unfamiliar with Baton Rouge and New York City asked if the clip was footage from July 2016 protests held in the former location following the shooting death of Alton Sterling.", "In fact, July 2016 wasn't the first time this particular bit of footage caused both confusion and consternation.

A few weeks later, Dilello spoke to BuzzFeed about the then-viral video:", "In a phone interview, Dilello, who shot the video, told BuzzFeed News that he posted it to YouTube because, \u201cI had never heard a group of people chanting that kind of crap in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was totally unacceptable, especially in my street.\u201d", "After a FOX affiliate in Baltimore aired a video on Dec. 21 purporting to show another group chanting for dead cops \u2014 it turned out the video was edited inappropriately \u2014 many commenters on news sites like weekly Rockland Times and NBC News said they thought Dilello\u2019s video was doctored. Some protesters suggested to BuzzFeed News that Dilello was a plainclothes police officer. He denied both ideas, adding that he had received threats since posting the video.", "\u201cI am not a cop, I don\u2019t know any cops, nobody in my family is a cop,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. \u201cPeople think I manipulated the audio.

When George Zimmerman was on trial for the death of Trayvon Martin, Papcun\u2019s testimony was ultimately beneficial to Zimmerman.)", "\u201cI have listened to [the recording] with sophisticated audio equipment,\u201d Papcun said. \u201cBeyond a reasonable doubt, in my opinion, leaders chant, \u2018What do we want?\u2019 The crowd responds, \u2018Dead cops.\u2019 Then leaders chant, \u2018When do we want it?\u2019 The crowd responds, \u2018Now.\u2019\u201d", "Papcun said that he had been able to isolate one more phrase in the muddled audio at the beginning of the recording: \u201cShoot back.\u201d", "On 23 December 2014 (ten days after Dilello shared the video, and three days after the NYPD officers were ambushed), the Daily Beast attempted to drill down on who was responsible for the chanting. Their annotated article maintained that the New York chapter of the Trayvon Martin Organizing Committee (TMOC), who were unauthorized by the Martin family to use Trayvon's name or likeness, were the sole faction of marchers using the chant. The Daily Beast highlighted the use of a unique protest banner to connect TMOC with the December 2014 footage:", "An Instagram of that \u201cNo Cops No Prisons\u201d banner displays a number of hashtags, including #turnuptheanger, a hashtag associated with TMOC.

But you can\u2019t reduce the mass protests in New York to a call for killing police without ignoring how that particular message had to be smuggled in.", "Political factions obsessed with government saboteurs and false-flag operations had to conspire to manipulate the larger movement around them.

And if they did indeed march on Dec. 13, they did so long after the larger protest had moved downtown. They were not part of the main group.", "For one thing, according to the video, which was posted to Youtube the same day as the protest, the \u201cdead cops\u201d chant took place after sunset.

Presumably marchers move more slowly than individual pedestrians, making the chanters again unlikely offshoots from the official march that concluded three miles downtown:", "The clip in question involving chants about \"dead cops\" was shot in New York City in December 2014, but contemporaneous reporting widely and incorrectly identified its source as Black Lives Matter and Millions March demonstrations taking place in different parts of the city at different times.
