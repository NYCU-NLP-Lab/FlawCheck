That wasn\u2019t from us. That\u2019s been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world.\"", "Trump\u2019s assertion that the test \"wasn\u2019t from us,\" gets things backwards. There could be no test for the virus that causes COVID-19 until the virus emerged.", "Trump\u2019s claim that his administration inherited a broken test \"doesn\u2019t make sense,\" said infectious disease researcher Christopher Mores at George Washington University\u2019s School of Public Health.", "\"The (Centers for Disease Control) designed it and validated it and deployed it,\" Mores said. \"It has since been found to have multiple problems and has been changed to address some of these.\"", "China officially reported the new disease Dec. 31, 2019.

But there was a hitch. The tests needed clean reagents, chemicals essential to providing reliable results. Some of the reagents were tainted and states had to send their samples to be tested back to the CDC.", "All of this cost public health officials precious time learning how far the coronavirus had spread. By mid February, CDC and state labs had tested just under 2,200 samples. This was at a time when South Korea had performed over 7,900 tests.", "According to the COVID Tracking Project, by March 29, the country had conducted more than 831,000 tests.", "Trump has incorrectly blamed the Obama administration for creating a policy that hamstrung the development of a testing regime. It is true that Food and Drug Administration rules slowed the process for private labs, but that practice dated back to the days of the President George W. Bush administration. Trump also falsely said the WHO had a bad test. Three independent labs validated that test.", "We asked the White House how a previous administration could be responsible for a test created three years into the Trump presidency.
