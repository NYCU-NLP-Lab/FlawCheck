Khaladzhi holds dozens of titles in the Ukrainian Book of Records, but we were unable to locate any of his feats of strength listed on the Guinness Book of World Records' web site.", "A biography on the web site for the film Ivan the Powerful (Khaladzhi played title character Ivan Firtsak) provided some more information about the strong man:", "At age 15 he became the champion of Ukraine in hand-to-hand combat. Later he won the title of Ukrainian champion in folk wrestling, the title \"Strongest in Donbass\", eventually became the record holder of the Guinness Book of Records of Ukraine and Russia.", "\ufeff", "The video of a man carrying a horse is real.
