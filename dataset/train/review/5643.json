["About this rating", "A striking photograph purportedly showing several large whales gathered around a small fishing boat is frequently shared on social media:", "This image is, however, a composite of at least two different pictures.", "The original photograph, showing just the whales, was taken by photographer Scott Methvin and uploaded to his Facebook page on 6 January 2016, and the boat was added to the foreground later:", "While Methvin didn't initially post the image with a message informing viewers that it had been digitally altered, he did post a follow-up photograph showing how a boat would actually look next to the whales:", "No Photoshop, real scale.", "When another Facebook page shared the image and attributed it to a different photographer, Methvin chimed in to claim ownership of the photograph, explaining how and why he created the image:", "This is my PHOTOSHOPPED image. Someone took my name off of it. I did it for fun and took two photos and combined them. The (other photographer) grabbed it from a mutual \"friend.\" The scale is rediculous and was funny to me, so I made it. It is actually my first PS composite I ever made. Given the viral nature of this image, maybe I should make some more and do a cleaner job.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
