It features a two-headed eagle similar to Russia's coat of arms instead of the American single-headed bald eagle, golf clubs instead of arrows, and the phrase \"45 es un titere\u201d (which translates to \"45 is a puppet\") instead of the traditional United States motto \"e pluribus unum\" (\"out of many, one\").", "Several photographs of Trump with this fake presidential seal are available via Getty Images.

He said the mistake was \"unacceptable.\"", "\"We did let the individual go,\" the spokesman said. \"I don't think it was malicious intent, but nevertheless.\"", "Leazott doesn't buy it. He thinks whoever was responsible had to know exactly what they were looking for. He believes the person dug up the image he created and used it intentionally.", "\"That's a load of crap,\" he said in response to Turning Point's explanation. \"You have to look for this. There's no way this was an accident is all I'm saying.\"", "Here's a side-by-side comparison of the official presidential seal (right) and the fake version (left) displayed behind President Trump during his speech:", "Leazott also expressed that he was pleased with the mix-up, whether it was deliberate or accidental:", "A photo of Trump in front of his seal is now [Leazott's] computer background, and the person who used it at the event is \"either wildly incompetent or the best troll ever -- either way, I love them.\"", "\" ...
