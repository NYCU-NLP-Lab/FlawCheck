The posts were flagged as being potentially fabricated by Facebook, as part of its efforts to crack down on made-up Internet posts masquerading as true information.", "This one, keyed off Streep\u2019s acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding achievement at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, is as fictional as any Hollywood creation.", "Streep did excoriate then-President-elect Trump\u2019s policies and past actions in her speech, without ever mentioning his name. She said she was stunned when Trump imitated a disabled reporter, a claim Trump has falsely denied.", "Trump took to Twitter the next day to lambast Streep for criticizing him, calling her \"over-rated\" and a \"Hillary flunky,\" again denying he mocked a reporter.", "Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.

Don't make this into the WWF which is fun but not presidential", "The article is pretty light on most details, such as whether this was to be a TV series or a film, but Streep was allegedly going to play Mrs. Cunningham.
