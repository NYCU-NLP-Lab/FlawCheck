["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 12, 2018", "Q: Was former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn recently cleared by the FBI in the Russia probe?", "A: No. A website makes that claim based on an outdated news story that was published prior to Flynn pleading guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his conversations with a top Russian official.", "The website of anti-Islamic activist Pamela Geller reposted an outdated story that says the \u201cFBI clears\u201d retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn \u2014 President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. It has not.\u00a0Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his post-election conversations with a top Russian government official.", "The Geller Report published an item on Nov. 5 that begins: \u201cIt was all a big fat lie \u2014 a coup against the President that continues to this very day. But the real criminals \u2014 Hillary Clinton and co. \u2014 escape justice.\u201d The next three paragraphs are identical to a Jan. 24, 2017, story in the New York Post that carried the headline, \u201cFBI clears Michael Flynn in probe linking him to Russia.\u201d The Geller Report used the same headline.", "But Geller disregards developments that have occurred since the New York Post story appeared nearly 22 months ago.", "That\u00a0New York Post story was based on\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0article\u00a0from a day earlier that said FBI agents investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election had \u201creviewed intercepts of communications\u201d in December 2016 between Flynn, then an adviser to the president-elect, and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the time. Citing U.S. officials, the Washington\u00a0Post reported that the FBI \u201chas not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government.\u201d", "However, a day after the Washington Post published its story, the FBI\u00a0interviewed Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak. And months later, on Dec. 1, 2017, the special counsel\u2019s office announced that Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents during that interview, as we\u2019ve explained in our article about \u201cMichael Flynn\u2019s Russia Timeline.\u201d", "During a Dec. 22, 2016, call with Kislyak, according to the special counsel\u2019s office, Flynn asked Russia to delay or defeat a U.N. Security Council resolution \u2014 something Flynn initially denied to the FBI. In another call, seven days later, Flynn discussed sanctions the Obama administration placed on Russia for its interference in the election. The special counsel\u2019s office said\u00a0that Flynn asked Russia to refrain from escalating the situation; Kislyak agreed that Russia would \u201cmoderate its response to those sanctions\u201d following the request. When interviewed about that second call by the FBI, Flynn denied making that request and couldn\u2019t recall if Kislyak had agreed to it.", "When Flynn agreed to plead guilty for lying about those conversations, he said in a statement that he would cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. He is scheduled to be sentenced next month.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Geller, Pamela. \u201cFBI clears Michael Flynn in probe linking him to Russia.\u201d Geller Report. 5 Nov 2018.", "Kiely, Eugene. \u201cMichael Flynn\u2019s Russia Timeline.\u201d FactCheck.org. 1 Dec 2017.", "Order No. 3915-2017: Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters.
