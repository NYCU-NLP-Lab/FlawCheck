["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Gov. Nathan Deal is trying to turn the Ga. 400 toll from a symbol of broken promises to one of promises kept.\n\nCommuters fumed in 2010 when state officials reneged on a pledge to end the 50-cent toll by the following year. Instead, they extended it to 2020. Some blame this move for sealing the fate of the failed bid to raise taxes to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta.\n\nDeal, then vying for the governor\u2019s seat, seized on the issue. He promised voters he\u2019d tear down the toll by the end of 2011.\n\nThe tollbooths still stand, but now Deal\u2019s recent announcement that the toll will come down during his term has him crowing that he kept his campaign pledge.\n\n\"Fulfilling his promise to commuters, Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that he will have the state pay off its bond debt on Dec. 1, 2013, and move rapidly after that to remove the Ga. 400 toll by the end of that year,\" Deal\u2019s office announced in a news release July 19.\n\nThis perplexed us. Late last year, Deal earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter for failing to meet the 2011 deadline.\n\nDid we miss something? We put Deal\u2019s claim that he fulfilled his promise on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s review Deal\u2019s original pledge.\n\nOn June 22, 2010, his campaign issued a news release that said \"he'll move quickly as governor to bring down the Georgia 400 toll before the end of 2011.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The state has collected more than enough money to pay for the bonds for the highway,\" Deal said in the statement. \"We are now using the tolls of Georgia 400 drivers to pay for other road projects. That\u2019s not fair to the commuters in north Fulton and Forsyth counties. They\u2019ve carried more than their fair share.\"\n\nDeal\u2019s resolve waned in the coming months.\n\nBy the time Deal took office in January 2011, the State Road and Tollway Authority Board had already sold $40 million in bonds based on the revenue expected from the newly extended toll.\n\nEnding the toll \"would be an abrogation of a contract,\" the governor\u2019s spokesman, Brian Robinson, told PolitiFact Georgia in 2011.\n\nRobinson did not return repeated requests for comment on this article.\n\nThe feud over the Ga. 400 toll became a flash point during the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s unsuccessful referendum on a regional penny-per-dollar sales tax to overhaul metro Atlanta\u2019s traffic-snarled transportation system.\n\nDeal backed the tax, which would have expired in 10 years or less.\n\nBut tax foes said that the Ga. 400 flap was proof that the government couldn\u2019t be trusted with transportation dollars.\n\nPolls showed the tax measure flagging in the polls. Twelve days before the election, Deal announced that the state would pay off the $40 million in new bonds by Dec. 1, 2013. The tollbooths would come down soon afterward.\n\n\"When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasn\u2019t forever,\" his recent news release said. \"If we don\u2019t keep that promise, we lose the faith of the people.\"\n\nDeal\u2019s gambit did little for the transportation tax. More than 60 percent of voters in the Atlanta region rejected it Tuesday, according to the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\n\nDid Deal really fulfill his promise to commuters on Ga. 400?\n\nWhen Deal promised to bring down the toll, he gave himself a deadline: \"before the end of 2011,\" as a campaign news release stated.\n\nThis new plan misses the original deadline by a full two years. That means Ga. 400 motorists will still be paying tolls much longer than they were originally promised.\n\nDeal failed to meet a date of his own making. But he has come up with a plan to eliminate the tolls, albeit on a deadline not addressed in his original campaign promise.\n\nDeal earns a Mostly False on this one.", "Office of Gov.
