The speech can be viewed, translated to English, here:", "\"Germany,\" as a country, did not release an official statement to the world \"denouncing\" its ally the United States. Instead, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel gave a speech on 5 December 2017 before government officials in Berlin, which was basically a call to recognize what many in Europe already know \u2014 the global order that had been in place since World War II is shifting, in part because the United States is retreating from it under the leadership of President Donald Trump.", "Although Gabriel said that the view of the United States as being \"protective\" is \"crumbling away,\" he stressed:", "Still the United States will have to be our main international partner, there is no doubt we will need and also maintain this partnership. However, this partnership alone will not be sufficient to actually maintain our strategic interests.", "Gabriel said Germany must adopt a more independent position and prioritize its own interests when necessary, as opposed to deferring to Washington. He also said the European Union should be poised to project power, as other nation-states like Russia and China have rushed to fill the void of international leadership left by the United States. As it stands, he said, Europe is viewed as wealthy, but weak.", "There is no doubt that President Trump's words and actions since taking office have resulted in the cooling of what has been a close alliance for roughly seven decades. His first foreign trip as President to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) headquarters in May 2017 left European leaders feeling shaken about the reliability of the U.S. going forward. Immediately following Trump's visit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave a speech saying that Germany and other European countries couldn't rely on \"others\" anymore \u2014 a statement widely read to mean that longstanding transatlantic ties had quickly frayed.", "During the May trip, President Trump lambasted European allies, insisting they needed to pay more into defense spending (with reports circulating that he even gave Merkel a hand-written \"bill\" for an unknown sum of money that Germany allegedly \"owed\"). During a closely-watched speech he failed to commit to Article 5 -- a key mutual aid agreement \u2014 although he did so during a speech in Warsaw in July. Nevertheless, as Gabriel's speech signaled, Europeans are accepting a reality that their alliances with the U.S. may be more conditional than in the past, and the continent must now navigate a world without the leadership it once had from across the Atlantic.", "Eddy, Melissa. \u00a0 \"In Era of Trump, Germany Seeks a Stronger Role Abroad.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 5 December 2017.", "Birnbaum, Michael and Rick Noack. \u00a0 \"Following Trump\u2019s Trip, Merkel Says Europe Can\u2019t Rely on \u2018Others.\u2019 She Means the U.S.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 28 May 2017.", "Frum, David. \u00a0 \"Trump's Trip Was a Catastrophe for U.S.-Europe Relations.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Atlantic. \u00a0 25 May 2017.", "Berger, Deidre et al.\u00a0\"In Spite of It All, America.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times (Translated from German to English, first published in the German newspaper Die Zeit).\u00a0 11 October 2017.", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
