Even broken-down boilers and collapsing roofs are not being fixed.\n\nDavid Sciarra, executive director of the Newark-based Education Law Center, made that claim while criticizing the New Jersey Schools Development Authority during his Jan. 5 testimony before the Assembly Budget Committee.\n\n\"These kids are trapped in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe schools every day, because (of) the school construction shut down now entering its third year. And even worse, the SDA has now \u2013 I have to say this \u2013 two years of shut down, the SDA is close to spending $90 million over the last two years on staff and overhead, many high-priced employees sitting down the street, literally doing nothing,\" Sciarra told the legislators.\n\n\"Nothing. They have not started or completed one single school project, and I\u2019m not talking about major school renovation,\" Sciarra continued. \"I\u2019m talking about replacing boilers, roofs.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that school officials across New Jersey have been frustrated with the SDA over stalled projects, but PolitiFact New Jersey found that Sciarra is still out of line to claim that \"nothing\" has been done to address emergency repairs.\n\nThe authority, which manages most projects in the 31 former Abbott districts, substantially completed 27 SDA-managed emergent projects during the past two years, including repairs on roofs, exterior masonry and boilers, according to SDA spokeswoman Andrea Pasquine.\n\n\"Mr. Sciarra\u2019s statement is patently untrue,\" Pasquine said in an email.\n\nKristen MacLean, the authority\u2019s director of communications, said those 27 projects were first identified by districts prior to Gov. Chris Christie taking office in January 2010, but the administration expedited the work.\n\nSciarra, whose organization represents students in the former Abbott districts, acknowledged in an email that projects started before the Christie administration have been completed. But he said it\u2019s \"a virtual \u2018drop in the bucket\u2019 when compared to the hundreds of health and safety emergency projects and the major projects stopped by the Governor's shut down.\"\n\nSciarra accused us of putting a \"political spin\" on his statement and advancing a \"political agenda.\"\n\nNow, let\u2019s mention some specific projects in Newark and Camden.\n\nIn Newark, construction was substantially completed in 2011 on nine SDA-managed emergent projects, according to Steve Morlino, executive director of facilities management for Newark Public Schools.\n\nThose projects included roofing work at BRICK Avon Academy; Dr. William H. Horton School; and South Street School, according to a list provided by Morlino.\n\nWendy Kunz, Director of Abbott Facilities Construction for the Camden school district, also pointed to a few emergent projects completed during the past two years, including replacing the roof and Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning units in 2011 at R.C. Molina Elementary School.\n\nBut those and other former Abbott districts have not received approval for hundreds of other proposed emergency repairs. Newark school officials proposed work on more than 130 emergent conditions, but they have not been approved yet to go to construction, Morlino said.\n\nFollowing site visits, state officials are reviewing 300 emergent conditions identified by the former Abbott districts, Pasquine said. The districts identified more than 700 emergent conditions, but 400 of them were preliminarily rejected by the state Department of Education for not meeting the established criteria, she said.\n\n\"The results of the site visits are currently under review to identify which conditions warrant advancement as emergent projects,\" Pasquine said in the email. \"Additionally, SDA and DOE are developing a strategy for advancing those emergent conditions that require attention.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSciarra claimed authority employees \"have not started or completed one single school project,\" including \"replacing boilers, roofs.\"\n\nHundreds of emergency repairs proposed by school officials have not been approved yet, but the authority has substantially completed other projects during the past two years, including work in Newark and Camden.\n\nOf course, Sciarra and school officials want more done, but claiming \"nothing\" has happened is wrong.
