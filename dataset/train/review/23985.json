News of the sort described in the posts seemed difficult to suppress, as the families of the three women missing (but not confirmed dead) would be searching for their loved ones.", "None of the missing or deceased women were named in the post, nor were details given about the circumstances under which all five had purportedly disappeared. The warning also didn't disclose the identities of the two women it claimed were found dead, and the only information specifying location held that \"one woman left for work to Valley Children's Hospital\" and hadn't been seen alive since.", "Information published on 11 June 2016 by the Fresno County Sheriff's Department stated that one woman was found dead inside her vehicle, and that preliminary findings indicated they believed nothing criminal had occurred in the circumstances under investigation:", "Members of the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office Crime Scene Unit have identified Alicia Haro, 47, of Fresno as the victim in a suspicious death investigation.", "Haro was reported as a missing person to the Fresno Police Department on Thursday, June 9th.", "Around 7:30 pm on Friday, a Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy responded to a call on E.

The deputy determined the woman was deceased and homicide detectives responded to begin an investigation.", "Preliminary results show nothing criminal took place to result in Haro\u2019s death. An autopsy and toxicology tests are pending to determine an exact cause of death.", "Haro went missing on 9 June 2016, and was found dead in her vehicle on 10 June 2016; the warning circulated on 15 June 2016. No further instances of open missing persons cases nor suspicious deaths were reported in the region.", "The Tulare County Sheriff didn't maintain a page of such releases, but a coroner's page listed recent deaths in the jurisdiction. All causes of death from 9 June 2016 onward were listed as \"Natural,\" not suspicious.
