But we wondered whether Wittman gave the canines too much credit in claiming each one averages saving 150 to 200 lives during their careers.", "Farahn Morgan, the congressman\u2019s press secretary, told us Wittman got the figure from the American Humane Association.", "She provided a news release the organization sent in June 2015. It praised Congress for passing legislation that allows the military to fly service dogs back to the U.S. after retirement to be reunited with their handlers or adopted. Transportation previously had been handled by private fundraising organizations, including the humane association.", "\"The nation\u2019s military working dogs, each of whom saves the lives of between 150-200 servicemen and women in the course of their career, are one step closer to being guaranteed treatment as the heroes they are,\" the humane association news release began.", "We asked the humane association for its source of the statistic.

Many of them are trained as bomb sniffers.", "\"Most of our explosive-detecting (dogs) have never found anything except explosive training aids because they have never encountered a live explosive device,\" he said.", "\"Those that have found devices were actually conducting deployed operations at the time in (Afghanistan or Iraq). For those that are found, the typical device in a roadway or building would kill far fewer people than 150 people. As such, the (dog) would need to find several devices or bomb-making components to reach the 150-200 number and that would only apply to very few dogs.\"", "Pahon said that while the contributions of the bomb sniffers are not quantifiable, \"they are an invaluable asset for freedom of movement of our ground patrols.\"", "He added that many of the dogs aren\u2019t bomb sniffers but are trained to detect drugs or walk patrols. \"These are critical duties that are not directly life-saving, but contribute to overall mission success and safety,\" Pahon wrote.", "Our ruling", "Wittman said, \"On average, each U.S. military working dog saves the lives of between 150 and 200 servicemen and women over the span of his career.\"", "This is a myth that\u2019s been spread for years, often by organizations promoting the adoption of retired military dogs.
