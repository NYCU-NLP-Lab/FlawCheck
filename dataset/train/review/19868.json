["\u201cIs it possible Wayfair involved in Human trafficking with their WFX Utility collection? Or are these just extremely overpriced cabinets?\u201d asked Reddit user PrincessPeach1987 on the discussion website\u2019s section dedicated to conspiracy theories, r/conspiracy, on July 9, 2020.", "\u201cNote the names of the cabinets,\u201d the user added in the post, which features a screenshot of the online retailer\u2019s website showing four storage cabinets priced between $12,699 and $14,499. The cupboards are named Neriah, Yaritza, Samiyah and Alyvia.", "Despite the absence of any evidence, social media users quickly appropriated and added to the conspiracy theory, claiming on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok that specific children were being sold online under the guise of overpriced household items.", "However, the claim is nothing more than a hoax.", "\u201cThere is, of course, no truth to these claims,\u201d Jane Carpenter, a Wayfair spokeswoman, told AFP by email.", "\u201cThe products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced,\u201d she explained, adding that they have been temporarily removed from the site to rename them and clarify the reason for the high pricing.", "Carpenter told AFP that an algorithm names the products available on the website.", "\u201cThat algorithm uses first names, geographic locations, and common words for naming purposes, which is why some of the products in question are named with human first names,\u201d she said, adding that the practice is common in retail.", "After the claim was posted on Reddit, other social media users tied various products available on Wayfair to the names of children who have allegedly disappeared in the US.

It\u2019s an old post that someone is circulating and she is aware of it. She is perfectly fine,\u201d Doss said, adding that Dunning did run away as a teenager, and the old missing status is circulating again.", "Samara Duplessis, a Michigan teenager reported missing on May 7, also had her name used to support the conspiracy theory. However, she had been found before it emerged, her mother announced in a Facebook post on May 10.", "Others mentioned in the claims include Maryland\u2019s Cameron James Dziedzic, reported missing on March 10.
