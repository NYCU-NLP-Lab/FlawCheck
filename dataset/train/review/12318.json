A representative of Westbury's parent company, Arla Foods UK, confirmed to us by email that the rumor is false.", "\"Please be assured this is a hoax in very poor taste,\" the company's consumer relations department said.", "Unsurprisingly, a search of the BBC News web site turned up no articles or videos reporting that butter or any other dairy product in the U.K. was contaminated with HIV-infected blood, or that anyone was arrested by police for doing such a thing.

Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.", "Though it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person.
