["A viral meme shared on Facebook displays the \"28th Amendment\" to the Constitution, which apparently bars Congress from enacting laws that don\u2019t apply to them but apply to the rest of the U.S. population.", "There\u2019s just one tiny snag: The Constitution only has 27 Amendments.", "Despite the fabrication, the meme has been shared over 74,000 times since October 22, 2019.", "Under the title \"Amendment 28\" the meme\u2019s text reads:", "\"Congress shall make no law that applies to its citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives: and, Congress shall make no law that applies to Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States.\"", "Above that, it says: \"The 28th Amendment hasn\u2019t been held up in years.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Rand Paul of Kentucky submitted a joint resolution that proposed an amendment to the Constitution with wording that was almost identical to the post. It read: \"Congress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress.\"", "The bill never made it out of committee and failed again when it was reintroduced in the Senate the following year. Similar proposals introduced in the House around the same time also failed.", "We rate this Pants on Fire!", "Facebook post, Oct. 22, 2019", "GovInfo.gov, Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, Accessed Dec. 11, 2019", "FactCheck.org.
