Their homes were next to each other \u2014 thus they went to each other\u2019s homes despite containment.\u201d", "Since then the media has reported \u2014", "1. 26-members from a family were infected in Jahangirpuri, quoting CM Kejriwal [The Free Press Journal, Hindustan Times, The Outlook(IANS syndicated copy) and NDTV]", "2. 31 people tested positive in Jahangirpuri out of which 26 members were from one family [Scroll, The Indian Express and Kalinga TV(IANS syndicated copy)]", "3. 31 members of an extended family tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri [India Today (PTI syndicated copy) and ABP News]", "On April 19, The Indian Express reported 60 samples were taken as part of the government\u2019s community testing efforts in Jahangirpuri, a coronavirus hotspot. Out of these, 31 people tested positive, including 26 from the same family.", "As per the report, the source of the infection was a 60-year-old woman who succumbed to coronavirus on April 5. As per the sources in the health department, the 26-member family are relatives of the elderly woman.", "On April 18, North District Magistrate Shinde Deepak Arjun told ANI, \u201cThese 31 people, who were tested positive with COVID-19, are either members of the family of an old woman who died after being infected with coronavirus or have visited her.\u201d It is pertinent to note that Arjun did not state that a 26-member family was infected.", "On April 22, The Print published a ground report from Jahangirpuri.

This was until 5 pm, April 5 when he lost his 52-year-old mother: \u201cMy mother hasn\u2019t been healthy for the past 10 years. But the pain and discomfort she experienced in the days leading up to her death were unlike anything she had had to bear.\u201d", "Alt News has a copy of Ajiman Bibi\u2019s Aadhaar card which states she was born in 1968. Thus, the media had botched-up Ajiman Bibi\u2019s age as well.", "Mohammed, who works as an electrician, informed, \u201cSince March 30, my mother had a fever and trouble breathing. We visited three different hospitals multiple times on April 3 and April 4; none of them bothered to test her for coronavirus.\u201d Mohammed and his family are a resident of ward 21, Jahangirpuri.", "State failure: Why wasn\u2019t Ajiman Bibi tested for coronavirus when she was alive and showed symptoms?", "According to Mohammed, he took his mother for a health check-up to the following hospitals on April 3 and 4 \u2014 Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital, Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Rajan Babu TB Hospital and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.

The image below shows a form of the Department of Radiodiagnosis at Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital on April 3.", "Despite having the symptoms for coronavirus, according to Mohammed, the government hospitals didn\u2019t test his mother when she was alive.

As per this document, Ajiman Bibi\u2019s coronavirus test report arrived on April 7. So why did Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital allow Mohammed\u2019s family to take Ajiman Bibi\u2019s dead body on April 5? That has severely put my ward at risk.\u201d", "Alt News has a copy of the said document. It is pertinent to note that Block \u2018B\u2019 Jahangirpuri was one of the first 22 containment zones in Delhi announced on April 8. Block \u2018C\u2019 (Ajiman Bibi\u2019s block) was also added to the list on April 10, once the authorities realised Ajiman Bibi had tested positive.", "On April 10, Noor collected his mother\u2019s reports from Dr RML Hospital which confirmed that she was coronavirus positive. \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder, why did the hospital allow us to take her home if they were yet to confirm that she had contracted the infection,\u201d questioned Noor.", "How many family members does Noor have?", "Mohammed and his family have been quarantined since April 10 at Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats in Narela. \u201cMy family includes \u2014 my father, uncle, five brothers (of which three are married), three women and five children,\u201d he said.

The remaining seven are in a different building where people who have tested positive are quarantined,\u201d said Noor who has tested negative.", "According to Noor, out of the seven \u2014 six have tested positive. \u201cThe seventh member, who tested negative, is my sister-in-law\u2019s baby. My sister-in-law tested positive but since the baby needs to be breastfed, she insisted to keep the baby in her custody.\u201d Noor pointed out doctors have not given a hard copy of their test results.", "A Delhi-based journalist (identity concealed at request) shared an image of an excel sheet with Alt News that was provided by a government official. The document lists the names, ages and addresses of 31 people from Jahangirpuri who tested positive. Alt News has attached the image after concealing personal details.", "Noor said, \u201cSince I work as an electrician in the area, I know all 31 people on the list. In fact, I must have visited their house at some point in the past. Out of the 31, 13 are a part of my extended family.\u201d Noor informed that the 13 members from his extended family include his sister and her in-laws.

At that time, none of them was aware that Ajiman Bibi (wrongly spelt in the list as \u2018Ajeewan\u2019) was infected with coronavirus.", "Simply put, six members of Noor\u2019s immediate family have tested positive and 13 members of his extended family (sister and her in-laws) have tested positive. Since the hospital hasn\u2019t provided the test reports to Noor, we were unable to independently verify the results. However, it is clear that 26 members of a single-family did not test positive.", "Additionally, municipal councillor Bagri also confirmed that the 31-member list does not include a 26-member family. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why CM Kejriwal felt the need to highlight the 26-member family despite the data collected shows no such family,\u201d she said.", "Delhi CM Kejriwal\u2019s statement that a 26-member family was tested positive for coronavirus in Jahangirpuri was therefore inaccurate. The media was also at fault for not verifying the data and instead, sensationalising that a 26-member family tested positive. Kejriwal blamed the family for not adhering to lockdown guidelines. The media failed to report that Noor took his mother, Ajiman Bibi, to multiple hospitals and despite showing symptoms she was neither admitted nor tested until it was too late. Dr RML Hospital allowed the family to take Ajiman Bibi\u2019s dead body home without first confirming if she had the infection. The family held a funeral which was attended by several people. Inaccurate media reports overlooked the state\u2019s failure and held the family responsible for contracting the infection.", "On April 18, Twitter account @India_Policy, which claims to inform on topics related to public policy and governance, tweeted, \u201c#BREAKING : 26 members of a single family found #COVID19 positive in Jahangirpuri area of Delhi, including Husband, his 2 wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more\u2026\u201d(archive link)", "@India_Policy has over one lakh followers and its post was retweeted by 3,500 people.

The article said, \u201cNot only does this development serve as a clarion call for the government to bring in legislation on the lines of a population control bill, but it is all the more reason as to why a Uniform Civil Code is the need of the hour. How can anyone have 19 children, even if from different wives?\u201d (archive link)", "Alt News also found that there is a WhatsApp image being circulated based on @India_Policy\u2019s tweet.", "Just like the media reports, social media latched on \u201c26-member family\u201d to target the Muslim community. Noor confirmed that no one from his family or extended family has engaged in polygamy.
