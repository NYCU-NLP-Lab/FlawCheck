["By Robert Farley", "Posted on October 8, 2020", "Less than a week after being hospitalized due to COVID-19, President Donald Trump now says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m contagious at all.\u201d But according to medical experts and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the president may very well still be contagious and ought to be isolated.", "In a phone interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business on the morning of Oct. 8, Trump said he was feeling good and looking forward to resuming campaign rallies.", "\u201cI think I\u2019m better to a point where I\u2019d love to do a rally tonight, I wanted to do one last night, but I think I\u2019m better to a point that I feel better than I did you know, I jokingly said 20 years ago, I feel perfect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong. I had a case, I got it knocked out.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m contagious at all,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWell, first of all, if I\u2019m at a rally I\u2019d stand by myself very far away from everybody, whether I was or not. But I still wouldn\u2019t go to rally if I was contagious.\u201d", "Trump may not think he is contagious, but according to the CDC \u201cpersons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset.\u201d People with more severe illness may be infectious longer than that.", "The CDC recommends that, \u201cFor most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.\u201d", "Trump announced very early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus. In a press conference later that morning, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing \u201cmild symptoms.\u201d Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed\u00a0National Military\u00a0Medical Center, where he spent three days getting treatment before being discharged back to the White House on Oct. 5.", "In an Oct. 7 memo, Trump\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said the president has \u201cnow been fever-free for more than 4 days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed or received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization.\u201d", "Still, Trump\u2019s statement that he no longer believed he was contagious came just seven days after he first began to experience symptoms. In an interview on MSNBC, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the president\u2019s pronouncement was premature.", "\u201cWell, you know the general guideline from the CDC says that 10 days from the onset of symptoms, that you can essentially consider someone noninfectious,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cYou can definitively show that by another one of the recommendations that had been made about two negative PCR tests, 24 hours apart. So if the president goes 10 days without symptoms and they do the test that we were talking about, then you could make the assumption, based on good science, that he is not infected. But you just have to wait and make sure you go through those particular benchmarks that are delineated in the CDC guidelines.\u201d", "In a press call on Oct. 7, the day before Trump said he thought he was no longer infectious, Dr. Roger Shapiro, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that patients with \u201cmild or even moderate disease\u201d may be \u201crendered non-infectious in about 10 days just by natural course of the illness and immune control that would be expected for most individuals.\u201d", "\u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople with more severe disease can remain infectious for 20 days or even longer.\u201d", "There is \u201ca real possibility\u201d Trump fits in that latter category, Shapiro said, \u201cand it might be made even greater by the fact that President Trump received steroids.\u201d Steroids, he added, can be \u201cvery helpful in reducing mortality, especially late in the illness,\u201d but \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know the effect that they may have in terms of prolonging the shedding of virus.\u201d", "On Oct. 4, Conley said that Trump had experienced \u201ctwo episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation,\u201d indicating Trump\u2019s lungs may be compromised. As a result, the president began to take dexamethasone, a steroid drug.", "\u201cIt really depends on how severe his COVID is,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cAnd that is a matter of some debate right now. \u2026 It is unclear whether he is in a more moderate category or whether he really tipped over towards a severe disease, which would be suggested by the fact that he received the dexamethasone for his illness.\u201d", "\u201cSo I think it\u2019s still is a real unknown as to whether or not, President Trump will be shedding virus in the middle of next week,\u201d Shapiro said.", "Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, told CNBC the president\u2019s comments are \u201ctruly unbelievable\u201d and the fact that he is considering holding a rally is \u201cmind blowing.\u201d", "\u201cJust less than a week ago, the president was in a hospital being treated for severe illness,\u201d said Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that he\u2019s still shedding virus right now.\u201d", "Dr. Syra Madad, senior director of the systemwide special pathogens program at New York City Health + Hospitals, told CNBC the president ought to isolate for at least 10 days, per the evidence-based CDC guidance.", "\u201cIf [Trump\u2019s] not going to isolate for that full period when he may be infectious, then, as a doctor, why would we tell other people to do the same,\u201d Madad said. \u201cWhy should they listen to us when the president of the United States isn\u2019t abiding by his own public health measures?\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
