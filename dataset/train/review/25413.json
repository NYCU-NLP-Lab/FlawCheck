The No on Prop 64 campaign was ordered to change claims similar to Feinstein\u2019s statement at the center of this fact check. Claims such as \"marijuana smoking ads will be legal on all broadcast primetime shows\" were dialed back to \"could be allowed.\" On the Yes on 64 side, however, the judge ruled there should be \"No change\" to that campaign\u2019s statement that \"Nothing in 64 makes it legal to show marijuana ads on TV. Federal law prohibits it!\" We continue to view Feinstein\u2019s claim that Prop 64 \"allows\" recreational marijuana ads on TV as misleading. Had the senator said Prop 64 could open the door, someday, to recreational marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate. We continue to rate her statement Mostly False.", "Californians will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Proposition 64, a much-debated measure on the state\u2019s ballot.", "U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, who opposes Prop 64, says a green light for the initiative could strip away advertising rules and dramatically change what\u2019s seen on TV.", "Prop 64 \"allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers,\" Feinstein said on July 12, 2016, in a No On Prop. 64 campaign press release.", "We know Prop 64 would allow Californians to legally smoke pot in their homes, yards and possibly in designated shops where it\u2019s sold and regulated.", "But would it also lead to marijuana ads on \"prime time\" TV? Or is Feinstein blowing smoke? We decided to fact-check the senator\u2019s statement.", "Half-baked claim?", "Prop 64 is backed by Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Democratic Party. Recreational marijuana is already legal in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. Several states in addition to California are set to decide on legalizing pot in November.", "Feinstein\u2019s office did not expand on her statement. Instead, it referred us to the No On Prop. 64 campaign.", "The campaign pointed us to Prop 64\u2019s chapter on advertising and marketing restrictions, specifically Section 26151.", "It states: \"Any advertising or marketing placed in broadcast, cable, radio, print and digital communications shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up-to-date audience composition data.\"", "Wayne Johnson, spokesman for No On Prop. 64, said the 71.6 percent threshold is so low that only a few shows, such as Saturday morning cartoons, would be prohibited from airing marijuana ads.", "\"It\u2019s a ridiculous standard,\" Johnson said. \"It only applies to the tiniest handful of shows.\"", "In this photo taken on Thursday, May 26, 2016, Sarah Seiter, curator of the exhibit \"Altered State: Marijuana in California\" handles a cannabis leaf with gloved hands at the Oakland Museum in Oakland, Calif. \u00a0Ben Margot / AP", "Claim ignores federal law", "TV and legal experts say Feinstein\u2019s statement ignores federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal drug and prohibits advertising it on television.", "\"If Prop 64 passes, nothing will change in terms of what radio and television stations can legally broadcast,\" said Joe Berry, president of the California Broadcasters Association. \"The federal government licenses the radio and TV stations in California. The federal government\u2019s position is that marijuana is an illegal substance. So, it\u2019s illegal to advertise that substance.\"", "Berry added: \"The stations themselves are federally licensed. So, there is a risk to the license for the station at license renewal.\"", "Experts said cable and satellite television services would likely be subject to similar restrictions.", "They point to Section 843 of the Controlled Substances Act, which specifically prohibits using \"communications facilities\" to transmit advertisements for the sale of Schedule I drugs, which includes marijuana, heroin and ecstasy, among others.

But it\u2019s unclear if, when and how much the law will change.", "Berman said California\u2019s provisions, if approved through Prop 64, could pave the way for advertising on TV, but only if the federal rules change first.", "\"It ain\u2019t happening anytime soon,\" he said. \"Certainly, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to automatically happen based on how California votes this fall.\"", "Our ruling", "California Democratic Sen.
