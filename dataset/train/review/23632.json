Mace began her answer by saying:", "\"I\u2019m kind of mixed on this. I\u2019m not a scientist, and I\u2019ve read science on both sides of this issue. To me, it\u2019s not clear cut. I know that here in downtown Charleston, we\u2019re seeing rising sea levels. And that could be a product of the climate, but that\u2019s also partially a product of the peninsula being largely built on landfill in many places.\"", "When the reporter followed up by asking Mace what she\u2019s not sure about, Mace said:", "\"So, if you look at the history of Earth, we\u2019ve had climate changes many times, over 130 times over millions of years. And so part of it might be man-made; part of it might be just natural environmental causes as part of the cycle of Earth.\"", "She added:", "\"I think it\u2019s more complicated than people really realize. You can\u2019t say one or the other when there\u2019s data on both sides of the issue. And I read about scientists that have flipped from one side to the other \u2014 both ways \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to understand and know which one is right.\"", "The Washington Examiner reported Sept. 11 that it asked Mace to clarify her position on climate change.", "Mace replied, according to the newspaper, that \"she is \u2018not a scientist\u2019 and acknowledged sea levels are rising, but whether it is caused by \u2018man-made\u2019 climate change or natural reasons is \u2018up for debate.\u2019\"", "In a questionnaire, the Post and Courier asked Cunningham and Mace: \"Do you believe in climate change?\" The answers were published Sept. 13, with Mace saying:", "\"I\u2019m not a scientist, but I do know we should consider all available data.

My opponent has said that the science is settled on this. Well, the science is never settled. Scientists will tell you that. I look at the issue from every angle and try to find a solution, as I\u2019ve done as a state lawmaker. Scientists once said the Earth was flat and it\u2019s not, and so these things are evolving, as well.\"", "At their second and final scheduled debate, on Oct. 7, Cunningham and Mace were asked about what has caused a recent rise in the sea level in the area and what they would do about it. Mace said:", "\"Our Earth has had over 130 climate changes over its history. We are facing great climate change. We\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of hurricanes, sea levels are rising.\"", "In response to Cunningham\u2019s attack, Mace\u2019s campaign cited to PolitiFact an article published Oct. 14 in the Charleston City Paper. The newspaper said it asked Mace if humans are causing climate change, and she responded:", "\"Does man contribute to it? I mean, a lot of the science says that,\u00a0 too, but I want to stay informed and do as much as we can, but the other thing that\u2019s important to me is that we just cannot simply rely on the United States (to address it).\"", "Cunningham\u2019s claim that Mace \"denies climate change\" is accurate, but needs some clarification.
