It\u2019s held each year in October and draws as many as 70,000 people to downtown Keene.

Funding came from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through a grant managed by the New Hampshire Department of Safety.", "During public meetings leading up to the purchase, it appears there was little conversation about the threat of terrorism in southern New Hampshire. The discussion centered mainly around how the vehicle would be deployed during routine law enforcement procedures, such as evacuating residents during a flood or policing the campus of Keene State College.", "\"The original reason for filing the grant application was to acquire the piece of equipment in case there was some kind of crisis -- some kind of emergency that required the use of that type of equipment,\" said Keene Mayor Kendall Lane, who was serving on the city council at the time.", "He said in his recollection, the BearCat has been deployed only twice since it was acquired. In both instances, police were dealing with potentially armed subjects.", "Lane said Keene didn't cite the Pumpkin Fest as the only reason to get the BearCat, and for that reason, he believes Oliver\u2019s bit was a little misleading.", "\"It was humorous, but you know, the implication was that the Pumpkin Fest attracts a few hundred people in a rural part of America that would never be subject to a terrorist act.
