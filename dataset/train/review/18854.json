Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.", "The website, which doesn\u2019t list contact information and has hidden its registration data, attacked Waters, an African-American woman, for allegedly inciting racial strife and refusing to do her job.", "The writer, who is credited on the post as Sam Di Gangi, wrote:", "\"Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that 'Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.' \"", "The source is simply a Reddit thread from June 7, 2017, which contains no evidence at all.

As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991. That\u2019s higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate.", "The statistic also could mean all her committee meetings, but that isn\u2019t right, either. Of course, no member of Congress attends every single hearing, but the Washington Examiner did analyze meeting records for members of Congress in 2014.", "Waters was not among the 20 highest absentee rates, which was comprised of 12 Republicans and eight Democrats.
