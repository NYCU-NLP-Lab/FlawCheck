But he quickly launched into an attack on Colorado Springs Fire Marshal Brett Lacey.", "\"This is why our country doesn't work,\" Trump said. \"We have thousands of people in (an overflow) room next door. We have plenty of space here. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. And we have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people.' ... And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing.\"", "Trump continued to blame the fire marshal for the \"disgraceful situation\" during his one-hour address. He decried Lacey\u2019s \"incompetence,\" saying \"he's probably a Democrat\" and \"maybe they're a Hillary person.\"", "Our research shows Trump is wrong on several counts. Public records show Lacey is a registered Republican, and fire officials were following standard guidelines for crowd limits.", "Standing room", "Trump\u2019s account of what went wrong at the rally and who was to blame is questionable.", "There were 1,100 people -- not \"thousands\" as he said -- in the overflow room who watched his speech on a TV screen.", "There was a line of people left outside, but it\u2019s unclear if included \"thousands of people,\" as he said.", "What about Trump\u2019s claim that \"We have plenty of space here,\" to let more people into the events center?", "Colorado Springs Fire Department spokesman Steve Wilch told PolitiFact the Trump campaign was aware a day before the rally that Lacey, the fire marshal, had limited the events center to 1,500 spectators and the overflow room to 1,000 spectators.", "UCCS Chancellor Pam Shockley-Zalabak told the Colorado Springs Gazette, \"The campaign handled all the ticketing and more tickets were issued than the space available.\"", "PolitiFact requested comment from the Trump campaign but received no reply.", "In an interview after the rally, Lacey told PolitiFact partner Denver7 that he based his crowd restrictions on a Thursday walk through of the event center and the overflow room, where he double-checked the exits, the size of the space and potential obstructions like crowd-control barriers, the stage and platforms for news cameras.", "Lacey also reviewed the original construction design plans for the building, which had passed international fire and building codes. These plans include a \"life-safety sheet,\" detailing the building\u2019s intended use, square footage, capacity and exits.", "The fire code, which most fire agencies rely on, is \"based on the premise that every space can hold a certain number of people based on the square footage, and then based on the number of people we're going to provide the proper number of exits,\" Boulder Chief Fire Marshal Dave \u00a0Lowrey told PolitiFact.", "What the building is used for is key to determining space requirements known as the \"occupant load factor.\" Restaurants are required to provide 15 square feet per person, because they have tables and chairs that people need to get around while fleeing an emergency, Lowrey said. At a political rally, where people are sitting on folding chairs, the code requires 7 square feet per person. If it\u2019s standing-room-only, the requirement is 5 square feet per person.", "Emergency exits are a key \u2018life-safety factor\u2019", "But the most important \"life-safety factor\" is the number of exits.", "\"If you can't get out of building in an emergency, well, you're in a whole a lot of trouble,\" Lowrey said. \"Every large, tragic indoor fire has probably been contributed to somehow by overcrowding, and blocked exits or locked doors.\"", "Lacey said he worked closely with the Secret Service, police and UCCS officials as he made his decision about the right \"occupant loads\" for the venues.

After conferring with security officials and an on-site fire battalion chief, Lacey said he was comfortable with a 10 percent increase in the events center crowd (to 1,650) and the overflow room (to 1,100).", "Denver7 asked Lacey about Trump\u2019s assertions that he was a disgrace and \"probably a Democrat.\"", "\"Absolutely not,\" the fire marshal replied. \"Anytime that any of the members of the Colorado Springs Fire Department are working, the politics or policies like that are not on our agenda. We're here for public safety and making certain our community is safe from harm.\"", "\"If the event planners wanted to have more people inside, we have a number of venues here in the Colorado Springs area that they could have secured,\" Lacey added. \"But this is the event (venue) that they chose.\"", "While fire marshals wrestle with these life-or-death decisions, they\u2019ve also had Trump publicly berating them in at least four states.", "In Ohio on Monday, Trump pulled aside reporters before a rally at the Greater Columbus Convention Center to rail against another fire marshal\u2019s crowd restrictions.", "\"For political reasons, purely for political reasons, they said in this massive building, you're not allowed to have any more than 1,000 people, and that's nonsense.
