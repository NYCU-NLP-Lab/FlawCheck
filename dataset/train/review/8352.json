["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Along with Doritos and Bud Lite commercials on Super Bowl Sunday, viewers in the Washington area saw a political ad against taxes on food and soft drinks. We wondered if the ad was correct that politicians are seeking to tax sodas and food, so we decided to put the claim to the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nThe ad features a woman talking to the camera as she shops in a grocery store. It has been airing for several weeks in selected markets on cable channels such as CNN.\n\n\"Feeding a family is difficult enough in today's economy,\" the woman says. \"Now, some politicians want the government telling me how I should do it. They want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries I buy, like soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks, even flavored waters, trying to control what we eat and drink with taxes. Give me a break. I can decide what to buy without government help. The government is just getting too involved in our personal lives.\"\n\nAt that point, a narrator says, \"Government needs to trim its budget fat and leave our grocery budgets alone.\"\n\nFirst, some background on the group airing the ad, Americans Against Food Taxes. The group is spearheaded by the American Beverage Association, which represents the makers of sodas and other drinks. According to Advertising Age, \u00a0the American Beverage Association decided to form the coalition in June 2009, when the idea of taxing sodas and other sweet beverages was being considered as a way to fund the Democratic health care bill. The coalition includes dozens of members, including 7-Eleven, Inc., Burger King Corp., Domino\u2019s Pizza, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, McDonalds, the National Association of Convenience Stores, Snack Food Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Wendy\u2019s/Arby\u2019s Group, Inc.\n\nAlthough the food and beverage tax was not included in the health care law, the group has continued to run advertising to forestall any effort to revive such taxes. People watching the ad might think Congress is still considering such a proposal at the federal level. But if you listen closely, the ad played during the Super Bowl is careful to refer to \"politicians\" and \"government\" rather than \"Washington\" or \"Congress.\" (By contrast, other ads the group has run have mentioned Washington.)\n\nThe ad is correct that politicians in some cash-strapped states are considering food and drink taxes.\n\nIn the last two years, many states and cities considered such taxes. According to the Campaign for Healthy Kids, an advocacy group that generally favors such efforts, taxes on soda were enacted in Washington state and proposed -- but not passed -- in Mississippi, New Mexico and the city of Philadelphia.\n\nIn New York, Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a New York City Democrat, has proposed a tax on foods high in calories, fat or carbohydrates, for the past several legislative sessions.\n\nMost state lawmakers were sworn in only a few weeks ago, so we can't predict how many states will consider soda-tax proposals this year. But already, legislators have introduced bills to impose or raise the tax on sodas and/or snack foods in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia, according to separate legislative tracking by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a pro-business advocacy group, and Yale University\u2019s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.\n\nSo while Congress has not been active on this proposal since it was dropped from the health care law, it's been proposed in many states.\n\nThe ad is correct that \"some politicians \u2026 want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries.\" We find the statement True.", "Americans Against Food Taxes, \"Gimme a break\" ad, Jan. 13, 2011\n\nLegislative database, Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, accessed Feb. 7, 2011\n\nAdvertising Age, \"Beverage Lobby Launches Campaign Against Soda Tax,\" Sep. 25, 2009\n\nWashington Times, States eye \u2018sin\u2019 taxation as salvation for budgets, Jan. 16, 2011\n\nHealthDay News, \"The Fat Tax: A Controversial Tool in War Against Obesity,\" Jan. 11, 2011\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures, \"State Budget Update: November 2010,\" Nov. 2011\n\nCampaign for Healthy Kids, \"2010 Session Report,\" accessed Feb. 7, 2011\n\nCongressional Quarterly, \"Soft Drink Taxes Face Hard Battle,\" Feb. 7, 2011 (CQ subscribers only)\n\nInterview with Justin Wilson, senior research analyst with the Center for Consumer Freedom, Feb. 7, 2011\n\nInterview with Arturo Perez, budget policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, Feb. 7, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with David Adkins, executive director of the Council of State Governments, Feb. 7, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Roberta R.
