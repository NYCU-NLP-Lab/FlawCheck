["\u201cPresident Trump tackled the virus head on, as leaders should,\u201d says a narrator in the October 10, 2020 advertisement, which then cuts to a clip of Fauci saying: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that... anybody could be doing more.\u201d", "Fauci, 79, has advised six presidents since becoming head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984, and led US government efforts to counter diseases including HIV/AIDS. But he has become far more widely known during the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 214,00 people in the United States.", "The doctor -- whose direct remarks on failures in America\u2019s response to the virus have drawn him into conflict with Trump -- has been a popular target for disinformation.", "Fauci issued a statement in response to the ad, which uses footage of him from a March 2020 interview on Fox News.", "\u201cIn my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,\u201d Fauci said in the statement.", "\u201cThe comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials,\u201d he said.", "Fauci\u2019s assertion is backed by his full remarks from the interview with Fox\u2019s Mark Levin.", "\u201cI mean, we're talking about all-hands on-deck is that I, I as one of many people on a team, I'm not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was, I have been devoting almost full time on this -- almost full time,\u201d Fauci said.", "\u201cI'm down at the White House virtually every day with the Task Force. I'm connected by phone throughout the day and into the night. When I say night, I'm talking 12, one, two in the morning. I'm not the only one. There's a whole group of us that are doing that. It's every single day,\u201d he said.", "\u201cSo I can't imagine that, that under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously, we're fighting a formidable enemy -- this virus. This virus is a serious issue here.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked a Trump campaign ad that featured doctored images of Joe Biden, as well as the campaign\u2019s false claims that clips showed the Democratic candidate referring to the president\u2019s supporters as the \u201cdregs of society,\u201d and botching the Pledge of Allegiance.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
