["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 24, 2018", "Q: Is George Soros paying Central Americans to immigrate to the U.S.?", "A: That\u2019s an unsubstantiated claim that began with a tweet from Rep. Matt Gaetz and then spread widely online.", "A video purportedly showing Central American emigrants who are part of what has become widely referred to as a \u201ccaravan\u201d was posted last week by Rep. Matt Gaetz and, later, President Donald Trump. It has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.", "The problem is that many claims about those videos also include misinformation.", "The most widely circulated claim came from Gaetz\u2019s original tweet, which said: \u201cBREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time. Soros? US-backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!\u201d", "Gaetz later corrected one piece of information in his original tweet. He\u00a0said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Oct. 21 that the video wasn\u2019t shot in Honduras, but rather in Guatemala. He explained in a tweet\u00a0that \u201cbecause a Honduran government official sent me this video, I believed it came from Honduras.\u201d", "But he has let stand the reference to one of the most common right-wing conspiracy theories \u2014 that liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros is behind it all.", "We\u2019ve debunked a lot of claims that Soros is involved in orchestrating major social or political events. This is just the latest.", "In his tweet, Gaetz suggested, without offering any evidence, that Soros might be funding the immigrants. And that claim has been embraced by the right-wing community\u00a0that is spreading the video online.", "It also has been adopted by websites that traffic in misinformation, which have posted stories with headlines like: \u201cWho\u2019s behind the \u2018migrant caravan\u2019 invasion? \u2013 George Soros and the telltale Star of David,\u201d \u201cSoros\u2019s Human Caravan Slowed In Mexico But Still Pushing North,\u201d and \u201cSoros Letter Reveals Plot to \u2018Take Down Borders\u2019 with Migrant Caravan Invasions.\u201d", "That last story, posted on a website called News Punch, claims, \u201cGeorge Soros and his Open Society Foundations have been plotting since 2015 to use migrant caravan blitzkriegs to achieve the goal of \u2018taking down national borders.'\u201d It cites an email that Soros sent to Bloomberg Business as the only evidence to support the claim, but Soros didn\u2019t say that he had plans of \u201ctaking down national borders.\u201d He did respond to criticism about immigration policy from Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, in a statement to Bloomberg that said, \u201cHis plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\u201d", "Laura Silber, spokeswoman for the Open Society Foundations confirmed to FactCheck.org in an email that neither Soros personally nor his charitable organization have been funding the Central Americans traveling through Mexico.", "Silber said in a statement: \u201cOpen Society certainly supports the historic US commitment to welcoming people fleeing violence and oppression in their home countries \u2014 a commitment honored by presidents of both parties dating back years, prior to 2016. And the foundation has supported various organizations working with immigrants on both sides of the border. But there is no funding going from OSF to the group of people moving north from Honduras into Mexico.\u201d", "Beyond that, the video itself doesn\u2019t even clearly show that it\u2019s money being handed out. The video was shot in the southern Guatemalan city of Chiquimula, which served as a way station for the group of immigrants, who are largely from Honduras. Starting on Oct. 16, a local radio station began reporting on the immigrants\u2019 path through the city, including photos of various things that locals handed out to them, including: Bibles, medical care, and food. At least one church opened its doors to let immigrants sleep inside. It\u2019s likely that the video was taken that day, since Gaetz posted it to Twitter on Oct. 17. It\u2019s unclear if the two men in the video are handing out vouchers, or cash, or informational bulletins, or even who the men are.", "Gaetz said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the video had been provided to him by \u201cHonduran government officials, it was collected by Central American intelligence officials,\u201d but he hasn\u2019t given any further information to support the questions he raised in the tweet about Soros. His office did not respond to our request for more information.", "Gaetz explained on the show that he was raising these questions because Soros has funded non-governmental organizations in the past. He said, \u201cIf you have organizers working in concert with U.S. NGOs or left- leaning groups that\u2019s also a problem. So I think that we\u2019ve seen that model in other parts of the world, Jake, in the Balkans. Judicial watch just did a report where you saw U.S. NGOs working alongside Soros backed groups for political outcomes. I hope that\u2019s not happening in Latin America or anywhere else in the world.\u201d", "While it is certainly true that Open Society works with NGOs to advance democracy abroad and support issues such as anti-discrimination and gender equality, that\u2019s not evidence that Soros or Open Society is funding Central American emigrants to come to the U.S.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cAs human caravan moves through Mexico, \u2018full respect\u2019 needed for national control of borders: UN chief.\u201d Press release.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
