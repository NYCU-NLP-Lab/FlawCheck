["Six months into his presidency, Donald Trump is putting a positive spin on the latest round of public polling on his job performance.", "\"The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning, July 16.", "The ABC News/Washington Post poll actually showed Trump\u2019s approval rating at 36 percent \u2014 not almost 40 percent, as the president stated.", "We decided to fact-check Trump\u2019s claim that his approval rating is \"not bad at this time\" by comparing his numbers to those of other presidents at the six-month mark.", "Since the middle of the 20th century, pollsters have been systematically tracking responses to the question: \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way (president\u2019s name) is handling his job as president?\"", "As a result, a modern-day president\u2019s performance can be tracked against that of historical predecessors as far back as Harry Truman.", "So what to make Trump\u2019s claim that his six-month approval rating is \"not bad\"?", "Before turning to that question, an important caveat is that a widely cited average of Trump approval rating polls by Real Clear Politics does show Trump\u2019s rating hovering around 40 percent.
