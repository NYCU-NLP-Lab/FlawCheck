We\u2019re always battling. We\u2019re one of the fattest states in the country.\"", "Thompson responded by saying:", "\"Yes, we are (battling),\" he said. \"But you know something, but you look at the statistics, and across the board, and Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is.

This type of study can produce lower-than-reality obesity rates, according to CDC, because some people overstate their height and understate their weight.", "Indeed, in the phone surveys, no state had an obesity rate above the 35.7 percent found in the national survey in which people were actually measured.", "The CDC told us that, given the different methodologies, comparing the two studies would be like comparing apples to oranges.", "The latest state data available when Thompson made his statement was for 2012. Based on the responses in the phone survey, 29.7 percent of Wisconsin residents were rated obese. Nationwide, the figure was 28.1 percent.", "So, Wisconsin\u2019s obesity rate was slightly higher than the national rate in the telephone survey study.
