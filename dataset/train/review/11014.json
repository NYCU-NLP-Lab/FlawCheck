The first False Claims Act, also dubbed the \"Lincoln law,\" was enacted during the Civil War to combat fraud by companies selling supplies to the Union Army.", "Today, Georgia and other states have their own False Claims acts, targeting Medicaid fraud. These laws allow states to take civil action against people who swindle money from Medicaid, the state-federal program that covers health care costs for millions of low-income families, the disabled, children and the elderly.", "But has the state recouped more than $60 million in three years as Lindsey claims?
