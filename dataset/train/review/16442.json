What some consider the world\u2019s first photographic portrait could have also been the first selfie. The photograph was taken in 1839 by an amateur chemist named Robert Cornelius: \u201cCornelius had set his camera up at the back of the family store in Philadelphia. He took the image by removing the lens cap and then running into frame where he sat for a minute before covering up the lens again. On the back he wrote 'The first light Picture ever taken. 1839.'\u201d", "Another photograph of a gentlemen taking pictures in 1920 looks like our own modern-day selfie pose. This \"self portrait\" from 1909 also qualifies as a selfie.", "Other sources have claimed that they found the original \u201cselfie stick\u201d:", "We may not be able to confirm precisely when the actual \"first selfie\" was taken, but we do know that it wasn\u2019t taken by Hilton. We thus rate this claim as \u201cMiscaptioned.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
