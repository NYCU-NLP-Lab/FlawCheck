If an Indian leader were indeed invited to an American president\u2019s inauguration, it would have undoubtedly received widespread media coverage. In fact, a number of media outlets have rubbished the claims of Dr Manmohan Singh being invited for the swearing-in ceremony.", "Furthermore, while searching for Joe Biden\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, we found an article in The New York Times from November 9, 2020.

On the JCCIC website, we found a press release dated July 1, 2020, with the latest update. The press release gives details of the preparations for the swearing-in ceremony. It contains no information about the list of attendees or invites. It is worth noting that guests cannot enter without an invitation or ticket. At the time of writing, there was no news of invitations to Biden\u2019s swearing-in ceremony being sent out.", "Alt News reached out to Daman Singh, daughter of former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, to uncover the truth behind this claim. She informed us that Dr Singh had no knowledge of the matter.", "In 2009, no foreign leaders were invited to former US President Barack Obama\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.", "Furthermore, pictures of Dr Singh, Biden, and Clinton accompanying the claim are actually from November 24, 2009, when then-Secretary of State Clinton and then-Vice President Biden organised a lunch program for the former Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh. This is when these photos were also taken. This event has also been mentioned in the archive of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "Therefore, the online claim regarding former Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh\u2019s invitation to the swearing-in ceremony of American President-elect, Joe Biden, is fabricated.
