Mark Pocan called for making it easier to vote in the Badger State.", "But the Madison-area Democrat\u2019s post on Medium, an online publishing platform for sharing information and viewpoints, started by making a claim about voter fraud that we want to check.", "\"First, we need to accept the fact that in-person voter fraud by impersonation is virtually non-existent, with only 10 cases proven nationally out of 1 billion ballots cast since 2000,\" Pocan, who opposes Wisconsin\u2019s newly reinstated photo ID law, wrote in the March 7, 2016 post.", "\"Let\u2019s put it this way, more people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud.\"", "Getting struck by lightning might actually be more common than what you\u2019d guess.", "What about in-person voter fraud by impersonation -- that is, claiming to be someone else as you cast your ballot?", "We\u2019ll note up front that there are various types of voter fraud, but Pocan is citing one particular type.", "Photo ID laws controversial", "Laws requiring citizens to show photo identification in order to vote have long been controversial across the country, including in Wisconsin. They are praised as a way to prevent fraud and criticized as being a barrier for some citizens, including college students and those who don\u2019t have a valid drivers license.", "But when GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in June 2015 that most Americans support voter ID laws, we rated his statement Mostly True. Polls showed strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats.", "Walker signed Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law in 2011, but the requirement was in place for only the spring 2012 primary election before being blocked by court challenges. Those eventually failed and the requirement was reinstated.", "The April 2016 primary was the first high-turnout election since the reinstatement.", "Similar claim", "A claim similar to Pocan\u2019s was made in August 2015, days after Texas\u2019 voter ID law was ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.", "\"You\u2019re more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas\" than find in-person voter fraud, U.S. Sen.

Based on the number of in-person voter fraud cases identified in Texas versus the number of ballots cast, those odds were lower -- 1 in 18 million.", "Pocan\u2019s claim is somewhat different -- it is about actual numbers, not odds, and is national in scope.", "Lightning strikes", "The National Weather Service tracks lightning strikes. The most recent figures -- in terms of injuries as well as deaths caused by lightning strikes -- cover the 10-year period from 2004 through 2013.", "On average, the number of deaths and injuries reported each year was 267 -- 33 deaths, plus 234 injuries.", "The weather service believes that total figure is higher, however, because some injuries from lightning strikes are not reported.
