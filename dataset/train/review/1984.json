["About this rating", "An image macro featuring a picture of 2016 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson alongside a quote purportedly uttered by him about how illegal immigrants should be stripped of U.S. citizenship if they get caught voting fraudulently was frequently circulated on social media in 2016:", "The reproduced quote was a slightly paraphrased version of a sentence Carson wrote in a 2014 opinion piece for WND\u00a0about immigration reform:", "As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: We must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rule of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society. Let\u2019s solve the problem and stop playing political football.", "Although Dr. Carson wrote that \"anyone\" (rather than \"illegal immigrants\") involved in voter fraud should be deported and stripped of citizenship, the context in which the sentence appeared clearly suggested the word \"anyone\" referred specifically to (illegal) immigrants.", "The bolded sentence appeared on WND when the article was originally published on 11 November 2014 but was later removed and does not currently appear in the online version. According to archived versions of the page, the sentence was removed within a few days of publication.", "Although Dr. Carson's gaffe may have been quickly scrubbed by WND, web sites such as\u00a0MSNBC documented the curious statement prior to its removal:", "Of course, Carson\u2019s edict doesn\u2019t make sense: If these are non-citizens, as the context suggests, how can they have their citizenship revoked? If they\u2019re citizens, where are they being deported to?", "While one could argue that the statement was a simple mistake that was quickly corrected, it should be noted that the same sentence\u00a0also appeared in Carson's 2015 book What I Believe: A Collection of My Syndicated Columns.", "The most charitable interpretation of the statement we can discern \u2014 which we do not know Dr. Carson to have offered \u2014 is that he meant to say that any non-citizens caught voting illegally should forfeit all opportunity to become naturalized U.S. citizens in the future.", "Carson, Ben. \u00a0 \"A Common-Sense Prescription for Immigration Reform.\"\r\n \u00a0  \u00a0 WND.  \u00a0 11 November 2014.", "Roth, Zachary. \u00a0 \"Ben Carson: Strip Citizenship from Non-Citizens Who Vote.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 MSNBC. \u00a0 13 November 2014.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
