["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on October 29, 2019", "There\u2019s no evidence for social media claims that the children of Nancy Pelosi, Mitt Romney and John Kerry are working for \u201cUkrainian gas companies\u201d or sitting \u201con the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine.\u201d", "It\u2019s correct that former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, once had a lucrative job sitting on the board for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. That fact \u2014 which has fueled false claims by President Donald Trump \u2014 was alluded to in a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that has helped spur a House impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "But social media posts have applied what we know about Hunter Biden\u2019s position and claimed, without evidence, that the children of other high-profile political figures hold similar roles.", "Some viral posts claim that \u201cBiden\u2019s son, Romney\u2019s son, Pelosi\u2019s son, Kerry\u2019s son are all on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine.\u201d Other posts declare that \u201cBiden, Pelosi, Kerry, & Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies.\u201d (The same posts also repeat\u00a0the false claim that \u201cfrom 1999-2014, Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation than any other foreign country.\u201d)", "We could find no evidence to support the assertion that children of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Secretary of State John Kerry or Sen. Mitt Romney work for any energy companies based in, or doing business in, Ukraine.", "Paul Pelosi Jr.", "Claims about Pelosi\u2019s son, Paul Pelosi Jr., allegedly doing business in Ukraine gained steam earlier this month because of a video from a 2010 XPRIZE Foundation event in Washington, D.C., in which he discusses sitting on the board of a company called Viscoil \u2014 which billed itself as developing energy technologies. (The video also includes footage of Nancy Pelosi speaking at the event.) But Viscoil was based in California \u2014 not in Ukraine \u2014 state records dating back to 2009 show.", "A reporter who writes for websites including the conservative-leaning Epoch Times shared the 2010 video of Paul Pelosi on Twitter, which established Pelosi\u2019s connection to Viscoil; the video was uploaded in 2013 by a Singapore-based company called NRGLab.", "The reporter, Patrick Howley, then pointed to another video also posted on the same day in 2013 by NRGLab \u2014 another promotional video about Viscoil \u2014 whose caption claimed that Ukrainian-born singer \u201cMika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine.\u201d", "\u201cPaul Pelosi Jr. briefly worked for a company named Viscoil Group. The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business. The company dissolved in 2010 and was an LLC registered in California,\u201d Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said in an email statement to FactCheck.org. \u201cThe company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.\u201d", "Hammill confirmed the new entity was NRGLab. Inquiries to the company were not answered; it appears the company is now focused on manufacturing supplements.", "So, in short, we know Pelosi worked for a company whose successor posted a video to YouTube in 2013 \u2014 after Hammill says Pelosi left \u2014 claiming that it was going to produce a product in Ukraine. But it does not appear that \u201cSH-boxes,\u201d which were described by NRGLab as efficient generators, are even in production. And a woman who promoted the SH-Boxes told the fact-checking website Snopes that: \u201cProject SH-Boxed were sold a long time ago to a private company in SEAsia. There was no involvement of Paul Pelosi in that project.\u201d", "Pelosi did visit Ukraine in 2017 \u2014 as another video shows \u2014 in which he said in an interview he was visiting on behalf of an organization he was running called the Corporate Governance Initiative\u00a0(he served as executive director). Hammill told us the visit was \u201ca vacation at personal expense.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the Corporate Governance Initiative \u2014 a company registered in Arizona with a stated purpose of helping organizations develop structures and policies \u2014 is still active. Attempts to contact it were unsuccessful.", "We searched for any news reports or online stories in the decade predating October 2019 \u2014 when conservative websites began publishing stories citing Howley\u2019s aforementioned tweets \u2014 that linked Pelosi to any energy-related business dealings in Ukraine; we instead only found some references to his 2017 visit.", "By contrast, the Associated Press reported on Hunter Biden\u2019s job with Burisma when he was hired in 2014.", "Kerry Family", "Kerry has two grown daughters, Vanessa (a doctor and CEO of a global health nonprofit company) and Alexandra (a film director). He also has three stepsons: Henry John Heinz IV (who reportedly studied to become a blacksmith and founded a school in Pennsylvania), Andr\u00e9\u00a0Heinz (who co-founded a private equity management firm focused on \u201ccleantech\u201d) and Christopher Heinz (a former senior vice president at PNC Bank).", "We found no evidence that any of them sat on a board for any \u201cenergy companies doing business in Ukraine.\u201d", "This claim may be a distortion of Christopher Heinz\u2019s connection to Hunter Biden (who, as we said, did sit on the board of Burisma).", "Heinz reportedly had started an investment firm with Hunter Biden and a fellow Yale graduate, Devon Archer. But Heinz \u201cended his business relationship\u201d with the two because he believed \u201cjoining the board of Burisma Holdings was a bad idea,\u201d according to the Washington Post, which cited a spokesman for Heinz.", "That spokesman confirmed the same to FactCheck.org and called the viral social posts \u201ctotally inaccurate.\u201d", "\u201cMr. Heinz has never been on the board of any energy company; nor has he ever traveled to or worked in Ukraine,\u201d Chris Bastardi said in an email. \u201cChris was never involved with Burisma in any way.\u201d", "Romney Sons", "Romney, meanwhile, has five sons. Tagg Romney is co-founder of the investment firm Solamere Capital. Matt Romney is a partner and managing director for capital markets at a firm called Sundance Bay \u2014 which also lists Craig Romney, the youngest son, as director of asset management. Josh Romney is chairman and owner of mortgage lender Intercap Lending. Ben Romney is a radiologist in Utah, according to his LinkedIn profile.", "We could find no evidence to support the idea that any of the Romney sons sit on the board of energy companies doing business in Ukraine. A spokeswoman for the senator declined to comment on what she deemed \u201cfake news from random online trolls.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
