According to the BBC.", "Those taking to the streets say that the stringent measures restricting movement and businesses are unnecessarily hurting citizens.", "Protesters say the stay-at-home measures imposed by state governments to control the spread of Covid-19 are an overreaction.", "Some have also come bearing firearms as gun rights groups have been among the organisers, citing infringements on civil liberties.", "Some also say keeping these restrictions in place too long will cause long-term damage to local economies.", "For the most part the anti-lockdown protests were peaceful, although a few unseemly incidents of a non-violent nature did take place. For example, social media posts claimed that a few people in Columbus, Ohio, had taken advantage of the demonstration to display an anti-Semitic message:", "Unfortunately, this image was all too real, as Cleveland.com reported:", "A photo from the stay-at-home protest at the Statehouse is gaining traction on Twitter for its anti-Semitic message.", "The photograph captured two men in a minivan.

I\u2019m not going to let that pass. I\u2019m not. There are people out there exercising their rights. By no means am I saying they\u2019re all anti-Semitic, they\u2019re all racists, but there is an element there. I\u2019m glad to support everyone\u2019s First Amendment right to express their view, and I will gladly exercise mine to push back on anti-Semitism whenever and wherever I see it.\"", "Hancock, Laura. \u00a0 \"Some Ohio Coronavirus Protesters Using Anti-Semitic Symbolism.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Cleveland.com. \u00a0 19 April 2020.", "BBC News. \u00a0 \"Coronavirus Lockdown Protest: What's Behind the US Demonstrations?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 21 April 2020.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
