At the same point in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Obama\u2019s approval rating per Rasmussen was 48 percent and 49 percent. But Trump inaccurately described his poll number as \u201cmuch higher than President Obama at the same point.\u201d", "The margin of error for the latest\u00a0Rasmussen daily tracking poll is plus or minus 2.5 percent,\u00a0which means Trump\u2019s approval rating could fall somewhere between 47.5 percent and 52.5 percent.", "Trump tweeted on April 15 that he had \u201cjust hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll.\u201d", "Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it\u2019s hard to believe! Thank you America, we are doing Great Things.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018", "Trump actually has hit 50 percent, and higher, several times in the Rasmussen poll.

All three polls were taken this month.", "If we look at Real Clear Politics\u2019 average of polling data, Trump\u2019s latest approval rating is 42.1 percent, a bit below the average of 44.3 percent on Jan. 27, 2017, a week after he took the oath of office.", "Obama, meanwhile, had an average approval of 63.3 percent on Jan. 27, 2009, and an average of 47.7 percent on April 17, 2010, according to RCP.", "FiveThirtyEight provides a weighted average of presidential approval polls\u00a0and compares Trump\u2019s figures with those of past presidents, going back to Harry S.
