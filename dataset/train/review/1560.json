A group of international players (including members of the U.S. squad) took legal action to prevent this, because playing on artificial turf is widely considered to increase the risk of injury. The lawsuit was later dropped.", "The actor also referred to Bosom Buddies, a 1980s sitcom in which he and Peter Scolari played young men pretending to be women in order to stay in a cheap Manhattan apartment.", "Since then, the image has been doctored to show Hanks championing environmentalist causes, including the April 2017 March for Science:", "Please Support @ScienceMarchDC in ur state!
