(AP/Brandon)", "On a day that ended with President Donald Trump becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached, House Democrats hammered Trump for refusing to comply with their investigation, saying his stonewalling proved he has something to hide.", "\"(This) was an attempt by Donald J. Trump to aim Ukrainian corruption straight at the heart of the presidential election of 2020,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"The president knows this, which is why he has not given this Congress a single email, phone record or document.\"", "The truth is clear to anyone not deliberately looking away.Instead of fighting corruption the President aimed it at the 2020 presidential election.Today, I answer the call to defend our democracy and the United States Constitution.
