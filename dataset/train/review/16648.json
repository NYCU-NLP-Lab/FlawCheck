Inside, more than 20,000 attendees raised Nazi salutes toward a 30-foot-tall portrait of George Washington flanked by swastikas. Outside, police and some 100,000 protestors gathered.", "The organization behind the February 20, 1939 event\u2014advertised on the arena's marquee as a \"Pro American Rally\"\u2014was the German American Bund (\"Bund\" is German for \"federation\"). The anti-semitic organization held Nazi summer camps for youth and their families during the 1930s. The Bund's youth members were present that night, as were the Ordnungsdienst, or OD, the group's vigilante police force who dressed in the style of Hitler's SS officers.", "Banners at the rally had messages like \"Stop Jewish Domination of Christian Americans\" and \"Wake Up America. Smash Jewish Communism.\" When the Bund's national leader, Fritz Kuhn, gave his closing speech, he referred to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as \"Rosenfield,\" and Manhattan District Attorney Thomas Dewey as \"Thomas Jewey.\"", "Contemporary news articles noted that around 20,000 people attended this rally, while close to 100,000 \"anti-Nazis,\" made up of protesters, theatergoers, and passersby, gathered outside the arena. The day after the rally, The Associated Press reported that about a dozen protesters were arrested following scuffles with police. Newspaper columnist Dorothy Thompson was nearly ejected from the rally after she shouted \"nonsense\" during a pro-Nazi speech.", "Tue, Feb 21, 1939 \u2013 Page 1 \u00b7 The Plain Speaker (Hazleton, Pennsylvania) \u00b7 Newspapers.com", "The 1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden was also featured in a 2017 Oscar-nominated documentary short called \"A Night At the Garden.\"", "https://vimeo.com/234762935", "While the images displayed at the top of this page are often shared as if they come from a single Nazi rally in 1939, however, there were actually several Nazi rallies held at the famous arena throughout the 1930s. The photograph showing the Nazi flag surrounded by American flags, for example, was taken at a rally in 1938. We also found a\u00a0photograph that showed a group of children raising Nazi salutes on stage at the Garden in 1936. The following image shows another 20,000-person rally that was organized by the League of the Friends of the New Germany, the American pro-Nazi organization that preceded the German American Bund, at Madison Square Garden in 1934:", "Getty Images", "It should be noted that these Nazi rallies did not take place at the Madison Square Garden currently standing in 2020, but at the old building referred to as MSG III, which was built in 1925 and demolished in the 1960s.", "History.com. \u00a0 \"Americans Hold a Nazi Rally in Madison Square Garden.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 20 February 2019.", "Wilkinson, Alissa. \u00a0 \"80 years ago, 20,000 New Yorkers Cheered for Nazis at Madison Square Garden.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 20 Febraury 2019.", "The Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Wild Scenes in Madison Square Garden As Nazis Hold Rally.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 21 February 1939.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
