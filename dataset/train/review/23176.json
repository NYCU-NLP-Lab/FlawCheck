["By Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on August 15, 2016", "In a speech in Ohio on terrorism, Donald Trump repeated several fact-twisting and bogus claims he has made before:", "Trump misrepresented a TV interview he gave in January 2003 to claim that he opposed the Iraq War \u201cfrom the beginning.\u201d In that interview, Trump said polling showed\u00a0the economy is a \u201cmuch bigger problem\u201d for President Bush than Iraq, but he expressed no opinion on whether the U.S. should invade.", "As we have written before, Trump on numerous occasions has made the claim without providing evidence that he was opposed to the Iraq War before it started.\u00a0In this speech, he claims to have the evidence \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t have the goods. Instead, he cherry-picks his quotes to twist the facts.", "Trump, Aug. 15: I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning \u2013 a major\u00a0difference between me and my opponent.\u00a0Though I was a private citizen, whose personal opinions on such\u00a0matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private\u00a0doubts about the invasion. I was against it, believe me. Three months before the invasion I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, to whom I offer my best wishes for a\u00a0speedy recovery, that quote, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and that\u00a0the economy is a much bigger problem.", "Trump did not tell Cavuto that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and that\u00a0the economy is a much bigger problem.\u201d Trump is conflating two separate statements and presenting them as a single sentence and thought.", "A little background: The Jan. 28, 2003, interview with Cavuto on Fox Business\u00a0was conducted prior to President Bush\u2019s State of the Union address that would be delivered that night. Cavuto starts by asking Trump what advice he would give the president on how much time to devote to Iraq and how much to the economy. Trump said the American public is \u201cmuch more focused now on the economy,\u201d and he criticized the Bush administration for dragging out the decision on whether to invade Iraq.", "\u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack,\u201d Trump said.", "Trump softened his criticism when Cavuto asked Trump if what he was saying was that Bush\u2019s indecision \u201ccould ultimately hurt us.\u201d", "\u201cWell, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps [we] shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,\u201d Trump responds. \u201cHe\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job.\u201d", "Trump switched to defending the administration and presented the alternative argument that the invasion should have the support of the United Nations. He\u00a0didn\u2019t say the U.S. shouldn\u2019t invade Iraq.", "Trump then went\u00a0on to say, \u201cBut, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\u201d", "Once again, Trump didn\u2019t say the U.S. shouldn\u2019t invade Iraq. He said public opinion polls show the economy is a \u201cmuch bigger problem\u201d for Bush.", "Below is a fuller exchange with Cavuto. We marked in bold the passages that Trump highlighted in his speech. They are not part of the same sentence, or even the same thought.", "Cavuto, Jan. 28, 2003: If you had to sort of breakdown for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit [in the State of the Union] to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?", "Trump: Well, I\u2019m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we\u2019re going in, we\u2019re not going in, the \u2014 you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. We have to \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort like either do it or don\u2019t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we\u2019re going to attack, what routes we\u2019re taking, what kind of planes we\u2019re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I\u2019ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how \u2014 telling the enemy how we\u2019re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.", "Cavuto: Well, the problem right there.", "Trump: Either you attack or you don\u2019t attack.", "Cavuto: The problem there, Donald, is you\u2019re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.", "Trump: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is \u2014 just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don\u2019t do it, or you \u2014 but I just \u2014 or if you don\u2019t do it, just don\u2019t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.", "Cavuto: So you\u2019re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.", "Trump: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps [we] shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.", "Trump also offered as evidence an interview with Esquire that ran in the August 2004 edition \u2014 17 months after the Iraq War\u00a0started. As we have written, Trump was an early critic of the war after it started, but we can find no clear evidence that he was opposed to it before it started.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6be1a6ee-1063-4048-9734-16d0bacfcc33", "Trump blamed President Obama for setting a date for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, but that date had been set by an agreement signed by President George W. Bush.", "Trump: But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.\u00a0After we had made those hard-fought sacrifices and gains, we should never have made such a sudden withdrawal \u2013 on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said we\u2019re moving out, here\u2019s our time, here\u2019s our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president?", "As we recently explained, some have argued that Obama could have done more to\u00a0renegotiate the Status of Forces Agreement signed by Bush in 2008. But Trump blames the wrong president for, in his words, saying, \u201chere\u2019s our time, here\u2019s our date.\u201d", "Bush signed the SOFA\u00a0on Dec. 14, 2008. It\u00a0said: \u201cAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u201d Then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in a book published in 2011 that Bush didn\u2019t want to set a deadline and wanted an agreement for a residual force \u2014 but Iraqi\u00a0Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected. Bush reluctantly signed the agreement.", "Obama had three years to renegotiate, and, indeed, Obama\u00a0sought to leave a residual force of 5,000 to 10,000 troops. But Maliki wouldn\u2019t agree to shield U.S. troops from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities, and the negotiations ended in October 2011 over that issue.", "Then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta later wrote in his 2014 book that Obama didn\u2019t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Maliki wasn\u2019t going to agree to a residual force. Iraq was more closely aligned with Iran at that point.", "Maliki \u201cwanted the Americans out of there \u2014 and the Iranians wanted the same thing,\u201d Princeton University professor\u00a0Bernard Haykel, who heads the university\u2019s Institute for Transregional Study of the Contemporary Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, told us. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a deal to be had \u2014 not one in which the Americans would have had immunity.\u201d", "As for Clinton \u2014 who was secretary of state at the time \u2014 she publicly supported Obama. In 2014, she blamed the Iraqi government for not coming to\u00a0an agreement to protect American troops.

They get out. That\u2019s how they get out.\u00a0Declare victory and leave, because I\u2019ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e5fb48df-724c-4f7a-8aa8-3cba9b5b6e4e", "Trump cited two bogus examples to back up his point that \u201cwarning signs were totally ignored\u201d in recent terrorist shootings.", "Stop us if you\u2019ve heard these before, because we have written about these claims several times. But it bears repeating: Neither of these claims has been substantiated.", "Here\u2019s what Trump said in his Aug. 15 speech on \u201cUnderstanding The Threat: Radical Islam And The Age Of Terror.\u201d", "Trump: Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. \u2026", "The female San Bernardino shooter on her \u2026 statements and everything that she said. She was here on a fiancee visa, which most people have never even heard of. From Saudi Arabia.

Now, many are dead, and many more are gravely wounded.", "We wrote about the first claim back in March when then Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz claimed that the woman involved in the San Bernardino, California, shooting had \u201cpublicly posted on social media calls to jihad.\u201d", "The Dec. 2, 2015,\u00a0shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 dead was carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was born in the United States, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who came to the U.S. from Pakistan in July 2014\u00a0on a K-1 fiancee visa. Farook and Malik were killed in a police shootout.", "Support\u00a0material for Trump\u2019s speech provided by his campaign links to two articles, one by CNN\u00a0and the other in the Los Angeles Times, both on Dec. 14. Both stories cited unnamed law enforcement officials saying that the woman sent messages advocating jihad on social media, but both noted the messages were private and written under a pseudonym.", "The New York Times \u2014 which wrote on Dec. 12 that Malik had \u201ctalked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad\u201d \u2014 later added an editor\u2019s note explaining that that wasn\u2019t correct, and that FBI Director James B.

Sullivan quoted Executive Editor Dean Baquet as saying, \u201cThis was a really big mistake.\u201d", "Sullivan wrote that Comey\u2019s statements, in addition to further reporting by the Times, found \u201cMs. Malik had not posted \u2018openly\u2019 on social media. She had written emails; she had written private messages, not visible to the public; and she had written on a dating site. \u2026 In other words, the story\u2019s clear implication that those who vetted Ms. Malik\u2019s visa had missed the boat \u2013 a clearly visible ocean liner \u2013 was based on a false premise.\u201d", "Trump was also off-base with his claim that \u201ca neighbor saw suspicious behavior \u2014 bombs on the floor and other things \u2013 but didn\u2019t warn authorities because they said they didn\u2019t want to be accused of racial profiling.\u201d", "Despite Trump\u2019s repeated claims, there is no evidence that any neighbor saw \u201cbombs on\u00a0the floor\u201d of the San Bernardino shooters\u2019 home but declined to report it because of\u00a0racial profiling concerns.", "Authorities did find what the Los Angeles Times described as \u201can armory of weapons and explosives \u2026 including a dozen pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition\u201d in the Redlands home of the couple responsible for the shooting rampage.

But Clinton didn\u2019t say that\u2019s how many refugees she would allow into the country. The Republican-led subcommittee made assumptions about what Clinton would do as president.", "Trump: The United States Senate subcommittee on immigration estimates that Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term, assuming no cuts to other refugee programs. So it could get worse.", "Last year, Clinton proposed that the U.S. accept 65,000 refugees from Syria. That was 55,000 more than the 10,000 President Obama authorized for admission from that country for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. In all, Obama authorized the admission of 85,000 refugees from all nations in fiscal 2016, and Secretary of State John Kerry has said that the administration\u00a0would aim to admit at least 100,000 global refugees in fiscal 2017.", "To get to 620,000 refugees, the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest assumed that Clinton would do something she has not explicitly said that she would \u2014 allow 155,000 refugees into the U.S. each year during her first term as president.", "Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest, June 27, 2016:\u00a0Assuming Clinton\u2019s desire to bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees is in addition to the Obama Administration\u2019s current goal of admitting 10,000 this fiscal year (out of 85,000 total refugees), that would amount to an increase of 55,000 refugees. \u200e55,000 on top of 85,000 totals 140,000 refugees. The Obama Administration\u2019s target for FY 2017 is actually 100,000 refugees, meaning that adding 55,000 refugees to that would result in 155,000 refugees each year. Due to statutory flaws in our Refugee Admissions Program, the number could be as high as Hillary Clinton desires. Assuming her goal is to admit 155,000 refugees each year during a hypothetical first term in office, a Clinton Administration would admit at least 620,000 refugees in just four years \u2013 a population roughly the size of Baltimore.", "So, it\u2019s not \u201cClinton\u2019s plan\u201d to admit 620,000 refugees as president. The subcommittee assumed she wanted to do that,\u00a0even though Clinton has not specified a figure for all refugees over four years.", "Trump went on to say that the Republican subcommittee \u201cestimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the costs of health care, welfare, housing, schooling, and all other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department\u2019s placement figures.\u201d So, that \u201clifetime\u201d estimate is also based on an assumption about the number of admitted refugees that Clinton has not yet addressed.
