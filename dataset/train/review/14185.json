In fact, the company banned the sale of assault-style rifles in its stores in 2015.", "Ruhle\u2019s use of the term \"assault-style weapons\" could lead to some confusion, since there\u2019s no universal definition for it.", "Generally, people on both sides of the gun debate agree that fully automatic weapons, which are heavily regulated, should be considered assault weapons. (Fully automatic weapons are subject to strict regulations that make them difficult for civilian buyers to purchase.)

Those steps included ending the sale of assault rifles in 2015, a decision the company attributed to low consumer demand, not calls for gun control, according to the New York Times.", "\"We stopped selling assault-style weapons in 2015,\" Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told PolitiFact. \"We have a longstanding commitment to selling firearms safely and compliantly.\"", "It is accurate that Walmart is one of the largest sellers of firearms and ammunition in the United States, Hargrove said.

It also raised the age limit on gun purchases to 21.", "The company has also said it only sells handguns in its Alaska stores, and in July, it stopped selling all guns in New Mexico after the state broadened its law on background checks.", "Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods decided to stop selling assault-style rifles in 2018, as well.", "According to CNN, Bass Pro Shops still sells semi-automatic rifles, and its subsidiary Cabela\u2019s offers what its website refers to as \"semi-automatic tactical rifles.\" Gander Outdoors also lists \"semi-auto action\" firearms on its website.
