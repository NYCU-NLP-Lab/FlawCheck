["A dozen days before suspending his presidential candidacy, Sen. Ted Cruz charged Donald Trump with being the second-most disliked candidate for president, implying that only Hillary Clinton was worse off.", "The Texan's claim emerged in an online ad, \"War Room,\" which was posted as Cruz scrambled unsuccessfully to best Trump in Kentucky\u2019s April 2016 Republican presidential primary.", "The shadowy video purports to show the actress portraying Clinton huddling with nervous advisers who say first that Trump has considerable weaknesses. \"He has the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone running for president,\" an adviser says. Next, another pretend aide asks who has the highest (or worst) disapproval rating--and all eyes fall away.", "Of late, Trump and Clinton appear to be poised for a November showdown in the general election, representing the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively. It\u2019s also so that fresh polls including an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken in mid-May 2016 suggest each hopeful has high unfavorability ratings--giving the two unwelcome common ground.", "Regardless, we checked Cruz\u2019s poll claim in part because whenever candidates tout polls, there\u2019s a risk of obfuscation and oversimplification. For instance, this April we rated False Trump\u2019s claim that his favorability numbers were higher than Ronald Reagan\u2019s at the same time in 1980. Also in April, we rated Mostly False Cruz\u2019s claim that \"poll after poll\" showed him beating Clinton one-on-one.", "So for recent history\u2019s sake, we decided to see if Cruz was right pre-departure about Trump having the second-highest disapproval ratings among all presidential hopefuls.", "Cruz\u2019s data", "In response to our query, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed data from a national poll released Feb. 18, 2016, by respected pollster Quinnipiac University, naming Clinton and Trump the least-favored candidates, respectively.", "The questionnaire asked 1,342 registered voters intended to represent the national electorate between February 10 and 15, 2016, whether their opinions of 11 candidates and politicians were favorable, unfavorable,or if they lacked the information to judge. Fifty-eight percent registered as \"unfavorable\" to Clinton, 57 percent said as much for Trump.", "Then again, the poll\u2019s 2.7 percentage point margin of error means that Clinton\u2019s lead on Trump for unfavorability was too close to call.", "We looked into other voter polls, finding -- in contrast to Cruz\u2019s claim -- Trump uniformly viewed as the least liked candidate, counting Clinton and others still vying at the time of the respective polls.", "But first we heard back from Tim Malloy, assistant director of Quinnipiac Polls, who said in a phone interview that it\u2019s \"apples and oranges\" to mix up polls that gauge voter impressions of candidates with those that check on whether they approve or disapprove of someone\u2019s job performance.", "Favorability, Malloy said, rates people\u2019s overall impression of candidates, including their character and personality. \u00a0\"It\u2019s pretty much, \u2018Do you like the person?\u2019\" he said.", "Approval ratings tie to how well people think someone has done a job. For example, Malloy said, at the end of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s years in that office, Giuliani had low favorability and high approval. People didn\u2019t much like him, Malloy said, yet they thought he did a good job as mayor.", "Other data", "Now let\u2019s turn to what other polls showed per the frontrunners\u2019 favorable/unfavorable ratings at the time Cruz was still a candidate.", "Up to the debut of Cruz\u2019s ad, the political poll aggregator RealClearPolitics had posted 59 polls rating Trump\u2019s favorability, starting from a Quinnipiac poll taken in May 2015, weeks before he announced his candidacy. It had posted more than 200 polls rating Clinton\u2019s favorability, starting from a Rasmussen poll taken in November 2012.", "As of May 25, 2016, the website\u2019s aggregation of polls gave Clinton a net 56.3 percent unfavorable rating; Trump had a net 58 percent unfavorable rating.", "But that didn\u2019t nail down the two candidates\u2019 scores at the time Cruz aired his ad.", "For our part, we pulled the relevant results from 21 polls rating candidate favorability and listed by RealClearPolitics between the Feb. 18, 2016 publication of the Quinnipiac poll shared by the Cruz campaign and the April 21, 2016, debut of Cruz\u2019s ad, also folding in the poll immediately before the Feb. 18 poll.", "Some of the 22 polls contacted registered voters while others surveyed likely voters.
