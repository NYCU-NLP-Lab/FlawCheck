["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The latest ousted U.S. official to feel the wrath of the president\u2019s loyalists is Marie Yovanovitch.", "In April, she was abruptly removed from her job as ambassador to Ukraine in response to pressure from the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. (Giuliani and other former Ukrainian officials stood to lose from her anti-corruption initiatives.)", "Now, Yovanovitch is a key witness in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. The president\u2019s supporters have tried to discredit Yovanovitch \u2014 and the entire probe, for that matter.", "U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican from western North Carolina who chaired the conservative Freedom Caucus, recently brushed off Yovanovitch\u2019s removal as routine. In a tweet following Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 15, Meadows wrote:", "\"For Washington Democrats and pundits who are incredulous that @realDonaldTrump recalled an ambassador, certain that it must be evidence of a conspiracy\u2026", "President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election.\"", "We wondered whether it was true that Obama fired all of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors.", "There are two breeds of ambassadors: political appointees and career diplomats.", "Political appointees are usually stationed in countries that are U.S. allies or desirable locations, like the Bahamas. These plum jobs are often awarded to the president\u2019s friends and donors.", "They step aside when a new president is elected. Peter Feaver, a political scientist at Duke University, said, \"It is customary for political ambassadors to rotate out within the first several months of a change in administration precisely because one of their top assets \u2014 their closeness to the occupant of the Oval Office \u2014 disappears with the departing president.\"", "Those are the people who cycled out when Obama took office. That\u2019s standard practice.", "In his tweet, Meadows linked to a Washington Post article from Dec. 2008 to back up his claim. The article said that the Obama administration told all of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors to vacate their posts by Jan. 20.", "But we found at least a couple of examples of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors staying in their posts past Inauguration Day, which also is standard practice.", "One example: Bush appointee Victor Ashe told PolitiFact that the Obama team asked him to continue serving as ambassador to Poland until his successor was confirmed. He ended up staying for nine months into Obama\u2019s first term.", "\"I was flattered,\" Ashe said. \"I thought it was a tribute to my service, that I acted in a nonpartisan way.\"", "A Snopes article from 2017 concluded, \"We found similar examples of presidents allowing ambassadors appointed by their predecessors to remain at their posts past Inauguration Day for every presidential transition dating back to 1977, when Jimmy Carter succeeded Gerald Ford.\"", "So, it\u2019s not accurate to say that Obama \"fired every Bush appointed ambassador.\" Indeed, he wasn\u2019t even the one to ask for their resignations.", "Ashe told us that the ambassadors received notice from the Bush White House requesting a letter of resignation effective Jan. 20, 2009. In routine fashion, they obliged.", "Many of Bush\u2019s political appointees left their posts by Inauguration Day, but Ashe and some others were asked to withdraw their resignations and stay on during the transition, Ashe said.", "It\u2019s important to note that Yovanovitch\u2019s case is different. She is a career diplomat, not a political appointee, who has served under three presidents. Also, she was ousted more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, not during a transition period.", "Career diplomats hold the majority of ambassadorships. They are foreign service officers who rose through the ranks, often serving for decades before becoming ambassadors. While it\u2019s customary for political appointees to cycle out when a new president takes office, career diplomats usually stay in their posts.", "In his tweet, Meadows tried to characterize Yovanovitch\u2019s removal as routine \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 criticisms about Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster as invalid.", "But he\u2019s applying the practice of replacing political appointees \u2014 and wrongly characterizing what Obama did, to a large extent \u2014 to career diplomats.", "Meadows claimed that Obama \"fired\" all of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors.", "There\u2019s an element of truth to that \u2014 they rotated out of their positions as political appointees do with every administration \u2014\u00a0 but Obama did not \"fire\" them. Indeed, Ashe told us it was actually the Bush White House that asked for his resignation. That was routine, unlike Yovanovitch\u2019s removal.", "And at least a couple of political appointees, including Ashe, actually stayed months into Obama\u2019s presidency.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "Correction: In the first reference to Ashe, we've corrected the sentence to say \"successor\" rather \"predecessor.\"", "Mark Meadows tweet, Nov. 15, 2019", "Email interview, Ben Williamson, communications director for Rep.
