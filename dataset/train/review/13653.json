["About this rating", "In early June 2018, we received numerous e-mails from readers about a Facebook post showing immigrant children in orange jumpsuits:", "When and where was the picture of child prisoners in orange jumpsuits taken? Is it really of immigrant children separated from their families?", "Sending you a photo, going around Facebook with immigrant children, supposedly removed from parents at US borders, posing at a detention facility, wearing orange prison jumpsuits. MOST posts are challenging as \"Fake News\", a lawyer friend says this is probably staged since PHOTOGRAPHS are not permitted in Homeland Security facilities nor the private prison contractors FOUR that we know of in TX.

She had been apprehended two days earlier after rafting across the Rio Grande near a county park with big trees and picnic tables that abuts the international line. She wept as she told Morgan, \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, but the circumstances in my country made me do it.\u201d She said she\u2019d been almost raped and killed there, and she had come to the U.S. for protection and to see if she could help her sisters escape the danger.", "\u201cYou are going to be sent to one of the immigration camps,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou can try and request asylum.\u201d", "By May 10, Morgan was starting to get rattled by the increasingly disturbing content of the allocutions.
