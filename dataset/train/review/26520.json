While a few versions of this viral message exist, the following text appears to be one of the most popular iterations:", "Please be advised, within 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke what is called the Stafford act. Just got off the phone with some of my military friends down in DC who had a two hour briefing. The president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation.
