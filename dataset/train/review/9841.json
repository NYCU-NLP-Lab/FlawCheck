["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 8, 2021", "The campaign committee for House Democrats is running ads that claim eight House Republicans \u201cstood with Q, not you,\u201d because they voted against impeaching then-President Donald Trump for inciting the violent insurrection at the Capitol.", "But none of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. Some QAnon followers also participated in the deadly Jan. 6 riot because they believed the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.", "While all eight members named by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee voted against impeaching Trump for a second time, three of them \u2014 Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Young Kim of California \u2014 supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on Congress.", "The DCCC says it is spending over $500,000 on the ad campaign that \u201cexposes seven vulnerable Washington Republicans and [House] Minority Leader [Kevin] McCarthy for being too weak to stand up to President Trump and the QAnon mob after Trump whipped them into a murderous frenzy, making it clear that each \u2018stood with Q, not you.'\u201d", "The ads, which are some of the first ones the committee has released for the 2022 election cycle, are playing online and airing on broadcast and cable stations in Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, Omaha and Washington, D.C.", "All seven of the ads start with a narrator saying: \u201cQAnon, a conspiracy theory born online, took over the Republican Party, sent followers to Congress, and, with Donald Trump, incited a mob that took over the Capitol and murdered a cop.\u201d", "From there, the ads accuse Fitzpatrick, Bacon, Kim, McCarthy, as well as Reps. Beth Van Duyne of Texas, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, and Michelle Steel and Mike Garcia of California of being cowards who voted to protect Trump.", "At the end of each ad, the narrator says the GOP representatives in question \u201cstood with Q, not you.\u201d Here\u2019s an example:", "But it\u2019s misleading to suggest they all support QAnon because \u2014 according to the citations in the ads \u2014 they opposed Trump\u2019s second impeachment.", "We know of only two members of Congress who have previously promoted or expressed support for the QAnon movement: Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado. Boebert, however, later said that she is \u201cnot a follower of QAnon.\u201d (Both Greene and Boebert are shown on screen in the DCCC ads.)", "In fact, in September, Fitzpatrick was among a bipartisan group of five House members who co-sponsored Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski\u2019s nonbinding resolution \u201ccondemning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories it promotes,\u201d according to a congressional summary. Bacon, Garcia and McCarthy also were among the 371 House members who voted in favor of that resolution the following month. (The other four Republicans the DCCC is going after were not in Congress at the time of the vote.)", "In addition, Fitzpatrick, Bacon and Kim supported a resolution to censure Trump rather than impeach him.", "In a statement, Fitzpatrick, who introduced the resolution, which attracted a total of nine Republican co-sponsors, said: \u201cI support a bipartisan censure resolution making sure that the Congress holds the President accountable by putting it on the record that Congress condemns his reprehensible conduct which led to the riots at our nation\u2019s Capitol \u2014 a permanent stain on his legacy. Our country deserves closure, and the opportunity to begin anew with the incoming administration. And a censure resolution is the only unifying means for achieving this.\u201d", "Bacon said he supported a censure because Trump \u201cwas wrong to not concede and bears much responsibility for what happened on January 6.\u201d Kim said censuring Trump was \u201ca better option\u201d than impeachment and \u201cwould be a strong rebuke of his actions and rhetoric and unite our country and chamber, rather than divide it.\u201d", "As for the other GOP members mentioned in the attack ads:", "DCCC spokesman Cole Leiter defended the ads in a phone call.", "He told us there is no question that Republicans who opposed impeachment voted to protect Trump rather than hold him accountable, which he said puts them on the side of many QAnon members who also were against impeaching Trump.", "But, as we said, three of those who voted not to impeach Trump \u2014 Fitzpatrick, Bacon and Kim \u2014 criticized Trump over the attack on the Capitol and supported reprimanding him with a censure, which is a form of disapproval.", "That wouldn\u2019t carry the same legal weight as an impeachment conviction, but it\u2019s direct criticism of Trump, not an endorsement.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
