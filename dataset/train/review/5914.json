["About this rating", "A Michigan lawmaker is under fire for suggesting that the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol \u2014 which resulted in the deaths of five people \u2014 was a \u201choax\u201d staged to reflect poorly on then-U.S. President Donald Trump.", "Michigan state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey was filmed during lunch on Feb. 3 with representatives from the Hillsdale County Republican Party, which he represents, pushing baseless claims that groups other than pro-Trump supporters were responsible for the violent siege at the nation\u2019s capital. (We've debunked a number of related allegations here.)", "The video, which was about an hour long, went viral after being first reported by the Detroit Metro Times on Feb. 9. The video of the lawmaker appeared to be captured on a handheld device and was shared to YouTube the same day by Reclaim Our American Republic (ROAR), a self-published news page headed by Hillsdale County Republican Party Secretary Jon Smith. Smith told Snopes that he did not tell Shirkey that he was recording, but that the lawmaker later said that he knew that he was being filmed.", "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s people. That\u2019s been a hoax from day one. That was all prearranged,\u201d said Shirkey, who represents the 16th District. \u201cIt was arranged by somebody who was funding it\u2026 it was all staged.\u201d", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2j92O7TFRo+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrotimes.com%2Fnews-hits%2Farchives%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2Fmichigan-state-sen-shirkey-censured-by-hillsdale-county-gop-says-he-doesnt-give-a-shit%3Futm_source%3Dfeaturefollow&utm_medium=home&utm_campaign=hpfeatures&utm_content=HomeTopFeature", "In a phone interview, Smith told Snopes that Shirkey had requested to speak with him and party Chair Daren Wiseley to defend his political censure planned for Feb. 4. The Hillsdale Republican Party voted to censure Shirkey for his expressed views, including the \u201ccondemnation of peaceful protestors at the Capital, publicly calling them a \u2018bunch of jackasses.\u2019\u201d", "In response to his own party censuring him, Shirkey said that he didn\u2019t \u201cgive a shit,\u201d according to the Detroit Metro Times.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s a very sad and somber video. I think it\u2019s a sad disconnect between the average person and government,\u201d Smith told Snopes describing the Shirkey video. \u201cThe [Republican] party is in a lot of ways, splintered, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different from the Democrat party. They are splintered as well. We\u2019re just seeing things polarized so much and I don\u2019t know what the fix is per se, but what we do know is that we have to get people out of office that misrepresent our party.\u201d", "Following backlash from widespread media coverage, Shirkey issued an apology that same day.", "\u201cI said some things in a videoed conversation that are not fitting for the role I am privileged to serve. I own that. I have many flaws,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cBeing passionate coupled with an occasional lapse in restraint of tongue are at least two of them. I regret the words I chose, and I apologize for my insensitive comments.\u201d", "But on Feb. 10, Michigan journalist Simon Shuster reported in a tweet that the state senator backtracked on his apology. In his post, Shuster noted that Shirkey \u201cappeared to stand by the assertion that supporters of former President Trump did not instigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\u201d", "\u201cI frankly don\u2019t take back any of the points I was trying to make. Some of the words I chose I do regret,\u201d Shirkey reportedly said. \u201cThe FBI is going to identify here within the next couple of weeks who was actually behind it.\u201d", "Nick Friend, a multimedia journalist with Michigan NBC affiliate WLUC TV6, shared a full exchange of the video that showed Shirkey on the Michigan Senate floor as he continued to claim that the riot was \u201cplanned weeks and months in advance by someone.\u201d Snopes contacted Shirkey\u2019s office by email for further clarification regarding his follow-up comments but did not receive a response at the time of publication. We will update the article accordingly.", "\u201cWhen you get people like that that misrepresent your party, since he\u2019s in a very powerful seat and a very powerful position as a long-term politician, that\u2019s labeled as Republican. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not Republican,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis does not represent us.\u201d", "Madison Dapcevich is a freelance contributor for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
