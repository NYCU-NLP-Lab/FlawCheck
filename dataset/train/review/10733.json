["Federal regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? \"Don't tread on us\" sums up the reaction of GOP Gov. Rick Perry, who's running for reelection.\n\nIn February, the state filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to prevent the regulation of carbon dioxide. Perry has resisted the EPA's finding last year that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health \u2014 a verdict that sets the stage for federal regulation.\n\nState officials say such curbs could jeopardize jobs and threaten businesses in Texas, which leads the nation in carbon emissions.\n\nAs evidence that Texas is doing just fine protecting natural resources, thanks, Perry says Texas also leads the nation in wind power. From a press release the governor issued Feb. 16 announcing the state's lawsuit: \"Texas has installed more wind power than any other state, and all but four countries.\"\n\nDoes Perry have it right?\n\nLet's start with those other states.\n\nAccording to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), a trade group that tracks development in the industry, Texas has the largest installed wind capacity in the country. That means its wind projects are producing more power than any other state. As of 2009, Texas boasted 9,410 megawatts of it \u2014 enough to power about two million-some homes here.\n\nIowa has the second-largest installed wind capacity with 3,670 megawatts of power, followed by California, Washington state, and Minnesota.\n\nIn 2009, Texas installed the largest amount of new capacity with 2,292 megawatts of wind power, trailed this time by Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Illinois.\n\nSo Texas is \u2014 sorry \u2014 blowing the competition out of U.S. waters.\n\nHow does the state fare worldwide? The Global Wind Energy Council, of which the AWEA is a member, reports the United States had an installed wind power capacity of 35,159 megawatts as of 2009. Germany had 25,777 megawatts, China had 25,104 megawatts, Spain had 19,149 megawatts and India had 10,926 megawatts.\n\nItaly was the country with the sixth largest installed wind power capacity (4,850 megawatts) \u2014 just over half of Texas' capacity.\n\nNot including the U.S., Texas had installed more wind power than any all but four countries. And more than any other state.\n\nWe rate Perry's statement as True.", "Office of the Governor, Press release with video: Texas takes legal action against federal government over EPA CO2 mandates, Feb. 16, 2010\n\nAustin American-Statesman, Texas sues EPA over greenhouse finding, Feb. 16, 2010\n\nAmerican Wind Energy Association, Year end 2009 market report, January 2010\n\nGlobal Wind Energy Council, Global installed wind power capacity 2008/2009 (MW), 2009\n\nInterview with Kathy Belyeu, manager of industry information services at the American Wind Energy Association, March 2, 2010\n\nInterview with Kathleen O'Dell, senior communicator at the National Renewable European Energy Laboratory, March 2, 2010\n\nInterview with George Douglas, spokesman at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, March 2, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
