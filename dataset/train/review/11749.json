["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "For all the fun you see people having in beer commercials, the one thing you won\u2019t see is someone actually drinking beer. The Dutch brewer Heineken made this the centerpiece of an ad campaign that features the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.", "In this version, Harris is touting the taste of Heineken Light. The video shoot jolts to a halt when Harris tips a bottle to take a sip only to find that the cap is still on. This exchange between Harris and the director follows:", "Director: \"Cut! Neil, you can\u2019t drink the Heineken Light. Just hold it up.\"", "Harris: \"What do you mean? Why can\u2019t I drink it?\"", "Director: \"There are rules about drinking in the commercial.\"", "Harris: \" \u2018Cause it\u2019s airing during a children\u2019s program or something.\"", "Director: \"No.\"", "Harris: \"Then why?\"", "Director: \"It\u2019s a regulatory thing. We can\u2019t actually show you drinking Heineken Light on camera.\"", "It\u2019s actually a pretty funny ad as Harris gamely and utterly misses the director\u2019s point", "But we wondered about the director\u2019s claim that a \"regulatory\u00a0thing\" stops people from drinking beer in commercials. We\u2019ve seen plenty of beer commercials and just always assumed that someone was drinking at some point.", "The fact is, however, ad makers successfully are getting us to see more than is on screen.", "In case you were wondering, it\u2019s not the long arm of government that\u2019s stopping people from a sip of sudsy brew. A press officer at the Federal Communications Commission, the body in charge of decency and other rules for broadcasters, said FCC rules are silent on drinking on camera.", "\"Congress has not enacted any law prohibiting broadcast advertising of any kind of alcoholic beverage, and the FCC does not have a rule or policy regulating such advertisements,\" she said, citing the agency\u2019s website.", "If there\u2019s an iron fist, it belongs to the broadcasters.", "Tara Rush, senior director of corporate communications at Heineken USA, said the rules come from TV networks.", "\"This is a regulation with the actual TV networks,\" Rush said. \"It\u2019s a long-standing rule.\"", "The broadcasters\u2019 trade group, the National Association of Broadcasters, has no policy itself, but a spokesman sent us articles that describe how each network is free to set its own standards and, as it stands, when it comes to beer, they frown on public displays of ingestion.", "A spokeswoman for The Beer Institute, the voice of brewers, told us their members are loath to take chances with network policy.", "\"If you\u2019re putting an ad together, you will be as conservative as possible so you know it will get past all the networks,\" said Megan Kirkpatrick, director of communications at the Institute.", "Kirkpatrick said the brewers have no desire to stir things up and risk stirring a cry for a new law.", "\"The fact that it is self-regulated now, that\u2019s not something brewers would want to put in jeopardy,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"It\u2019s the way they have operated for decades. You show a lot of people enjoying a football game or enjoying a baseball game but you don\u2019t show any consumption. I don't think you\u2019re going to see that change.\"", "Perhaps.", "Rush left us with this tantalizing thought about the long-standing rule.", "\"Some networks are now beginning to change it,\" Rush said.", "We doubt Heineken is hoping for a quick shift.\u00a0If commercials start showing people sipping away, that Heineken ad will be about as enticing as, well, old beer.", "Our ruling", "A Heineken beer commercial said regulations ban showing someone drinking beer on camera. If you take a more relaxed view of regulations, that\u2019s close to the truth. The rules come from the television networks, not the government. The restriction might not have the force of law but it\u2019s just as effective.", "We rate the claim Mostly True.", "Heineken, 60-second web ad, July 17, 2014", "Beer Institute, Advertising and marketing code", "Federal Communications Commission, The Public and Broadcasting, July 2008", "Adweek, Ad of the Day: Neil Patrick Harris Doesn't Get Why He Can't Drink Heineken Light on TV But here's the explanation, if you're interested, July 18, 2014", "New York Times, Heineken Hopes Star Power Will Do the Trick, July 16, 2014", "Interview, Zamir Ahmed, senior manager, media relations, National Association of Broadcasters, Aug. 18, 2014", "Email interview, Janice Wise, public affairs, Federal Communications Commission, Aug. 18, 2014", "Email interview, David Oxenford, partner, Wilkinson Barker Knauer, Aug. 18, 2014", "Email interview, Lance Strate, professor of communication, Fordham University, Aug. 18, 2014", "Email interview, Tara Rush, senior director, corporate communications, Heineken USA, Aug. 18, 2014", "Interview, Megan Kirkpatrick, director of communications, Beer Institute, Aug. 18, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
