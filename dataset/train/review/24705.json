["By Robert Farley", "Posted on February 5, 2021", "In the debate over competing rescue plans, those in both political parties have miscited a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office to make their case.", "Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that while the statements by Cassidy and Psaki are \u201cboth technically wrong, I think it\u2019s pretty clear they are both trying to say something accurate.\u201d", "Republicans and the White House have proposed very different COVID-19 relief bills, with the Republican plan calling for about $618 billion in stimulus, while the plan proposed by President Joe Biden calls for $1.9 trillion in federal spending. Biden met with a group of 10 Senate Republicans on Feb. 1, and both sides presented arguments for their respective packages.", "In an interview after the meeting, Cassidy said the two sides had a \u201cbit of common ground\u201d in that \u201cwe\u2019re talking from data. What does the data show that we need. And the president\u2019s going to have his staff get back to us, and we\u2019ll kind of compare our data points. That\u2019s good news.\u201d", "In making their cases through data, both sides cited a recently released report from the CBO on the 10-year economic outlook. But as we said, they didn\u2019t always do so accurately.", "One of the differences between the two relief plans is the amount and duration of unemployment insurance supplements. Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan would provide a $400 per week unemployment insurance supplement through the end of September. The GOP proposes that the current $300 per week supplement be extended through the end of June.", "Biden \u201cwants $400; we gave $300. And we phase out in June. Why? Because the Congressional Budget Office says they expect employment to be back to pre-COVID levels by June,\u201d Cassidy said in a Feb. 2 interview.", "In another interview the same day on CNBC, Cassidy said, \u201cCBO is estimating a GDP growth of 3.8% this coming year. CBO is saying that by June, employment will be back to pre-COVID levels, attributing that to these COVID packages we\u2019ve already had.\u201d", "That\u2019s not accurate. According to the CBO report, without any new relief package at all, \u201cthe unemployment rate gradually declines through 2026, and the number of people employed returns to its prepandemic level in 2024.\u201d", "Cassidy\u2019s office said the Louisiana senator in both cases was referencing GDP, not employment.", "That would be accurate. The CBO wrote, \u201cIn its new economic forecast, which covers the period from 2021 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office therefore projects that the economic expansion that began in mid-2020 will continue. \u2026 Specifically, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to return to its prepandemic level in mid-2021 and to surpass its potential (that is, its maximum sustainable) level in early 2025.\u201d", "In a press briefing on Feb. 3, Psaki said, \u201cThe president\u2019s plan would give Americans who are out of work, through no fault of their own, a $400 weekly supplement and the certainty that it would last through the worst of the pandemic. Their plan would give unemployed Americans less money and, therefore, less certainty.\u201d", "We\u2019re not going to weigh in on the politics over the appropriate amount or duration of unemployment insurance supplements. But even if Cassidy had cited the GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels later this year to justify the GOP\u2019s smaller and shorter unemployment insurance proposal, we would have been writing now to clarify that CBO anticipates unemployment recovery to be slower than GDP recovery by several years.", "The same thing happened after the Great Recession when unemployment recovery lagged behind GDP growth.", "Psaki has also cited the CBO report, to justify the size of the $1.9 trillion package proposed by Biden. She argues that without it, the economy will not recover as quickly.", "In her press briefing on Feb. 4, Psaki said: \u201cA CBO report found that without any additional stimulus, our economy wouldn\u2019t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025. And it would take just as long to get back to full employment.\u201d", "She said\u00a0something similar on Feb. 2. Psaki said the CBO analysis showed that \u201cwithout action, our economy won\u2019t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025. That\u2019s too long. So our goal with moving this package forward is making it faster.\u201d", "As we wrote above, the CBO projects that GDP will \u201creturn to its prepandemic level in mid-2021.\u201d Psaki is referring to something else, what the CBO refers to as the economy\u2019s \u201cpotential level\u201d \u2014 which CBO describes as its \u201cmaximum sustainable\u201d level. CBO says GDP won\u2019t surpass that level until 2025.", "\u201c\u2019Potential GDP\u2019 is a measure of how much the economy could produce if we were maximizing our use of labor and capital,\u201d Goldwein, of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, explained.", "\u201cPrior to the pandemic, the economy was at its potential \u2013 actually somewhat above potential based on CBO\u2019s estimates,\u201d Goldwein said. \u201cIn the second quarter of 2020, the economy fell to about 10% below its potential according to CBO. In other words, thanks to the pandemic we were producing and buying 10% less than we could have been.\u201d", "\u201cPotential GDP almost always grows over time,\u201d Goldwein said, but since the second quarter of last year, \u201cactual GDP has been growing faster and so catching up.\u201d", "\u201cCBO estimates the gap shrank from 10.1% at its worst to 3% at the end of last year and will further shrink to 1.3% by the end of this year, 0.8% by the end of 2022, 0.4% by the end of 2023, and 0.015% by the end of 2025,\u201d Goldwein said.", "Although the economy would not reach its potential until the first quarter of 2025, according to CBO, Goldwein noted that it would be \u201cmostly back to normal (within 0.5% of potential) by 2023.\u201d", "In an analysis of Biden\u2019s plan, CRFB calculated that the $1.9 trillion proposal would \u201clikely be enough to close the output gap\u201d between actual and potential GDP \u201ctwo to three times over.\u201d That \u201covershoot could be beneficial\u201d the report states, but the authors also warned it could \u201cpose risks to the economy and the fiscal outlook.\u201d", "\u201cWhile the economy can operate above its long-term potential for periods of time, it cannot do so indefinitely or sustainably,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cOne possibility is that the excess funds are economically ineffective, adding to the debt without improving the economy.\u201d The excess stimulus could also lead to higher inflation, the report states, and could lead to \u201can economic cliff or crash as the stimulus fades.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
