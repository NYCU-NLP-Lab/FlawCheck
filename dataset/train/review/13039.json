["Social media users have been sharing an image of a billboard and encouraging people to boycott China-made products this Diwali season. The text on the hoarding suggests that the message was issued by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). It also features an image of an Indian soldier. The original Hindi message on the sign reads, \u201cI won\u2019t let the Chinese enter our borders, and you shouldn\u2019t buy made in China products this Diwali. Let\u2019s fight together.\u201d This photo has gone viral at a time when India-China tensions escalated, following skirmishes along the LAC earlier in June. The border tensions also prompted the Indian government to ban 224 Chinese mobile applications, citing security concerns.", "Ashwani Mahajan, columnist and national co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, had tweeted the image.
