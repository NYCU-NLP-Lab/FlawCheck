There were also many loans that were on the verge of turning into NPAs. And he (Nitin Gadkari) believes that the government was also at fault here.\u201d", "\u201cIt is clear that resistance has started arising from within the BJP. Till now Yashwant Sinha, Shatrughan Sinha and Arun Shourie raised their voices, but now a leader associated with the RSS is also saying that if the BJP wants to win the next elections, it can no longer just show Prime Minister Modi\u2019s face.

His above-mentioned statement was immediately followed by, \u201cThe government during that time, the UPA government, did not get environment forest clearances for any project in 2.5 years. If you don\u2019t get environment forest clearance, how will one work? Land acquisition was at 5%.
