No sign of any fiction books, just non-fiction regarding history, cultures, wars, tyranny, communism, politics, etc. they are trying to erase history.\"", "One commenter asked: \"How long does this Chinese virus live?\"", "Another replied: \"Just set them aside for a month should be good to go.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
