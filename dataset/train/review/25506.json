["\u201cFacts about masks,\u201d says the title of a\u00a0January 5, 2021 Facebook post. It lists oxygen deprivation, bacterial infection and psychological damage as three dangers that face masks allegedly pose to children.", "The post includes a link to a globalresearch.ca page, which published this transcript of a German doctor\u2019s claims about masks and their adverse effects. AFP debunked her claims here.", "In August 2020, the US State Department described globalresearch.ca as \u201cdeeply enmeshed in Russia\u2019s broader disinformation and propaganda ecosystem\u201d and \u201ca steady source of anti-US and anti-Western disinformation and propaganda.\u201d", "A report by Newsguard, an independent technology company that assesses the trustworthiness of online content, said the website \u201cseverely violates basic standards of credibility and transparency\u201d and \u201chas repeatedly published false information, including unsubstantiated claims in 2020 about the Covid-19 virus.\u201d", "The site has previously published at least two false stories whose claims were both debunked by AFP here and here.", "In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, has recommended the use of face coverings since May 2020.", "Canadian provinces have instituted a range of mandatory mask orders, including on public transport. Masks are also required on airplanes.", "But masks remain a polarizing topic in Canada. Hugs Over Masks, a Canadian anti-mask group, has spread misinformation debunked in this AFP Fact Check. The group also created a \u201cmask exemption form,\u201d which Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, described as \u201cfraudulent\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d", "Below, AFP Fact Check breaks down the false claims about the risks of face masks for children.", "Claim 1: Oxygen deprivation and CO2 poisoning", "Allison Messina, who chairs the Division of Infectious Disease at Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital, told AFP by email that \u201cmasks do not cause oxygen deprivation in children nor (in) adults. Plenty of oxygen gets through and around masks. Children over two can safely wear masks.\u201d", "This was confirmed by Philipp Lepper, a member of the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP) and senior physician at the Saarland University Hospital.", "\u201cSince the amount of air behind the mask is very small and is mixed with fresh air each time you breathe in, this has no effect on the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels measured in the body,\u201d Lepper said in this AFP Fact Check.", "The claim that masks increase the risk of CO2 poisoning was also refuted by Vinita Dubey, Associate Medical Officer of Health at Toronto Public Health.", "\u201cProlonged use of a face mask, including the N95, has not been shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity in healthy people. If CO2 slowly builds up in the mask over time, the levels are low and mostly tolerable,\u201d Dubey said in a separate\u00a0fact check by AFP.", "Claim 2: Bacterial infection", "It is false to claim, as the post does, that in the \u201cwarm and moist environment of the mask, bacteria, virus\u2019 and spores thrive especially well,\u201d making the mask wearer \u201cvery sick.\u201d", "\u201cThere is zero evidence that masks can cause bacterial lung infections,\u201d Sean O\u2019Leary, Vice-Chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 (AAP) committee on infectious diseases, said by email.", "\u201cOur noses and throats contain billions of bacteria, so the additional bacteria that could grow in a mask are a drop in the bucket compared to that. This is absolutely misinformation.\u201d", "O\u2019Leary added that masks may have had a positive impact beyond slowing the spread of Covid-19.", "\u201cWe are seeing dramatic decreases in non-Covid lower respiratory tract infections, probably in large part due to the wearing of masks,\u201d he said.", "Scott Halperin, professor of pediatrics, microbiology, and immunology at Dalhousie University, agreed via email, saying: \u201cThis claim makes no scientific sense.\u201d", "\u201cThose organisms on the inside aspect of the mask are the wearer's own microbiological flora which may contain a pathogen, but only a pathogen that the individual already has,\u201d Halperin said.", "Johns Hopkins\u2019 Messina said the use of masks in medicine and surgery dates back decades, and the risk of bacterial infection from them \u201chas never been an issue.\u201d", "Claim 3: Psychological damage and stress", "The post also claims that\u00a0\u201cpsychological damage\u201d can result when children are unable\u00a0to communicate adequately or recognize emotions, and says that face masks can \u201cfuel anxiety and cause stress.\u201d", "Jennifer Katzenstein, Director of Psychology and Neuropsychology at Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital, said by email that: \u201cMasks are not preventing children from communicating adequately with others, and many, many children have been quite resilient throughout the pandemic and are doing quite well.\u201d", "Rather than masks leading to anxiety and stress, \u201cmisinformation and uncertainty appear to be the primary drivers,\u201d Katzenstein said, also dismissing the claim about emotions.", "\u201cEyes and facial expressions can still be conveyed,\u201d she said.", "Christina Rinaldi, a professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s Educational Psychology Department, said by email that she was unaware of any psychological studies supporting the \u201cfar-reaching claim\u201d in this post.", "\u2018\u201cIt is very difficult to claim \u2018cause,\u2019 so just with that it can be discredited,\u201d she said.", "The AAP\u2019s O\u2019Leary added that \u201cwith widespread mask use, the vast majority of children have adapted very quickly (we hear more complaints from adults than kids for example).\u201d", "\u201cIf a parent has concerns that their child is not adapting well to mask use, they should discuss that with their pediatrician,\u201d he said.", "AFP Fact Check has debunked more than 750 examples of false or misleading information about the coronavirus.
