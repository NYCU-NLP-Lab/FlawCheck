["Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut has been at the centre of media attention since actor Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide in June. Ranaut, who has blamed the film industry and Rajput\u2019s former girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty for his death, has taken it upon herself to bring \u2018justice\u2019 to the dead actor. This has led her to criticise Mumbai police and Shiv Sena\u2019s government in Maharashtra. Following her remark terming Mumbai \u2018Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\u2019, parts of her office deemed illegal by Maharashtra administration were torn down and the actor was provided Y security by the central government. She is now embroiled in a row with chief minister Uddhav Thackery.", "In the backdrop of this never-ending spectacle is the latest social media claim about Ranaut that she partied with criminal mastermind Abu Salem\u2019s brother. This claim is viral along with an image where Ranaut is seated next to a man. Abu Salem has been convicted of multiple crimes, including the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. He was feared in Bollywood for extorting money from film producers and actors and seizing overseas distribution rights. He reportedly worked for Dawood Ibrahim.", "Former Shiv Sena MLA Shishir Shinde posted (archived link) the viral image with the claim that Ranaut was photographed with Abu Salem\u2019s brother. \u201c\u0905\u0930\u0947\u0930\u0947?\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f\u092a\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0939\u094b\u0926\u092f,\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0930 \u092a\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0923\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u0932\u0947\u0932\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u091a\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u0938 \u092a\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0923\u0940 \u0905\u092c\u0942 \u0938\u093e\u0932\u0947\u092e\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094b\u092c\u0924 \u0905\u0936\u0940 \u0928\u0936\u093e \u0915\u0930\u093e\u092f\u091a\u0940?\u0930\u093e\u091c\u092d\u0935\u0928\u091a\u0940 \u0936\u093e\u0928 \u0918\u093e\u0932\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u0940!\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0930\u091a\u0933 \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u0924\u093e\u0924 \u092f\u093e\u0932\u093e,\u201d he wrote in Marathi.", "\u0905\u0930\u0947\u0930\u0947?\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f\u092a\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0939\u094b\u0926\u092f,\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0930 \u092a\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0923\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u0932\u0947\u0932\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u091a\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u0938 \u092a\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0923\u0940 \u0905\u092c\u0942 \u0938\u093e\u0932\u0947\u092e\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094b\u092c\u0924 \u0905\u0936\u0940 \u0928\u0936\u093e \u0915\u0930\u093e\u092f\u091a\u0940?\u0930\u093e\u091c\u092d\u0935\u0928\u091a\u0940 \u0936\u093e\u0928 \u0918\u093e\u0932\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u0940!\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0930\u091a\u0933 \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u0924\u093e\u0924 \u092f\u093e\u0932\u093e! @maha_governor @CMOMaharashtra @AUThackeray @ShivsenaComms @rajivkhandekar @zee24taasnews @ibn_lokmat pic.twitter.com/Op11qkFubJ", "\u2014 Shishir Shinde (@ShishirShinde1) September 14, 2020", "Congress leaders Nagma and former Shiv Sena MLA Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil also shared the viral image.", "This slideshow requires JavaScript.", "The image has also been shared with a message in Bengali\u2014\u201d\u0986\u09ac\u09c1 \u09b8\u09be\u09b2\u09c7\u09ae\u2019\u098f\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 \u098f\u099f\u09be \u09ac\u09cb\u09a7\u09b9\u09df \u0986\u09ae\u09bf\u09b0 \u0996\u09be\u09a8\u0964\u201d", "Alt News received several fact-check requests on our WhatsApp helpline (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.", "Alt News performed a reverse image search on Google and found a 2017 Huffington Post editorial piece that carried the image.
