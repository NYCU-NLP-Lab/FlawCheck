And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world,\" Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. \"To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, \u2018Oh, that's good.\u2019 Now it means, \u2018That's good for jobs.\u2019 Very different.\"", "Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, tweeting: \"Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades.

Experts told us there are nuances.", "Stock market winning streaks", "The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies.", "All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day.", "It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch.", "MarketWatch countered part of Trump\u2019s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn\u2019t \"the longest winning streak in decades.\"", "\"Rather, it\u2019s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century \u2026 In terms of winning streaks, the S&P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That\u2019s according to Dow Jones data,\" wrote MarketWatch\u2019s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.)", "Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump\u2019s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that\u2019s not the sole driver of the stock market highs.", "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says \"wasteful and unnecessary\" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing.", "Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.", "In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he\u2019d like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, \"maybe more.\" He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports.", "\"I would definitely say Trump gets credit,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.

Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that\u2019d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added.", "\"The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down,\" Duy said. \"In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level.\"", "It\u2019s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn\u2019t the dominant factor, Duy said.", "Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks.", "Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017.

Consumers\u2019 assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January,\" Franco said. \"Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months.\"", "Trump certainly isn\u2019t the first to boast about the stock market\u2019s performance.", "In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there\u2019s a Democratic president.
