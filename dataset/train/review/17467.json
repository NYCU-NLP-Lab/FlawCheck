Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require students to show their privates before using a restroom in a public school in Virginia.", "\"Virginia Republican wants schools to check children\u2019s genitals before using bathroom,\" read the headline of a Jan. 12 web post by Occupy Democrats, a group started in 2012 to - in its own words - \"counterbalance the Republican Tea Party.\"", "The ensuing article elaborated that Cole\u2019s bill \"would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their \u2018anatomical sex.\u2019\"", "Similar claims have been posted on the websites of at least two other liberal groups: The Raw Story and Peacock Panache, triggering some Internet debate that isn\u2019t exactly flattering to Cole.", "We wondered whether the description of Cole\u2019s bill is accurate.", "School bathrooms have been a scalding issue in Cole\u2019s district, where some parents have objected to a transgender student\u2019s use of a girls\u2019 lavatory at a Stafford County elementary school.", "Officials at the school initially allowed the student to use the girls\u2019 room. But amid an outcry from some parents, the school board reversed that policy and instead directed the student to use a single-stall lavatory at the school, a staff bathroom, or the boys\u2019 restroom.", "Cole\u2019s bill would direct school boards across the state to develop policies to ensure that any public school restroom and locker room \"designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation.\" The legislation defines \"anatomical sex\" as the \"physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person\u2019s anatomy.\"", "That measure, introduced Jan. 11, does not spell out exactly how school officials would verify a student\u2019s gender.", "Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, and Omar Rivero, the group\u2019s founder, told us in an email that the group \"simply took Del. Mark Cole\u2019s offensive proposal to its logical conclusion.\"", "\"How else would an enforcing official determine whether or not the individual's anatomical sex matches Del. Cole's interpretation of binary gender designation?\" they wrote. \"Are they expecting children or adults to voluntarily turn themselves in? Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? Somebody will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct.\u2019\"", "But as our colleagues at the fact-checking website Snopes.com recently noted, there\u2019s nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom. There are, of course, other possibilities for verification, such as obtaining a doctor\u2019s note, Snopes said.", "To clarify the matter, Cole introduced a second restroom bill Jan. 12 that calls for schools to verify a student\u2019s \"biological sex\" by examining their birth certificate. Both his bills would carry a $50 civil fine for each violation by a student.", "Cole issued a written statement Jan. 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill, which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and can\u2019t use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits. He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district.", "\"Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks,\" Cole wrote. He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a student\u2019s choice of bathrooms. \"If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate,\" he wrote.", "Cole told us on Jan. 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections.", "\"It would be, I think, blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search,\" Cole said.", "Our ruling", "Occupy Democrats said Cole \"wants schools to check children\u2019s genitals before using bathroom.\"", "There is nothing in Cole\u2019s bill that says students will be forced to show their private parts to school officials before they can use the restroom. The group defends its statement by saying \"it\u2019s the logical conclusion\" of legislation that\u2019s silent on how it would be enforced.", "But there are other possibilities the group doesn\u2019t consider. Cole suggests using birth certificates and student records to verify a student\u2019s anatomical gender. The loose writing of the bill, which Cole is trying to tighten, leaves the legislator a little bit open to criticism. But it doesn\u2019t entitle Occupy Democrats to make up a genital inspection claim and attach Cole\u2019s name to it.", "We rate the group\u2019s claim False.", "Occupy Democrats, \"Virginia Republican wants schools to check children\u2019s genitals before using bathroom,\" Jan. 12, 2016.", "Email from Occupy Democrats, Jan. 14, 2016.", "Interview with Del.
