["The June 2018 Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, says the sizeable mansion seen in the photo is owned by Malema and is located in the affluent Johannesburg area of Sandton.", "\u201cThis is house of Julius Malema in Sandton......the same Malema known for fighting for the poor in Alexandria....the same Malema who said he does not want to celebrate his marriage with the poor..!!!\u201d it reads.", "A reverse image search of the mansion leads to numerous articles related to Malema as far back as 2010. The search results include a 2013 article about the sale of his \u201chalf-built mansion\u201d on a popular South African property website.", "The website features the same misleading image of the eye-catching mansion. But as other news articles showed, the half-built mansion owned by Malema remained a construction site at the time -- it was not the completed house seen in the photo.", "In fact, the mansion seen in the Facebook post is a well-known landmark in Bedfordview, an affluent suburb in eastern Johannesburg. The house is known for a fish tank built into the walls that\u2019s visible to the public -- see a blog post here. The property is not in Sandton, to the north of the city, as the Facebook post claims.", "In March 2010, a Johannesburg businessman, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Saturday Star newspaper that he designed the three-storey home and had since posted security guards outside to look out for his family, who he said were being harassed by people who wanted to see \u201cMalema\u2019s house\u201d.", "Years later, Facebook user Alexandra Da Silva issued a plea for people to stop sharing the false information about her family\u2019s home, as they \u201chave no affiliation to Julius Malema\u201d. The post has been shared more than 1,400 times since it was published on December 6, 2018.", "\u201cTHIS IS NOT JULIUS MALEMAS HOUSE? THIS IS STARTING TO GET OUT OF HAND, MY FAMILY LIVES HERE AND IF THIS ISNT STOPPED WHO KNOWS WHAT DANGER THEY COULD BE IN? PLEASE COULD EVERYONE SHARE THIS POST, AND MAKE IT KNOWN THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE LIVE HERE, WHO HAVE NO AFFILIATION TO JULIUS MALEMA.\u201d", "Malema has often been accused of hypocrisy for living a wealthy lifestyle while claiming to represent South Africa\u2019s poorest people --\u00a0as seen in articles here and here\u00a0--\u00a0but he fiercely defends himself against such charges.", "We reached out to the EFF to ask about Malema\u2019s supposed ownership of the home, but have yet to receive a response.", "In December 2018\u00a0Malema confirmed to media that he has a residence in Cape Town, as\u00a0a member of parliament,\u00a0but that his wife was renting a property in Johannesburg from a controversial alleged cigarette smuggler.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
