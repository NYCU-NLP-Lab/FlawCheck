We evaluated several statements from her press release. Here, we're looking at whether the district has\u00a0graduation rates \"substantially higher than the state average\" and dropout rates \"below the state average.\"", "The press release puts it this way: The district \"increased graduation rate of 88.5 percent (Florida calculation) and 85.5 percent (National Governors Association calculation), which are substantially higher than the state average.\" It also \"secured [a] dropout rate of 1.0 percent, which has plummeted below the state average.\"", "State reports show that Fiorentino rightly states the district\u2019s graduation rates, and that they are higher than state averages, which were 81.2 percent and 80.1 percent, according to the two different calculations. Pasco\u2019s rates are also up significantly from 2006-07 on both the state (73.7 percent) and governors association (67.8 percent) measures.", "Pasco also was among a small handful of districts that did not have significant gaps in the rates among its various demographic groups.", "Fiorentino accurately touts the district\u2019s improved dropout rate. State reports show the district dropout rate was 1.0 percent for 2010-11, down from 3.5 percent in 2006-07. The overall state rates were 3.3 percent in 2006-07 and 1.9 percent in 2010-11, so Pasco did show better improvement than the state.", "Fiorentino is on solid ground in these two numeric claims about the district\u2019s academic performance. We rate this claim True.", "Tampa Bay Times,\u00a0Statements by Pasco superintendent Fiorentino touting her record are mostly on the mark, March 4, 2012", "The Committee to re-elect Superintendent Heather Fiorentino, press release, Jan. 6, 2012", "Florida Department of Education, graduation and drop-out rates, accessed March 2, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
