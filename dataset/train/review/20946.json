["About this rating", "On 21 June 2016, a number of Amazon.com shoppers were surprised to find (sometimes sizeable) credits had been applied to their accounts due to a recently settled lawsuit (over unfair competition in the e-book market) that they didn't know about.", "The sudden appearance and relative ease of collection of these credits (customers didn't have to take any proactive steps to claim their shares) led to some skepticism among social media users familiar with the endless parade of online hoaxes and scams offering everything from free plane tickets to free Disney vacations to and free gift cards.", "However, the reports were accurate. Beginning in June 2016, Amazon members could click a link to determine whether they were eligible for (or had already received) credits good for any Amazon purchases. The main settlement page provides both general information and individual credit status:", "Information for 2016 Apple eBooks Antitrust Settlement", "In November 2014, a federal court approved a Settlement of antitrust lawsuits brought against Apple, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) by State Attorneys General and Class Plaintiffs about the price of electronic books (\u201ceBooks\u201d). Those settlements resulted in credits for qualifying Kindle books purchased between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012. These credits are funded by Apple.", "Eligible customers do not need to do anything to receive these credits. If you are eligible, we have already calculated your credit for you and added it to your Amazon account. As long as you have credit remaining we will automatically apply it to your purchase of qualifying items through Amazon.com, an Amazon device or an Amazon app. The credit applied to your purchase will appear in your order summary as a gift card during checkout and in your account history. Eligible customers should have received a notification email from Amazon on June 21, 2016. This credit will expire at 11:59pm PDT on June 24, 2017. You can learn more about the settlements at www.amazon.com/help/ApplebooksettlementFAQs. The credits are subject to these Terms and Conditions.", "Additional information about the lawsuit is available via a 2012 United States Department of Justice (DOJ) press release, as well as a 20 June 2016 release issued by involved lawyers. The DOJ's statement holds that entities party to the suit \"[conspired] to end e-book retailers\u2019 freedom to compete on price, take control of pricing from e-book retailers and substantially increase the prices that consumers pay for e-book, [and publishers] prevented retail price competition resulting in consumers paying millions of dollars more for their e-books\":", "\u201cAs a result of this alleged conspiracy, we believe that consumers paid millions of dollars more for some of the most popular titles,\u201d said Attorney General Eric Holder. \u201cWe allege that executives at the highest levels of these companies\u2013concerned that e-book sellers had reduced prices\u2013worked together to eliminate competition among stores selling e-books, ultimately increasing prices for consumers.\"", "\u201cWith today\u2019s lawsuit, we are sending a clear message that competitors, even in rapidly evolving technology industries, cannot conspire to raise prices,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Sharis A. Pozen in charge of the Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division. \u201cWe want to undo the harm caused by the companies\u2019 anticompetitive conduct and restore retail price competition so that consumers can pay lower prices for their e-books.\u201dAccording to the complaint, the five publishers and Apple were unhappy that competition among e-book sellers had reduced e-book prices and the retail profit margins of the book sellers to levels they thought were too low. To address these concerns, they worked together to enter into contracts that eliminated price competition among bookstores selling e-books, substantially increasing prices paid by consumers. Before the companies began their conspiracy, retailers regularly sold e-book versions of new releases and bestsellers for, as described by one of the publisher\u2019s CEO, the \u201cwretched $9.99 price point.\u201d As a result of the conspiracy, consumers are now typically forced to pay $12.99, $14.99, or more for the most sought-after e-books, the department said.", "The department alleges the conspiracy began in the summer of 2009. CEOs from the publishing companies met privately as a group about once per quarter. The meetings took place in private dining rooms of upscale Manhattan restaurants and were used to discuss confidential business and competitive matters, including Amazon\u2019s e-book\u2019s retailing practices.", "The complaint states that the companies accomplished their conspiracy by agreeing to stop the longstanding practice of selling e-books, as they long sold print books, on wholesale to bookstores, and leaving it to the bookstores to set the price at which they would sell the e-books to consumers. Through their conspiracy, the companies imposed a new model under which the publishers seized e-book pricing authority from all of their retail bookstores and raised prices for e-books.", "As stated in the department\u2019s complaint, one publisher\u2019s CEO said, \u201cOur goal is to force Amazon to return to acceptable sales prices through the establishment of agency contracts in the USA. . . . To succeed our colleagues must know that we entered the fray and follow us.\u201d", "Amazon's appended Frequently Asked Questions page explains the settlement terms and defined eligibility for affected parties:", "Apple, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) settled several antitrust lawsuits about eBook prices that were brought against Apple by a coalition of state Attorneys General, and by a Plaintiff Class. Amazon was not a party to these lawsuits. Under the settlements, Apple provided funds for credits that were applied directly to Amazon accounts of eligible customers in June 2016.

As with the Amazon disbursement, many Ticketmaster customers were pleased to learn that the terms of a settlement entitled those who'd purchased tickets through Ticketmaster.com between 1999 and 2013 to free passes and vouchers for a number of selected concerts.
