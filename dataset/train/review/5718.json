Rather, clicking on the link took readers to a voter registration page on the Vote.gov website.", "Preston's tweet was issued less than a month before the 2018 midterm elections, at the time when a number of organizations, politicians, and celebrities were urging young people to make sure that they were registered  to vote. Although Preston's tweet may have been  deceptive, its apparent purpose was to divert people's focus from arguably unimportant bits of celebrity gossip to their civic duties.", "On 18 October 2018, the official Twitter account for Elle magazine imitated Preston's bit of political misdirection:", "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are splitting up ?? https://t.co/epwKG7aSBg pic.twitter.com/u7qqojWVlR", "\u2014 ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) October 18, 2018", "Again, the link embedded in Elle's tweet did not lead to news about Kardashian and West divorcing, but to a \"Register to Vote\" page on the When We All Vote website.", "In addition to diverting some of the public into thinking about voting, these tweets also highlighted a potentially deleterious habit shared by many social media users: a 2016 study conducted by computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institute found that nearly 60% of people on social media shared links without first clicking them.
