Hours after his resignation, protesters marched and rioters smashed storefronts in downtown Oakland while demanding the district attorney in Alameda County, where Oakland is the county seat, file a murder charge against Mehserle. The district attorney at the time was Tom Orloff, not Kamala Harris.", "Two weeks after the shooting, Orloff charged Mehserle with murder. His trial began in June 2010. David Stein was the prosecutor for the district attorney\u2019s office who tried the case.", "On July 8 of that year, the jury convicted Mehserle of involuntary manslaughter, suggesting that jurors believed Mehserle\u2019s defense that he intended to tase Grant, not shoot him. They also convicted him of \"intentionally\" firing a gun, though a judge later threw that conviction out. Mehserle was sentenced to a minimum of two years in custody but with credit for time served, he was eligible for release about seven months later.", "Harris isn\u2019t named in the Chronicle\u2019s story, which ran less than a month before she declared her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. As a high-profile U.S. senator, her connection to the case would draw attention in an article on the 10-year anniversary of Grant\u2019s death.", "According to a biography of Harris on California\u2019s justice department website, she joined the Alameda County DA\u2019s office in 1990 after graduating from law school. She worked there until 1998, prosecuting child sexual assault, homicide and robbery cases, before leaving to work in the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.", "In 2004, she started her tenure as the first woman district attorney in San Francisco, according to the bio, a post she held until 2010.
