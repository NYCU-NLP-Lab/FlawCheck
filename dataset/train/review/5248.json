Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) began to circulate on social media sites. In it, Warren is framed as hypocritically exploiting programs aimed at Native Americans to achieve wealth and political power. Examples cited included her purported ownership of a $5.4 million mansion and a high-paying gig at Harvard University supposedly achieved solely due to her claim of possessing a small amount of Native American heritage:", "The image (which concluded with a reminder of Warren's positions against concentrating power disproportionately amidst the very wealthy) packed a number of claims into one small statement, the first being the value of Warren's Boston-area home.", "Public real estate records suggest Warren's house is not by any means what one might imagine a mansion to be, boasting a modest four bedrooms and three to three-and-a-half baths.

That being said, I don't know and neither do the viewers know whether she got ahead as a result of that checking of the box, but the only way that we'll be able to find that out is to have her release her personnel records, have Harvard release their personnel records to make sure that she did not have an advantage that others were entitled to.
