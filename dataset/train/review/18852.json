And that he has to be held accountable for atrocities like that.\"", "A hundred years ago, the world had yet to face the horrors of World War I, when nearly 100,000 people were killed by grenades and artillery shells loaded with chemicals like chlorine and mustard gas.

It was worded as a limited agreement, not a moral condemnation. It came before general use of the weapons themselves.", "It was signed by more than two dozen countries, and ratified by all the major powers \u2014 except the United States.", "The American representative to the conference didn't agree to the declaration partly because he thought gas warfare, which had not yet been fully developed, was just as humane as other warfare,\u00a0according to instructions to the American delegates and their official reports.", "But the Hague Declaration\u00a0marked the start of international consensus on the topic, says Richard Price, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia who wrote a book called The Chemical Weapons Taboo.", "\"I think it's fair to say 'international norm' at that point,\" Price told PolitiFact.", "World War I was the first major test.
