The Feds then closed the courtroom doors,\u201d referring to\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.", "But that\u2019s not true.", "Guzm\u00e1n didn\u2019t testify during his trial. His entire defense lasted just one day, according to the docket, and extensive media coverage at the time shows he didn\u2019t take the stand. So, he didn\u2019t testify to anything, let alone that he had made payments to U.S. politicians.", "One person who did take the stand, Colombian drug lord Alex Cifuentes Villa, testified that among the Mexican officials who had been bribed by Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cartel was former Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. But there was no testimony about Pelosi, Schiff or Clinton receiving money.", "The claim is similar to one made in another meme circulating online that we\u2019ve written about. That one alleges that Guzm\u00e1n donated $15 million to Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, a claim that is based on a hoax story published two years ago on a now-defunct website.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "United States v.
