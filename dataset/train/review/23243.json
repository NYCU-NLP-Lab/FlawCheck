["A proposal from U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah poses a conundrum that may be as tough for some as choosing between God, America and apple pie. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nFiscal conservatism or NASCAR?\n\nKingston recently backed a successful amendment to a defense bill that would block the military from spending millions of federal dollars on sponsorships for pro sports teams. He thinks the money should support service members instead.\n\nIf the defense bill passes as amended, it would end the U.S. National Guard\u2019s sponsorship of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nEarnhardt resorted to fightin\u2019 words.\n\nThe day after the amendment passed, he told reporters that Kingston needed to do his \"homework\" on how sponsorships attract military recruits.\n\n\"The Republican from Georgia, he hasn\u2019t even been to a NASCAR race,\" Earnhardt told reporters May 18 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, according to an article in The Sporting News. Other news outlets posted similar accounts of his statement.\n\nThat\u2019s almost as bad as calling Kingston a \"Yankee.\" Could this be true?\n\nThe effort to end military sponsorships of professional sports is a bipartisan affair. Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota offered the amendment, which passed May 17, alongside Kingston.\n\nAccording to Kingston\u2019s office, the Defense Department plans to spend as much as $80.3 million on this type of recruitment advertising this fiscal year.\n\nOther NASCAR drivers are on the military payroll. The U.S. Army backs Ryan Newman. The Air Force sponsors Aric Almirola.\n\nTo Earnhardt, these partnerships are a no-brainer. Kingston is out of line.\n\nWatching NASCAR is as essential to being a Republican politician from the South as going to church or kissing babies.\n\nA reporter at Charlotte Motor Speedway asked Earnhardt whether he would invite Kingston to a NASCAR race.\n\n\"Yes, because he\u2019s a Republican from Georgia,\" Earnhardt said, according to The Sporting News article. \"He ought to have seen a NASCAR race by now.\"\n\nWe called Kingston\u2019s offices repeatedly for more than a week but received no response. Earnhardt\u2019s office didn\u2019t return our calls either. We therefore searched far and wide for evidence that Kingston had attended a NASCAR race.\n\nMaybe we\u2019d find a photograph of the gentleman from Georgia shaking hands with Jeff Gordon or watching the Daytona 500 from the infield, perched on a folding chair atop an RV.\n\nInstead, we found him at just about everything but NASCAR.\n\nWe spotted Kingston on HBO\u2019s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" last year, being berated by the liberal comedian for being a creationist.\n\nOne year before that, Kingston rubbed elbows with President Barack Obama in Air Force One as they flew from Savannah to Washington.\n\nAnd three years ago he appeared on the set of the Miley Cyrus movie \"The Last Song.\" He was an extra for the film, which featured scenes on Tybee Island.\n\nTo our surprise, we also found three news accounts that said Earnhardt was right.\n\nThe Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, said in a May 18 article that Kingston\u2019s office confirmed that he has never attended a NASCAR race. A May 17 article in USA Today said Kingston himself acknowledged it.\n\nA May 22 story in the Savannah Morning News says that Kingston\u2019s never been to a race, but he did display an Earnhardt license plate on the front of his pickup for five years.\n\nIt\u2019s strange but true. Kingston has never been to a NASCAR race.\n\nEarnhardt earns a True.", "Sporting News, \"Dale Earnhardt Jr. invites congressman to NASCAR race to learn more about military sponsorships,\" May 18, 2012\n\nSavannah Morning News, \"Kingston's plan includes stripping NASCAR of military funds,\" May 22, 2012\n\nThe Birmingham News, \"Dale Earnhardt Jr. not happy that some in Congress want to cut military spending on NASCAR sponsorships,\" May 18, 2012\n\nUSA Today, \"House committee vote squashes military NASCAR sponsorships,\" May 17, 2012\n\nSavannah Morning News, \"Savannah welcomes President Barack Obama,\" March 3, 2010\n\nWTOC-TV, \"Miley fans swarm Tybee pier,\" June 24, 2009\n\nThe Huffington Post, \"Jack Kingston: 'I Came From God Not From A Monkey,\u2019\" Jan. 30, 2011\n\nU.S. Rep.
