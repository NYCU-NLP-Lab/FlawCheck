["About this rating", "Former GOP candidate Ben Carson made news headlines in December 2016, when President-elect Donald Trump's transition team announced his appointment as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the incoming administration. Along with the news, a meme (by then at least a year old) began circulating, suggesting that Carson once made a questionable remark about abortions and \"baby ghosts\":", "Abortions create baby ghosts which haunt the hospitals the abortion was performed in. The baby ghosts then steal medical supplies, which is what drives up medical costs. I know this because I'm a doctor.", "We were unable to locate any interviews, transcripts, videos, or other media via which Carson made the attributed remarks or said anything resembling them.
