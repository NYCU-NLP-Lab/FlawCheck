And nothing in the photo makes it immediately obvious that those pictured are actually migrants.", "PolitiFact reached out to The Rogue Patriot for more information regarding the source of the image, and it directed us to an Associated Press story published March 27, 2017. The photo in question appears embedded in the text with the following caption:", "\"Cubans check their cell phones inside the migrant shelter \u2018Casa del Migrante\u2019 in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas state, Mexico, Saturday, March 25, 2017, across the border from Laredo, Texas. The shelter limits migrants to one hour of cell phone usage, for security reasons.\"", "The AP story addresses the so-called \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy, which former president Barack Obama ended Jan. 12, 2017. That policy, created by former president Bill Clinton in 1995, allowed most Cubans who reached U.S. soil to become legal permanent residents after one year. Once it ended, Cuban migrants were treated the same as those from other countries.", "According to the AP\u2019s reporting, many migrants in the Casa del Migrante shelter were Cubans who had tried to travel to the United States under the assumption that they would be included in the \"privileged path\" laid out by the Clinton-era policy. Several had jobs in Mexico that required them to leave the shelter \"to work in restaurants or on construction sites.\"", "That\u2019s a different context than that in which The Rogue Patriot posted its meme. The AP interviewed one migrant who had crossed several borders to get to Mexico, but based on the photo alone, it\u2019s unclear which people pictured actually made a \"two-month excursion across four separate countries.\"", "Similar versions of this meme have cropped up during previous news stories about immigration.", "In December, Snopes fact-checked a meme that used the same AP photo with a text overlay similar to The Rogue Patriot\u2019s post. It found that the post was miscaptioned because it purported to show asylum seekers that were part of a caravan of Central American migrants headed to the U.S. border.", "Finally, we should note that it\u2019s not unusual for poor people or even the homeless to possess cell phones, both in the United States and worldwide.
