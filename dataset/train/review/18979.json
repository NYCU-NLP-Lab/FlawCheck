Biden\u2019s staff told us he was talking broadly about his track record of passing key legislation, not necessarily to have won support from Republicans.", "To the extent this was about bipartisanship, the two bills he picked don\u2019t prove his point.", "When the Democrats took the White House and both houses of Congress in 2009, they inherited a nation on a steep slide into the Great Recession. Their first major act was to pass a bill to kickstart the economy, the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "The bill passed 60 to 38, the number needed to avoid a filibuster, with just three Republican senators voting in favor: Maine\u2019s Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. Not a single Republican in the House backed the bill. Biden pushed for passage; so did President Barack Obama and the rest of the Democratic leadership.", "Republicans said a stimulus was needed. They also said the Democratic package cost twice what was needed.", "\"This is one of the most expensive pieces of legislation Congress has ever approved,\" said then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Feb. 13, 2009. \"This isn't Monopoly money. It is real. It adds up. It has to be paid back by our children and their children.\"", "As for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, the sweeping health care reform bill passed in 2010 with zero Republican votes in both the Senate and the House.", "The bill needed to pass in the Senate with a 60-vote veto-proof majority, which it got. Biden lobbied fellow Democrats to back the measure, but again, so did other Democratic leaders.", "Biden said cited the 2009 economic recovery bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act as proof that he can \"bring the country together.\" At most, those legislative wins show Biden can bring Democrats together.", "The vote totals showed minimal to no bipartisanship. The recovery bill was opposed by every Republican except for three in the Senate. There was no Republican support in either chamber for Obamacare.", "We rate this claim Mostly False.", "Joe Biden, San Antonio rally, Dec. 13, 2019", "U.S. Congress, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Feb. 17, 2009", "U.S. Congress, Congressional Record - ARRA Conference Report, Feb. 13, 2009", "U.S. Congress, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, March 23, 2010", "Interview, Michael Gwin, rapid response deputy director, Biden for President, Dec. 17, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
