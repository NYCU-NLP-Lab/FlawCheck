Islam is the religion that I identify with.\u201d", "This quote was attributed to Trudeau, and shared several thousand times on social media since August 29. It was illustrated by a headshot of the prime minister donning a white head garb reminiscent of a keffiyeh.", "The first iteration of this picture and text together appeared on a Facebook page \u201cJustin Trudeau Not\u201d on August 29. It then migrated to Twitter the next day and was widely shared for the following week.", "The quote most likely originated from an August 28, 2016 article from the Vatican Enquirer, a news website that claims to take a \u201csatirical look at headlines around the world\u201d. However, most articles on the website show no obvious signs of satire and the disclaimer is not accessible from the front page, leaving many people to share the news as true. This particular article was shared nearly 8,000 times according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.", "The article claims that the quote came from the Global Sun, another news website which no longer exists.
