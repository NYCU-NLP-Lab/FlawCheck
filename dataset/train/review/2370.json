["A PAC supporting Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson claims his opponent, former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, was the only 'No' vote on creation of the Department of Homeland Security. (Getty images)", "A TV ad from Let America Work, a single-candidate super PAC that supports Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson for re-election, paints Democratic challenger Russ Feingold as someone who weakened the military during his 18 years in the Senate.", "Feingold, the narrator states, \"voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times\" -- a claim Johnson made that we rated Half True.", "Feingold did vote 11 times against an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that it takes appropriations bills to provide funding. And lawmakers sometimes oppose the annual measure because of policy provisions included in it.\n\nThe ad, released Sept. 1, 2016, continues with words on the screen that say Feingold was the \"only senator to vote against military intelligence\" and the \"only senator to vote against Homeland Security.\"", "The two claims are essentially fleshed out by the narrator saying: \"Feingold voted against the Patriot Act and against creating the Department of Homeland Security.\"", "Feingold is well known for casting the lone vote against the USA Patriot Act, the 2001 anti-terrorism law introduced by U.S. Rep.

The department \"will slowly begin to absorb 22 of Washington's signature functions, including immigration, border protection, emergency management, intelligence analysis and the protection of the president himself.\"", "The roll call vote on the Homeland Security Act shows the measure passed 90-9.", "Feingold was one of the nine, along with fellow Democrats Daniel Akaka of Alaska, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Carl Levin of Michigan and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.", "(James Jeffords, a Vermont independent, also voted no, while Frank Murkowski of Alaska was not present. Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl voted yes.)", "Feingold\u2019s campaign responded to the ad the same day, issuing a statement saying Feingold voted no because the bill contained \"unrelated riders.\" The statement included this excerpt from his book, \"While America Sleeps\":", "Using the same tactics as the drafters of the Patriot Act, the backers knew they could grab a victory on some unrelated agenda because the overall bill was what was known in Washington as a must-pass. Such bills, which Congress has almost no choice but to pass, often attract riders like the one that restricted employees\u2019 rights.
