Medicaid benefits are administered by individual states, and in all states except Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi, test strips are covered by Medicaid and/or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Australians who fall under that category have six months to adjust, and within that time span they can purchase a six-month supply of subsidized test strips. After that, they can get unlimited six-month extensions if a doctor deems it clinically necessary.", "Other than for diabetics on Medicare and Medicaid coverage, the U.S. government does not offer a subsidy for diabetic test strips.", "Hernandez, Vittorio.\u00a0\"Removal of Government Subsidy for Blood Sugar Test Strip Would Mean Type 2 Diabetics in Australia Would Pay $60/100 Strips From $1.20.\"\r\nInternational Business Times.\u00a018 July 2016.", "National Diabetes Service Scheme (Australia).\u00a0\"Important Changes to the NDSS.\"", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\"Basics About Diabetes.\"", "Bethania Palma is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has been working in the news industry since 2006.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
