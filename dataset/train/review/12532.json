["About this rating", "On 5 September 2017, Real News Right Now published a story appearing to report that the United States Treasury had announced plans to introduce a new $20 bill featuring Confederate general Robert E. Lee:", "The new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. \u201cWe are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas,\u201d Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning.", "The article is entirely false and appears to be intended to be read as satire, appearing within the context of a national debate about the removal of Confederate memorials from public spaces across the United States.
