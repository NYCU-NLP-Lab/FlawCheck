["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on May 14, 2020", "Social media posts targeting former President Barack Obama suggest he will be tried for \u201ctreason\u201d and falsely claim that if convicted his title would be \u201cstripped away\u201d along with all his presidential actions.\u00a0 There\u2019s no support for the claim he\u2019ll be tried for treason, and it\u2019s untrue that any former president\u2019s actions would be undone after such a conviction.", "The social media spotlight has turned to former President Barack Obama since President Donald Trump began tweeting about \u201cObamagate\u201d on May 10.", "Trump has long accused Obama \u2014 without evidence \u2014 of directing an illegal FBI investigation into his 2016 campaign for political reasons. But, as we have written before, the Department of Justice inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, examined the origins of the FBI\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and found no \u201cdocumentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation\u201d influenced the opening of the investigation or decision-making during it.", "One recent post that picked up on the \u201cObamagate\u201d buzz began on Twitter, but quickly migrated to Facebook as a screenshot meme, claiming: \u201cWhen a POTUS is found guilty of #Treason, their title of the Presidency is completely stripped away negating every Executive Order, Judge Appointee, \u2018everything\u2019 they had ever done\u2026 Brace yourselves, #Obama is about to make history.\u201d", "But that\u2019s \u201ccomplete nonsense,\u201d Gregory Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told FactCheck.org in an email.", "Two other law professors we contacted agreed.", "There is \u201cno support at all\u201d\u00a0for the claim that a treason conviction would undo a past president\u2019s work, Professor Michael Gerhardt, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told us by email. He said that overturning past actions taken by a convicted former president would require counteractions, such as successful court challenges or new presidential directives.", "Similarly, Alan Morrison, associate dean of the George Washington University Law School, told us that a conviction of treason wouldn\u2019t affect a former president\u2019s actions and, further, he said, \u201cthe notion that he\u2019s going to be tried for treason is laughable.\u201d", "Treason is the only crime that is specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution, which says:", "U.S. Constitution, Article III, Section 3: Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.", "And, according to the National Constitution Center, there have been few treason prosecutions in the history of the U.S. and only one since 1954.", "No president has been convicted of treason, so there is no precedent for it.\u00a0And the post\u2019s claims about the potential impact\u00a0\u2014 that such a conviction would negate \u201ceverything they had ever done\u201d \u2014\u00a0are false.", "\u201cThat\u2019s complete fiction,\u201d Magarian said in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no authority for that.\u201d", "Addressing the claim about federal judges, Magarian explained that once a judge is confirmed by the Senate and takes the oath of office, nothing that happens to the president who appointed him or her would have an impact.", "Also, Morrison explained that once federal judges take office, the only way they can be removed is through the impeachment process.", "\u201cWe are a government of laws, not of men,\u201d Magarian said, explaining that actions taken by presidents have legal authority of their own, and are not an appendage of the person who took the action.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Trump, Donald (@realDonaldTrump). \u201cHe got caught, OBAMAGATE!\u201d Twitter. 10 May 2020.", "Magarian, Gregory.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
