["A two-minute clip of a street play on the importance of social distancing during the pandemic has gone viral. In the play, we can see police officers requesting a Muslim man, who insists on visiting a mosque, to offer prayers at his home. The man doesn\u2019t listen to the police and starts to pray in public. That\u2019s when three men enacting the coronavirus enters the scene and infect the man. Subsequently, the Muslim man is taken by the medical staff and quarantined. The skit ends with a police officer instructing people to do puja or read namaz at home.", "The message shared with the viral video suggests that Bhopal Police claimed that Muslims are responsible for the spreading COVID19.
