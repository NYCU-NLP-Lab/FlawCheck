The ban is set to expire in 2022.", "There have been efforts by some Republicans to expand offshore drilling, but so far they have failed. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La, sponsored The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016 to allow drilling 50 miles off Florida\u2019s Gulf Shores, but the Senate rejected moving ahead on it in November.
