A reader emailed us asking if Behar was accurately describing our rulings, so we took a closer look at the exchange.", "\"Is the media supposed to not report on the fact that 95 percent of what he says is a lie?\" Behar asked.", "\"The problem with that, Joy, is that is, you are doing exactly what we are talking about and pushing a false narrative,\" Sanders replied. \"Ninety-five percent of what the president says is not a lie.\"", "\"No, it\u2019s not,\" Behar said. \"It\u2019s from PolitiFact.\"", "It appeared that Behar was referring to Trump\u2019s PolitiFact file, which tracks every statement we\u2019ve rated on the Truth-O-Meter.

Does that mean he lied 95 percent of the time?", "In a word, no.", "While we appreciate being a part of a discussion about the facts, Behar wasn\u2019t using our file on Trump properly. Let\u2019s take some time to re-examine what the Truth-O-Meter does and doesn\u2019t do.", "There\u2019s no question Trump has a shaky relationship with the truth.", "His campaign misstatements earned our 2015 Lie of the Year award, and his Truth-O-Meter record was much worse than Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.", "His tendency to play loose with facts has continued into his presidency. We\u2019ve given him Pants On Fire ratings for gross distortions saying Charlottesville, Va., counter-protesters didn\u2019t have a permit; that CNN\u2019s ratings have suffered mightily; and that allegations his campaign colluded with Russia \"is a made-up story.\"", "He\u2019s also received False ratings for saying President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policies led to an upswing in MS 13 gang activity; that his own administration did more in the first 90 days than any other presidency; and that he\u2019s saved \"millions of jobs\" since becoming president.", "Overall, he\u2019s earned 147 False ratings (33 percent of all the Trump rulings we\u2019ve made) and 69 Pants on Fire ratings (15 percent).

He was clearly attempting to make it appear he was responsible for the decrease.", "But experts we interviewed said not only did the national debt fluctuate on a regular basis as it continued an inexorable upward climb, there was no way Trump enacted policies leading to the minor (and temporary) drop. We rated Trump\u2019s tweet Mostly False.", "Trump has received 52 Mostly True ratings, 64 Half True ratings, and 93 Mostly False ratings.", "Also keep in mind that a person\u2019s PolitiFact file isn\u2019t a comprehensive look at every single statement they make, nor is it a random sample of what they say.
