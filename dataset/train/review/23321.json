Even so, we have a long way to go before we get to herd immunity. Here\u2019s why.", "Essentially, herd immunity is a numbers game for infectious diseases. The more immune a population becomes, the less likely it becomes for an infected individual to come into contact with a non-immune person and continue the chain of transmission. Herd immunity does not necessarily stop transmission; herd immunity makes transmission less likely.", "Individuals might gain immunity by getting infected. Or, they can get vaccinated, which isn\u2019t an option yet.", "That leaves getting infected, which is not ideal due to the risk of death and known and unknown long-term health effects. However, there\u2019s another problem: Immunity by way of infection might not last long enough because of reported cases of reinfection.", "The known and unknown health risks of the coronavirus in addition to the uncertainty of the immunity render herd immunity infeasible until there is a vaccine.", "Scientists\u2019 estimate that 60% to 70% of the population would have to become infected before herd immunity is reached. For reference, that\u2019s more than 200 million Americans.", "This threshold is where Hartzler\u2019s claim falls apart. At the time of her Sept. 2 claim, 5.8 million individuals had been infected in the U.S., which is around 1.7%.

Cases of reinfection demonstrate that immunity from a prior infection may not be enough if the virus changes enough to render it ineffective.", "Once a vaccine is approved, supply may be limited. Operation Warp Speed aims to accelerate the development, production and distribution of the vaccine, but it will take time to ramp up the supply of vaccine and distribute it. So herd immunity through vaccination is a long way off.", "Hartzler claimed, \"We\u2019re starting to reach almost herd immunity in this nation, so we\u2019ll be on the downside of this virus very soon.\"", "Without a vaccine, herd immunity relies on infections driving immunity.
