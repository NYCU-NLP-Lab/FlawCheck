Animals can also host the virus.", "Bogus claims about CoV being engineered as a biological weapon has already been debunked by multiple platforms both national and international. A statement by public health scientists published in The Lancet says, \u201cWe stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.\u201d", "According to an Al Jazeera report, \u201cChinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally.\u201d This also debunks the second prediction that the novel coronavirus only lives in humans.", "The report adds that Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from \u201can infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins\u201d, which are prized in Asia for food and medicine. \u201cScientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as the source of the virus.\u201d", "The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, \u201cCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.\u201d A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans.", "\u201cCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.

According to the study, COVID-19 can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as 2-3 days. The study also suggests that the virus can spread through the air as well as from touching things that were contaminated by those who are infected as well as through direct human contact.", "They tested the virus by spraying into the air by a nebuliser mimicking the coughing action of an infected person.
