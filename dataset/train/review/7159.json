David Scott, a Democrat who represents portions of metro Atlanta.", "\"It is an abomination that these nominees for lifetime appointment were drafted in secret, not vetted by any legal groups among the president\u2019s supporters,\" Scott wrote in a letter to U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "Scott and others, who\u2019ve supported President Barack Obama on so many issues, felt blindsided by the White House, particularly since the nominees were reportedly chosen after consultation with Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators.", "We wondered if the congressman\u2019s claim was correct.", "U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes was the White House\u2019s pick to serve on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, joining pending 11th Circuit nominee Jill Pryor, an Atlanta attorney.", "To fill four Northern District of Georgia slots, Obama nominated Atlanta attorney Leigh Martin May, DeKalb County State Court Judge Eleanor Ross, Georgia Court of Appeals Judge Michael Boggs and Atlanta attorney Mark Cohen.", "The critics say there\u2019s not enough racial diversity among the nominees.

Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss had held up Obama nominees for years, until a deal struck several months ago finally broke the impasse, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. A spokeswoman for Chambliss declined comment, referring us to a December statement by both senators thanking the White House for its cooperation through the nomination process. The White House press office and Isakson did not respond to requests for comment.", "Scott\u2019s chief of staff, Michael Andel, explained that the White House did not discuss the nominations with Georgia Democrats serving in Congress, which is why the congressman described the process as secret. Andel said the White House did not run the names by organizations that typically vet potential nominees, such as the Georgia Association of Black Women Attorneys (GABWA) or the Gate City Bar Association, a prominent African-American attorney group based in Atlanta.", "Veteran Atlanta attorney and former six-term congressman George \"Buddy\" Darden chaired a 13-member committee in 2009 that was created by Georgia Democrats in Congress to submit nominees to Obama to the federal bench. The committee took input from GABWA and other groups, he said. A year later, the AJC reported that none of the vacancies had been filled.", "Why not? Chambliss and Isakson weren\u2019t thrilled with the names being submitted, according to news accounts.", "In 2013, after Obama\u2019s re-election, Darden said the White House rebuffed their efforts for a meeting. The White House worked with the two Georgia senators and Kenneth S.

Johnson III, a former president of the Gate City Bar Association, gave us a detailed account of negotiations with the Obama administration. Negotiators met with the White House in mid-2010, he said, and the Obama administration made two nominations to fill vacancies on the North Georgia court. Chambliss and Isakson, though, did not support the candidates, Johnson said.", "In August 2013, when rumors surfaced that a deal was in the works, the Gate City Bar Association and other groups wrote Obama to complain they were being left out, said Johnson, a partner at Holland & Knight, one of the most influential law firms in Georgia.", "The White House met with some Georgia Democrats serving in Congress in October. Andel said names of specific judicial nominees weren\u2019t discussed at the meeting. Johnson said his group and others tried, to no avail, to get a meeting with Chambliss and Isakson.", "\"There was no public process for vetting these nominations before they were announced, unlike previous years, in which the president and the senators typically sought input on judicial nominees from leaders and organizations in the community to be affected,\" Johnson said via email. \"I personally met with one of the individuals who was rumored to be part of brokering this package deal. In my meeting I specifically asked whether it would be possible to seek community input regarding this package. I was told that there was no interest in seeking community input, and that those involved in putting this deal together were aware that the deal would draw significant community opposition.\"", "Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said the White House has no formal process when it comes to judicial nominations. Some states, she said, have commissions to vet candidates.

He also claimed groups who traditionally support Obama weren\u2019t in the loop as well.", "This was tough to fact-check because some key people and groups involved in the process wouldn\u2019t talk about it.", "But it appears Scott and the other Democrats weren\u2019t consulted when the White House came up with its nominees.
