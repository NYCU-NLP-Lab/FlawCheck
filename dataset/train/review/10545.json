North Dakota.", "This photograph was not taken in North Dakota, does not show a protest, has nothing to do with an oil pipeline, and is nearly fifty years old. It's actually a picture taken by Barry Z Levine at the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival, showing an \"Aerial view of the massive crowd as they attend the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair in Bethel, New York, August 15-17, 1969.\"", "Hundreds of people have gathered in North Dakota to protest the installation of an oil pipeline, but the size of that crowd pales in comparison to the one shown above.", "Here's an actual photograph of the protest in North Dakota, which has involved members of more than 200 tribes and has fluctuated between crowds of hundreds and thousands of people:", "This photograph was posted to the satirical \"Tyler Eldridge\" Facebook page and is at least the second \"fake\" photograph of the pipeline protest in North Dakota to circulate in September 2016. Another image purportedly depicting the protest actually shows a young woman staring down an officer in riot gear in Chile.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
