["By Catalina Jaramillo", "Posted on March 19, 2021", "A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that state-issued mask mandates were associated with significant decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates. Yet some conservative outlets and social media users falsely claim the study shows mask mandates have a negligible impact on COVID-19 outcomes.", "Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to protect against the coronavirus, although some uncertainty remains as to how effective mask interventions are in preventing spread in the community.", "Lab tests, for example, show that certain masks and N95 respirators can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets or aerosols, which are thought to be the primary ways the virus spreads.", "Observational studies, while limited, have generally found mask-wearing to be associated with a\u00a0reduced\u00a0risk\u00a0of contracting the virus or\u00a0fewer\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0cases\u00a0in a community.", "A\u00a0few\u00a0randomized controlled\u00a0trials have found that providing free masks and encouraging people to wear them results in a small to moderate reduction in transmission, although these results have\u00a0not always\u00a0been statistically significant.", "Masks should not be viewed as foolproof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear the most protective mask that fits well and can be worn consistently. Loosely woven cloth masks are the least protective. Layered, tightly woven cloth masks offer more protection, while well-fitting surgical masks and KN95 respirators provide even more protection and N95 respirators are the most protective.", "Link to this", "The growth rates of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths slowed significantly in counties where states required masks, according to a study that analyzed the impacts of last year\u2019s state-issued mask mandates across the country.", "The findings support the premise that mask requirements help limit the potential exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which therefore reduces the spread of the disease, COVID-19. But conservative outlets and social media users turned those findings around to say the CDC found face masks have a \u201cnegligible impact\u201d on COVID-19 outcomes and that mask mandates \u201cmade no statistical difference.\u201d", "A story published by One America News Network, a conservative cable channel, on March 7, falsely claimed the CDC \u201chas admitted face masks do little to prevent the spread\u201d of the virus and that the numbers in the study \u201cdidn\u2019t exceed statistical margins of error.\u201d The story has been seen by over 230,000 users on Facebook.", "A CDC spokesperson told us that\u2019s not correct.", "\u201cThe data we now have conclusively show that widespread use of masks is a very effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said CDC\u2019s Jasmine Reed in an email. \u201cThe CDC study referenced noted that mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.\u201d", "The new study cites and builds upon previous studies that have confirmed the effectiveness of mask mandates and restaurant closures in reducing COVID-19 outcomes. In this case, CDC scientists examined the association of state-issued mask mandates and on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 1 to Dec. 31, 2020. To do so, it looked at data from 2,313 U.S. counties (73.6% of a total 3,142) where mask mandates were implemented and from the 3,076 (97.9%) U.S. counties that allowed restaurants to reopen, and compared that data with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates.", "The CDC says the study controlled for some variables such as restaurant closures in the mask mandates models and mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models, as well as bar closures, stay-at-home orders, and bans of gatherings. But it did not control for other policies that could affect case and death rates, such as closure of other types of businesses and physical distancing recommendations. It didn\u2019t account for the level of compliance and enforcement of the policies, either, and it did not make a difference between dining conditions, such as indoor or outdoor, in restaurants.", "The study found that mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease in daily COVID-19 case growth rates within the first 20 days. The reductions in growth rates increased with time, reaching 1.1, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8 percentage points within 21 to 40, 41 to 60, 61 to 80, and 81 to 100 days, respectively, after implementation.", "The study also found reopening restaurants was associated with a statistically significant increase in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 41 days after implementation, with 2.2 and 3.0 percentage point increases in the death growth rate 61 to 80 and 81 to 100 days after restrictions were lifted.", "\u201cWhat they found was that one or the other, or both, all of them, were associated with a reduction in incidence rates,\u201d Dr. Sten H. Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview.", "Yet, shortly after the study was first published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report online on March 5, the information got distorted.", "On March 6, Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham tweeted that the study found mask mandates and restaurant restrictions \u201chave a small impact\u201d on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Later that day, an unreliable Twitter account called Breaking911 created a tweet thread about the new study, falsely claiming that it found \u201cmask mandates lower COVID cases by around 1.5% over a two month period.\u201d", "But as we already explained, the study is not showing a decrease in the number of cases and deaths but a decrease in the growth rate of the daily cases and deaths.", "\u201cBecause the growth rate is exponential,\u201d the impact compounds, Jos\u00e9 Luis Jim\u00e9nez, an analytical and atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the study, told us. \u201cSo, it\u2019s kind of like your mortgage \u2014 you change your interest a little bit, and then you save a ton of money. Because the cases compound.\u201d", "The authors of the study did not respond to an interview request from FactCheck.org. But the CDC\u2019s Gery P. Guy Jr., the lead author, told the Associated Press that although those changes in daily growth rates may sound small, they quickly add up.", "\u201cEach day that growth rate is going down, the cumulative effect \u2014 in terms of cases and deaths \u2014 adds up to be quite substantial,\u201d Guy told the AP.", "For example, if cases were growing at 5% per day and that growth rate dropped to 3.5% per day, the total number of cases could shrink substantially, particularly over time.", "Vermund told FactCheck.org since the results show changes in the daily growth rate they are \u201cmuch more impressive\u201d than they may appear.", "\u201cThis is actually quite a large effect, the opposite of what the scurrilous journalist said,\u201d Vermund told us, referring to the OAN story.", "Neysa Ernst, nurse manager at Johns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s biocontainment unit, told us the study results are not only statistically significant, but also clinically significant. She\u2019s been on the front lines of caring for COVID-19 patients and says every percentage point change means a lot for units like hers and overwhelmed emergency departments across the country.", "\u201cEvery percentage point has someone\u2019s family member attached to that,\u201d she said in a phone interview.", "OAN News, and other posts published during the last two weeks, also falsely claimed that the results of the study were \u201cinside the margin for statistical error\u201d or that \u201cmask mandates made no statistical difference.\u201d They misunderstood a line of the study that says \u201cdaily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.\u201d", "But the \u201creference period\u201d is 20 days before implementation of mask mandates.", "The cherry-picked quote from the study merely says there wasn\u2019t a significant difference in the daily case and death growth rates during three time periods before implementation, not after. As Guy explained to the AP, the study looked at growth rates before implementation to make sure there wasn\u2019t already a trend happening before the mask mandates were put into place.", "The study did find \u201cstatistically significant decreases\u201d after implementation of the mandates.", "Vermund said these so-called pre-post analyses, which look at trends before and after you change something, are a very common way of looking at whether an intervention in a community did benefit or harm. The problem with them, he said, is that there may be other factors in the community that also change at the same time. But he said that\u2019s less of a problem when you are looking at short timeframe, like this study does.", "The OAN story, with the headline \u201cCDC: Face Masks Don\u2019t Prevent COVID-19, Study Finds Masks Have Negligible Impact On Coronavirus Numbers,\u201d misinterprets the study even further by claiming the growth rate reductions apply to mask efficacy.", "\u201cThe masks were 0.5 percent effective in the first 20 days of the mandates and less than 2 percent effective after 100 days,\u201d it says.", "But the CDC spokesperson said \u201cthe study did not examine the effectiveness of masks.\u201d", "Vermund said the lack of the actual number of cases reduced or lives saved by mask mandates makes the CDC study a little difficult to understand for the public. Still, he said, the OAN story was \u201ccompletely misrepresentative.\u201d", "\u201cThey don\u2019t understand anything about epidemiology,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that you see a significant slowing of the growth rate in such a minuscule length of time \u2014 that\u2019s not negligible.\u201d", "Jim\u00e9nez, who is an expert in aerosols and has been working since the beginning of the pandemic to demonstrate that the virus travels through the air, told us the results of the study are significant and important because it looks at the general public, instead of results in a laboratory.", "The results would have been even stronger, he said, if people had used masks in a more effective way early on. But the science of face masks has slowly evolved, and the study analyzed data from last year when most of the population was not using masks properly. Still, he said, the results are robust.", "\u201cMasks are essential,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cAnd how could they not be for a virus that we breathe in.\u201d", "Vermund agrees. He said there\u2019s no question about the efficacy of masks in reducing COVID-19, based on what he called overwhelming evidence from other studies. What\u2019s interesting about this study, he said, is to see that in a real-world setting.", "\u201cThis was just sort of a real-world assessment that in real world use, the way people use or misuse masks, is it really worth it? And the conclusion is that it\u2019s definitely worth it because you reduce the speed of growth of the epidemic, you start to blunt the magnitude of the epidemic,\u201d he said.", "The CDC recognized the study\u2019s limitations; nonetheless, it concludes that policies that require universal mask use and prohibit dining at restaurants are important tools, along with \u201cother public health strategies,\u201d to reduce the spread of COVID-19.", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
