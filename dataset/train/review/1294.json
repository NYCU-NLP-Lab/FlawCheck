["Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is comparing his struggles to those of President Ronald Reagan so often it\u2019s turning into a habit.\n\nThe former West Georgia College history professor said June 22, during a speech at the Atlanta Press Club, that on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary, \"the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan\u2019s staff quit.\" We ruled his claim Mostly True.\n\nGingrich recycled the historical tidbit that same day before a crowd near Baltimore and to Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, both times in slightly different ways that hewed close to the truth.\nBut the Truth-O-Meter's dial began to spin when it got word of what Gingrich said June 27 on Fox News\u2019 \"Your World With Neil Cavuto.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nCavuto asked Gingrich how he will fight the perception his campaign is \"rudderless\" and assure voters that he can get his campaign on track.\n\n\"Well, first of all, by not being distracted, but focusing on substance and talking about the solutions we need as a country, and second by reminding people that Ronald Reagan had exactly the same challenges in 1980 -- John McCain had exactly the same challenges in 2007,\" Gingrich said.\n\nRonald Reagan had \"exactly the same\" challenges in 1980 as Newt Gingrich does?\n\nWe rated his earlier statement Mostly True because on balance, Gingrich\u2019s claim squared with history. At about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Reagan met with campaign manager John Sears and two other top staffers in his hotel suite. Reagan and others blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses.\n\nReagan handed Sears a news release that announced the campaign\u2019s new manager was future Central Intelligence Agency head William Casey. It said Sears had resigned to return to his law practice. \u00a0\n\nSears got the message and left, as did staffers loyal to him.\n\nGingrich\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t perfect. But yes, many of Reagan\u2019s top aides left the campaign on the day of his blowout victory in New Hampshire.\n\nStaffers left Gingrich\u2019s campaign under very different circumstances.\n\nNews accounts said Gingrich\u2019s high command rebelled after disagreements on the direction of the campaign. The Associated Press, which broke the story, described the dissent as a \"rebellion.\"\n\nOn-the-record accounts indicate Gingrich did not orchestrate these departures as Reagan did in 1980. Staffers left of their own accord because they disagreed with the direction of the campaign.\n\nThe departures started May 31, when Will Rogers, Gingrich\u2019s Iowa political director, resigned. Rogers told The Des Moines Register that he thought Gingrich wasn\u2019t campaigning or fundraising hard enough. Gingrich\u2019s departure for a luxury vacation in the Greek isles was the last straw.\n\nFormer staffers Rick Tyler, Gingrich\u2019s longtime spokesman, and the campaign\u2019s Iowa director Craig Schoenfield both told The Boston Globe after they left that they and others resigned after a series of meetings involving top-level campaign aides. \u00a0\n\nSchoenfeld told Politico that staffers couldn\u2019t convince Gingrich to run a more labor-intensive campaign.\n\n\"To be successful in Iowa you need to be here [and] taking a look at the way the schedule was, he\u2019s not scheduled to be here in June at all and he\u2019s got very few appearances in July,\" Scoenfeld said. \"You need to make sure that you give yourself a chance to be successful.\"\n\nTyler told the National Journal that staffers made up their minds to resign June 9, the day the news broke.\n\nThere are other glaring differences between the Gingrich and Reagan departures. Reagan switched staff during the primaries, as his campaign gained steam. \u00a0\n\nGingrich\u2019s staffers left at a low point, after embarrassments on Medicare policy, his vacation to the Greek Isles, and news he held massive credit accounts at the jeweler Tiffany\u2019s. The primaries are still eight months away.\n\nReagan lined up replacements before he pushed out his old staffers. Ten days after Gingrich\u2019s staff left en masse, The Des Moines Register reported that Gingrich had yet to replace his Iowa staff.\n\nAt the Atlanta Press club, Gingrich referenced Reagan campaign history to drive home the fairly vanilla point that \"campaigns go up and down.\"\n\nOn Fox News, his point that he had \"exactly the same\" problems as Reagan in 1980 is outrageous self-flattery.\n\nReagan was on an upswing when his staffers left. Gingrich\u2019s campaign is in a rut.\n\nReagan had replacements ready. Gingrich did not.\n\nReagan pushed out his staffers to run a more competitive campaign. Gingrich\u2019s left him because they thought he wouldn\u2019t do what it takes to win.\n\nGingrich started off in Atlanta with a statement about Reagan that was close to the truth, but as he repeated it, he embellished the facts so much that only a kernel of truth remained. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nGingrich might wish he had Reagan\u2019s problems.
