["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on January 4, 2019", "Democrats say the Trump administration is asking for more money for a border wall even though it has spent only 6 percent of the funds that Congress has appropriated for border security over the past two years. That\u2019s misleading. About 60 percent has been awarded to contracts.", "This talking point raises wonky aspects of the federal budget process. But Democrats gloss over the fact that most of the money has been obligated and most has been specifically awarded to contracts.", "Andrew Meehan, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told us that \u201cCBP has obligated more than 90% of the funds provided in FY 2017 and 2018.\u201d An \u201cobligation\u201d is \u201c[a]\u00a0definite commitment that creates a legal liability,\u201d according to the Government Accountability Office. \u201cAn agency incurs an obligation, for example, when it places an order, signs a contract, awards a grant, purchases a service, or takes other actions that require the government to make payments to the public or from one government account to another,\u201d GAO explains.", "More specifically, \u201cnearly 60% of those funds are obligated onto a contract \u2013 referred to as contract award \u2013 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\u201d Meehan said. The expenditure occurs after the work is completed, \u201cmaking expenditure an inaccurate measure of execution,\u201d he said in an email to FactCheck.org.", "The Democrats focus only on those actual expenditures. In an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Dec. 23, Sen. Jeff Merkley said the president was \u201csitting on over $1 billion, 94 percent of what we sent him last year for border security he hasn\u2019t bothered to spend. If you\u2019re not going to spend nine out of 10 dollars on an issue, you obviously don\u2019t care about it that much. This is politics, not policy.\u201d", "But the president wasn\u2019t \u201csitting on\u201d all of that money. Some actions had been taken to transfer funds to the Army Corps of Engineers and further to award contracts. When we asked Merkley\u2019s office about that, spokeswoman Martina McLennan responded: \u201cOf the $1.3 billion Congress appropriated in FY18, as of the latest data Congress received from the Administration on November 26th, only 6 percent has been \u2018expended,\u2019 a term which means the same as \u2018spent.\u2019 While the Administration argues they have signed contracts with companies for more of the funds, those contracts do not mean funds have been spent, and construction has not yet even started on any of the projects obligated for the $1.3 billion Congress appropriated in FY18, which ended in September.\u201d", "Let\u2019s go through the numbers, provided by CBP.", "The fiscal year 2017 and 2018 appropriations included a total of $1.7 billion to CBP for new and replacement border fencing and barriers. And nearly all of that has been obligated to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. About $300 million is yet to be awarded to a contract, but was on hold during the government shutdown, Meehan said. And there was $175 million left for CBP \u201cproject management\u201d support.", "Specifically, of the $341 million appropriated in fiscal 2017, $300 million was on contract by late December 2018, and 35 of the 40 miles of scheduled replacement pedestrian and vehicle barriers had been completed. The fiscal 2018 appropriations included\u00a0$1.375 billion for 82 miles of new and replacement barriers. By July 2018, CBP had obligated \u2014 essentially transferred \u2014 $1.2 billion to the Army Corps. And by Dec. 31, 2018, nearly $700 million of that had been awarded to contracts.", "The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote about this issue on Jan. 3, tracing the Democratic talking point back to a Dec. 10 statement by Sen.\u00a0Patrick J. Leahy. A member of Leahy\u2019s staff told the Post that the obligations to the Army Corps amounted to just \u201ca bureaucratic shift to another government agency.\u201d But then, of course, there are the actual contract awards.", "CBP says nearly 60 percent had been awarded to contracts, and that\u2019s documented by various CBP press releases on such contracts, as the Fact Checker noted.", "McLennan, in Merkley\u2019s office, argues that the lack of actual expenditures shows the administration is \u201cseverely backlogged in their ability or interest in actually doing this work, which again begs the question why they would need $5 billion more for FY19.\u201d But CBP\u2019s Meehan told us the fiscal 2018 funds were obligated in less than nine months, a period of time he called \u201cthe equivalent of light speed in the federal contracting world.\u201d", "In fact, the 2018 appropriations bill was belatedly signed into law on March 23, 2018 \u2014 that\u2019s nearly six months after fiscal 2018 started on Oct. 1, 2017.", "Joshua Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that advocates fiscal responsibility, told us this is one of the problems with the budgeting process. Agencies face difficulties when there are continuing resolutions and late passage of appropriations bills, \u201csometimes so late in the fiscal year, it\u2019s almost impossible to get things done in that fiscal year.\u201d", "Gordon says while the Concord Coalition primarily looks at outlays \u2014 which occur when the checks from the government actually clear \u2014 in this mini-controversy, the contracted amount \u201cmakes the most sense as a measuring stick.\u201d", "One \u201cpiece of irony,\u201d he notes, is that \u201cit seems like the government shutdown is actually going to hamper the ability to get some of these contracts done.\u201d", "Meanwhile, President Donald Trump\u00a0claimed in the Jan. 2 cabinet meeting that he and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had instituted a new system to not pay government contractors if their work was unsatisfactory.", "\u201cSomebody said that we didn\u2019t spend the money,\u201d the president began. \u201cWell, we have spent it, but we don\u2019t pay contractors before they finish the job. That\u2019s one of the other things that Pat and I sort of instituted. We like to have people do the work. \u2026 We pay it when it\u2019s finished so they do a good job. This way, if they don\u2019t do a good job, we don\u2019t pay them.\u201d", "We asked the White House press office if and when the president had instituted such a new policy, and we didn\u2019t receive a response.", "But the president had a point when he said, \u201cnot all of the money has been paid, but the money has been used.\u201d About 60 percent has been awarded to contracts.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
