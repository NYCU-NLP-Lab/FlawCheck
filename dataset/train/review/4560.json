["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 8, 2020", "Viral posts wrongly suggest that the COVID-19 death toll is exaggerated because \u201cthe state\u201d has instructed that \u201canyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident\u201d be listed as a coronavirus victim. Experts say there is no such default classification \u2014 and that the U.S. death count is probably underestimated.", "Many experts believe the number of deaths linked to the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is likely higher than the figures available \u2014 due to factors such as an insufficient number of tests and inconsistent reporting across locales.", "One Facebook user has claimed the opposite, erroneously suggesting the count is being inflated by unrelated deaths, and copies of that claim have gone viral on the social media platform.", "The repeatedly shared posts \u2014 citing the user\u2019s purported recollection of a woman\u2019s claim on a \u201clive broadcast\u201d \u2014 argue that \u201cthe state\u201d has instructed \u201cthat anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident\u201d should be \u201clisted as covid 19 victims.\u201d It claims \u201cthe numbers are a lie\u201d and calls for an investigation.", "We attempted to contact the user responsible for the original post, to no avail, so we don\u2019t know what \u201cstate\u201d was being referenced. But there\u2019s no evidence that any state has adopted a policy to classify all deaths, regardless of the individual circumstances, as being related to COVID-19.", "Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, called the allegation \u201cridiculous.\u201d", "\u201cDeath certificates are basically federal, and each state has a public health division that answers to the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for death certification,\u201d Aiken, the Spokane County, Washington, medical examiner, told us in an email. \u201cFor all practical purposes death certification is directed by the feds, via health departments.\u201d", "Contrary to the Facebook posts, Aiken said, \u201cMedical Examiners and Coroners certify hundreds to thousands of deaths each year, using investigation, autopsies, and medical tests as required, and do not choose a \u2018default diagnosis\u2019 such as COVID-19.\u201d", "Aiken pointed out that CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. The latest guidance was issued April 2.", "\u201cIf COVID\u201319 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the [underlying cause of death], as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\u201d the guidance says. \u201cIn these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.\u201d", "The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 \u2014 or, if a test isn\u2019t available, \u201cif the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d It further indicates that if a \u201cdefinitive diagnosis cannot be made \u2026 but it is suspected or likely \u2026 it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as \u2018probable\u2019 or \u2018presumed.'\u201d", "One hypothetical example cited by the CDC is an 86-year-old woman dying after exhibiting symptoms such as a high fever, severe cough, and difficulty breathing, \u201cafter being exposed to an ill family member who subsequently was diagnosed with COVID-19.\u201d The CDC says that \u201cprobable COVID-19\u201d may be listed as the underlying cause of death \u2014 a deduction made \u201cgiven the patient\u2019s symptoms and exposure to an infected individual.\u201d", "There was renewed attention given to the theory of the death toll being inflated after Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said during an April 7 press conference that \u201cif someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.\u201d", "Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner of New York City and a high-profile pathologist, told Fox News that it\u2019s reasonable to include people with the virus, who also had other health issues, in the count.", "\u201cIn the normal course, autopsies would then determine whether the person died of the effects of the COVID virus, whether the person had a brain tumor or brain hemorrhage for example that might be unrelated to it and what the relative significance of both the infection and the pre-existing disease is,\u201d he said. Even if the number of autopsies being conducted are low because of concerns of infection, he said, \u201cthen you will include in those numbers some people who did have a pre-existing condition that would have caused death anyway, but that\u2019s probably a small number.\u201d", "Likewise, Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told us in an email: \u201cThere are going to be some people who die of something else, happen to have COVID and get tested, and get counted as COVID deaths but would die anyway. It would be wrong to say that number is zero. However given current testing shortages and protocols, the number of such cases will be small.\u201d", "\u201cA greater issue is errors in the other direction \u2014 deaths caused by COVID that are not counted as such,\u201d he said.", "Lipsitch cited at least two reasons for that underreporting: Someone having and dying from clear COVID-19 respiratory symptoms but never being tested (especially early in the epidemic, when tests were scarce). Or, he said, someone dying from causes, such as a heart attack or stroke, triggered by the infection \u2014 with no one ever suspecting or testing for the disease.", "This is not an isolated issue: A 2013 study of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. found that lab-confirmed tests accounted for only about 1 in every 7 deaths attributable to the disease.", "\u201cSo overall it seems likely that while a few individuals who would have died anyway are getting called COVID deaths, there are [many] more deaths caused by COVID that are not being attributed to COVID,\u201d Lipsitch said. And it is \u201csimply not true that anyone who dies of something other than a car accident or gunshot wound is attributed to COVID.\u201d", "In New York City, an epicenter for the outbreak with more than 4,000 reported deaths, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had not been counting the many deaths happening at home if the individuals had not been confirmed to have the disease. After a WNYC and Gothamist report on a sharp increase in the number of daily deaths happening at home in the city \u2014 and the suspected undercounting of cases \u2014 city officials said they would begin to include suspected cases in their counts.", "Gary Watts \u2014 the coroner for Richland County, South Carolina, and president of the International Association of Coroners & Medical Examiners \u2014 also told us that the notion that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are somehow being inflated didn\u2019t make sense to him.", "Watts said in a phone interview if an individual with a pre-existing condition, such as a heart disease or COPD, gets the virus, \u201cCOVID-19 is going to be a very detrimental complication to your already existing disease.\u201d Someone could live for years with COPD, for example, then die within weeks after getting COVID-19. In such cases, when the person is confirmed to have the virus, COVID-19 would be listed as a contributing factor.", "In terms of known COVID-19 related deaths in hospitals, Watts said hospitals certify deaths and report that information. He said his office is only conducting postmortem tests for COVID-19 in limited cases \u2014 if the decedent was healthy, for example, and family indicated he or she had COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.", "Watts said the purpose is to determine the cause of death but also \u201cas a safety precaution for the first responders\u201d who had contact with the individual. But if there was a clear cause of death \u2014 say, a stabbing \u2014 with no relation to COVID-19, Watts said he would not include the disease, even if the decedent tested positive.", "\u201cIf it was not related to the cause of death, then I\u2019m not going to list it,\u201d he said.", "As of April 8, there have been more than 14,000 COVID-19 related deaths reported in the U.S., according to a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.", "\u201cThe true facts are that COVID-19 deaths will likely be underreported on death certificates and not over-reported,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cThis will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount. Not all jurisdictions are able to test home deaths with typical symptoms for COVID-19.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
