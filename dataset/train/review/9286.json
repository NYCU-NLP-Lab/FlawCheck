In fact, the current amount of protective gears such as face masks and protective clothing given to front-line Police officers can barely meet their daily operational needs, and the Force has not hoarded any internal resources. The Police have been frugal and prudent in utilizing their finite supplies, and will ensure that emergency services provided to citizens remain unaffected under existing circumstances.\u201d", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
