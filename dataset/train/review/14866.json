Lamar Smith said that, after\u00a0national security agencies, \u201cNASA\u00a0received the most favorable budget request from the Trump administration.\u201d True, but President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 proposal would still cut NASA\u2019s budget by about 3 percent compared with the agency\u2019s\u00a0enacted budget for 2017.", "Smith, the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space & Technology, made his claim during a hearing on planetary missions.

Other than national security agencies, NASA received the most favorable budget request from the Trump administration. As a result, we can look forward to NASA undertaking a bold and ambitious agenda.", "Trump\u2019s budget is a proposal that Congress will consider in passing its own funding appropriations bills.", "We reached out to Smith\u2019s office for clarification on what the chairman meant by \u201cmost favorable.\u201d The House science committee\u2019s press secretary, Thea McDonald, pointed us to a May 23 Washington Post article.", "According to the\u00a0newspaper, Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal would cut NASA\u2019s budget\u00a0by roughly\u00a01 percent \u2014 from about $19.2 billion to about $19.1 billion \u2014 the smallest reduction among\u00a0the agencies that would\u00a0receive cuts.
