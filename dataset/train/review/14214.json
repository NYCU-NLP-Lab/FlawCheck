The hospital has yet to respond to a request for comment.", "AFP Fact Check breaks down the misleading tips below.", "\u201cDrink lots of hot liquids - coffees, soups, teas, warm water.

And detergent or soap kills it but you must take bath or shower when you get in from the street. Avoid sitting down in your home and go straight to the shower.

The virus enters the system through the throat but will sit in the throat for 3-4 days before it passes into your lungs,\u201d the post says.", "But \u201csymptoms only happen once the virus is already replicating and overwhelming the immune system, so the virus does not sit in the throat for 3-4 days doing nothing,\u201d according to Brown.", "The WHO says the COVID-19 incubation period, which is the time between catching the virus and showing symptoms of the disease, ranges from one to 14 days, but is most commonly around five days.", "Some versions of the list include an additional tip: \u201cExperts suggest doing this simple verification every morning: Breathe in deeply and hold your breath for 10 seconds.
