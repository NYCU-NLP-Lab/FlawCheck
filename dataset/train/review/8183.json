["About this rating", "The death of Fidel Castro on 25 November 2016 was one of the year's many history-making events, occurring just weeks after Donald Trump's surprise presidential win on 8 November 2016.", "Immediately after Castro died, a joke emerged that Castro had once quipped he would not die until \"America was destroyed.\" Later versions of the \u00a0were typically accompanied by a photograph of a smiling or laughing Trump.", "The joke was not the first that involving Castro. In 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama initiated the process of restoring diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba; not long afterward, a meme suggested (in both English and Spanish) that the Cuban leader had once said that such an event would only come to pass when the U.S. had elected a black president and the Vatican had chosen an Argentinian to be the next Pope:", "The death of former Attorney General Janet Reno was incorporated into a variation of the same gallows humor. Reno passed away on 7 November 2016, one day before Trump won the Presidency. Immediately (and predictably), jokes appeared suggesting that Reno had once said Trump would never be president \"in her lifetime,\" or \"over her dead body.\" Like many attempts at humor of that nature, the joke moved swiftly; like the earlier Castro and Reno \"quotes,\" we found no mention of the statement existing before their deaths.", "Cline, Seth. \u00a0 \"10 Things You Didn't Know About Pope Francis.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 U.S. News & World Report. \u00a0 14 March 2013.", "WhiteHouse.gov. \u00a0 \"Charting A New Course On Cuba.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 31 March 2015.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
