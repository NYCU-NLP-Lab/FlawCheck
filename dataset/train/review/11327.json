Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that \u201cin this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.\"", "\u201cWell, we\u2019d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you\u2019re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God\u2019s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord\u2019s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God\u2019s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker\u2019s good name.\u201d", "Articles on\u00a0Newslo typically include a mixture of truth and fiction.
