["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A Democrat hoping to oust U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan recently criticized the Republican congressman\u2019s record on supporting homeless veterans.\n\nShelley Adler is vying for Runyan\u2019s seat representing New Jersey\u2019s third congressional district, which includes Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. During an interview on NJTV\u2019s \"On the Record\" that aired May 4 host Michael Aron asked Adler how her opponent let veterans down if he\u2019s lauded for his representation of that military base.\n\nAdler said two issues were at play: active-duty military personnel and veterans.\n\n\"With respect to veterans who are no longer active duty, they are out of service, we owe much more of a duty to the veterans of our country than we have been showing at all. And I think the disrespect by voting to end programs to aid homeless veterans particularly when that population is increasing,\" Adler said, before Aron jumped in to ask her whether she was referring to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.)\u2019s budget proposal.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t. Adler\u2019s campaign spokesman Michael Muller pointed to a budget appropriations bill passed by the Republican-controlled House on Feb. 19, 2011 to back Adler\u2019s claim.\n\nRunyan as well as 234 of his fellow Republicans voted for that bill, which did not fund 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. But the bill continued funding for roughly 30,000 vouchers issued in previous years.\n\nThe vouchers, which help homeless veterans by subsidizing a portion of their rent, are part of a program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nEach year from 2008 to 2010, Congress approved $75 million in funding for approximately 10,000 new vouchers for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, or HUD-VASH. Funding for existing vouchers is renewed every year.\n\nThe GOP bill in 2011 had no impact on the existing vouchers, according to Donna White, a HUD spokeswoman. \"Any future funding would be on the line,\" White said, but \"existing funding would be protected.\"\n\nAnd ultimately, Congress funded new vouchers that year.\n\nA compromise bill provided $50 million, instead of $75 million, in funding for vouchers for the fiscal year. Runyan voted for that bill, which the president signed into law.\n\nMuller, Adler\u2019s campaign spokesman, said, \"this is still a case that Runyan voted to defund the program with no guarantee that a compromise would bail out his bad vote based on these facts.\"\n\nA Runyan spokesman pointed out that the congressman also voted for an additional $75 million for vouchers in fiscal 2012, which PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that during the 2011 debate Republicans argued the program had unused vouchers that should be issued before the government funded new ones.\n\nSome Democrats disagreed.\n\nFactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, looked at two claims in the wake of the vote: a Democratic claim that the GOP bill would leave 10,000 homeless veterans out on the streets and a Republican claim that 11,000 vouchers were \"waiting\" to be used. \u00a0\n\nThe fact-checking group found in April 2011 that neither claim was accurate.\n\nAt that time, the program had about 2,400 unclaimed vouchers, enough, FactCheck.org found, to make it through the rest of the fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2011.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a television interview, Adler said her opponent voted to \"end programs to aid homeless veterans.\"\n\nRunyan voted for a bill that did not include funding for 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. The bill would have had no impact on existing vouchers.\n\nThe bill wouldn\u2019t have expanded the program, but it wouldn\u2019t have ended it. And Runyan ultimately voted for another bill, which became law, that included funding for new vouchers.\n\nWe rate Adler's statement False.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "NJTV, \"On the Record,\" May 4, 2012\n\nInterviews by phone and e-mail with Michael Muller, campaign spokesman for the Shelley Adler, May 16 & 17, 2012\n\nInterviews by phone and e-mail with Donna White, spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, May 16 & 21, 2012\n\nNational Coalition for Homeless Veterans, House Cuts 10,000 New Housing Vouchers for Homeless Veterans in FY 2011, March 1, 2011\n\nInterview with Mark Walker, deputy director of the economic division at The American Legion, May 21, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Kate Seif, assistant to the president for National Alliance to End Homelessness, May 21, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Andrew Fasoli, spokesman for U.S. Rep.
