He also did not answer PolitiFact\u2019s questions about a column Carson wrote in\u00a02014.", "We discovered the column after searching and failing to find a legitimate source of the statement. While Carson doesn\u2019t say in the column what this post attributes to him, there is similarity.", "\"Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked,\" wrote Carson, who went on to launch a 2016 bid for the Republican nomination for president. MSNBC, among others, pounced. \"Ben Carson: Strip citizenship from non-citizens who vote,\" the headline on the Nov. 13, 2014, story said before wondering about the logic behind Carson\u2019s idea. \"If these are non-citizens, as the context suggests, how can they have their citizenship revoked? If they\u2019re citizens, where are they being deported to?\"", "The MSNBC story cites a column WND.com published on Nov. 11, 2014: \"A common-sense prescription for immigration reform.\" When we visited the website on Feb. 5, the line was no longer in the column. However, it also appears in Carson\u2019s 2015 book, \"What I Believe: A Collection of My Syndicated Columns,\" under the title \"As Long as U.S. Leaders Game the System So Will Illegals.\"", "Let\u2019s look at the sentence in context. Carson said:", "\"As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: we must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rules of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society.\"", "No states run their elections exactly the same, but across the country, citizenship is a requirement to to vote in U.S. elections. Noncitizens, including permanent legal residents, cannot vote.
