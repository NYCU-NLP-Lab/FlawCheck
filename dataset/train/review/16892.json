["About this rating", "Jeffrey J. Rothschild, an American businessman now in his mid-sixties, is a successful engineer, entrepreneur, and former Facebook vice president whose net worth, according to Forbes, exceeds $3 billion.", "He is also, if online conspiracy theorists are to be believed, a thought leader in a CIA-backed New World Order plot to exterminate most of the world's population and enslave the survivors. In Internet memes making the rounds since 2013, Rothschild is quoted as saying a third world war will be required to accomplish these goals:", "Much as it may disappoint anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists, however, Forbes says that despite his great personal wealth Jeff Rothschild isn't related to the august banking family whose patriarch was Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) of Frankfurt, Germany. Jeff Rothschild's father, William B. Rothschild, inherited a rubber import business from his father, Marcus Rothschild, whose name appears nowhere in the Mayer Rothschild family tree.", "And although Jeff Rothschild did speak at a conference of Chinese and American entrepreneurs and investors in January 2013 (at which the above photo was taken), the event took place in Santa Clara, California (not China), and there is no record of him saying anything about a New World Order, a third world war, or a globalized feudal system. Nor have we been able to find such references in any other public statements uttered by Jeff Rothschild over the past two decades.", "This utter lack of evidence hasn't stopped anyone from promulgating these falsehoods, however. We ran across a similar quote shared by someone using the Twitter handle \"truther monkey\" in 2014:", "Jeff Rothschild gave this speech recently in China to some of the world's richest people ... please share .. pic.twitter.com/dPCqyyo8KT", "\u2014 truther monkey (@Thedyer1971) April 4, 2014", "Though their precise points of origin are uncertain, we traced both quotes to a 3 August 2013 post on a now-defunct \"underground anarchist\" blog called Anarchadia. Crucially, the anonymous author of the post cited no sources authenticating the statements.", "\"Where is the evidence he actually said these things?\" asked someone in the comments section of the page.", "\"Where is the evidence he didn't?\" was the response \u2014 a low evidentiary bar indeed.", "As is the case in so much conspiracist discourse, the very existence of the quotes, if real, would be self-contradictory anyway. By definition, the Illuminati conduct their business in absolute secrecy, yet we find them, time and time again (going all the way back to the fictitious 1903 Protocols of the Elders of Zion), allegedly revealing their entire subversive agenda in public.", "If that's as secretive they can be, we have nothing to fear from our supposed Illuminati overlords.", "Eaton, Kit. \u00a0\"The Facebook IPO Players Club: Jeff Rothschild.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Fast Company. \u00a03 February 2012.", "Hahn, Jason Duaine. \u00a0\"So, What Exactly Is the Illuminati Conspiracy?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Complex. \u00a020 February 2015.", "Mac, Ryan. \u00a0\"Meet New Billionaire Jeff Rothschild, the Engineer Who Saved Facebook from Crashing.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Forbes. \u00a028 February 2014.", "Rosenwald, Michael S. \u00a0\"The Rothschilds, a Pamphlet by 'Satan' and Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories Tied to a Battle 200 Years Ago.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The Washington Post. \u00a020 April 2018.", "Sales, Ben. \u00a0\"Nearly 200 Years of Anti-Semitic Conspiracies Continue to Cloud Rothschilds.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The Times of Israel. \u00a022 March 2018.", "Shasha, Han. \u00a0\"Facebook VP Talks at Summit on Startup Strategy.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0People's Daily Online. \u00a014 January 2013.", "Anarchadia. \u00a0\"Jeff Rothschild Helps the U.S. Military Censor Civilians.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a03 August 2013.", "Forbes.com. \u00a0\"Profile: Jeff Rothschild.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a018 May 2018.", "The New York Times. \u00a0\"Obituary: Marcus Rothschild, a Rubber Broker, 75.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a011 June 1962.", "The Rothschild Archive. \u00a0\"A to Z Listing of Rothschild Family Members.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Accessed 18 May 2018.", "Shift Frequency. \u00a0\"The Dark Agenda Behind Globalism and Open Borders.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a028 October 2016.", "United States Holocaust Museum. \u00a0\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Accessed 18 May 2018.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
