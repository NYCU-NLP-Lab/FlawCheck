["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on November 25, 2020", "A conservative group\u2019s deceptive TV ad suggests that Democrat Raphael Warnock supports defunding the police. He has said multiple times that he doesn\u2019t.", "The ad, from the American Crossroads super PAC, features Harris County, Georgia, Sheriff Mike Jolley accusing Warnock of being against police officers.", "\u201cWarnock is an anti-police extremist,\u201d Jolley says in the ad, which debuted Nov. 24. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s backed by defund the police radicals. Defunding the police is crazy. It\u2019s dangerous. While we\u2019re stopping real criminals, he\u2019s calling us thugs. Warnock cannot stand up to the radicals because he\u2019s one of them.\u201d", "But Warnock doesn\u2019t support efforts to defund law enforcement. He also didn\u2019t call all police officers \u201cthugs,\u201d as we wrote when fact-checking a similar attack from Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who Warnock hopes to unseat in one of Georgia\u2019s two upcoming runoff elections. In that case, he was addressing the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.", "This is actually the second ad American Crossroads has run this month linking Warnock to \u201cdefund the police radicals.\u201d But Warnock is not \u201cone of them,\u201d as the ad featuring Jolley could lead viewers to believe.", "Warnock for months has been saying he opposes defunding the police, the controversial concept of eliminating or reallocating funds from police budgets. Some individuals and groups began pushing to defund the police in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died while being detained by Minneapolis police officers in late May.", "When asked about his position in a June 25 Sirius XM radio interview (at the 13:30 mark), Warnock said: \u201cI do not believe that we should defund the police. I do believe that we should responsibly fund law enforcement. We need to reimagine policing and reimagine the relationships between law enforcement and communities. We certainly need to demilitarize the police, so that we can rebuild trust between the police and the community.\u201d", "Several weeks later, in an Aug. 20 WGAU radio interview (at the 6:25 mark), Warnock again said: \u201cNo we should not defund the police. We should certainly reimagine the relationship between the police and communities. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve fought for for years and I\u2019ll continue to fight for.\u201d", "After that, Warnock tweeted on Oct. 10: \u201cLet me be clear, I oppose defunding the police. But we have to respect law enforcement enough to hold them accountable.\u201d And during a Senate candidates\u2019 debate later that month, he reiterated that \u201cI do not think that we should defund the police.\u201d", "\u201cWhat we could use a senator doing is putting forward the kind of reform that we need in our criminal justice system. We need to get rid of qualified immunity [from civil lawsuits], we need an independent review process when civilians die at the hands of police. We can do that and at the same time appreciate the great work that our police officers do,\u201d he said.", "As for Jolley\u2019s claim that Warnock called police officers \u201cthugs and gangsters,\u201d that\u2019s a reference to a quote we\u2019ve written about before.", "In a 2015 sermon, Warnock, the senior pastor of Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, talked about police in Ferguson, Missouri \u2014 where Michael Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old Black man was shot and killed by a white officer in August 2014 \u2014 \u201cshowing up in a kind of gangster and thug mentality.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know you can wear all kinds of colors and be a thug. You can sometimes wear the colors of the state and behave like a thug.\u201d", "But Warnock wasn\u2019t talking about all law enforcement, his campaign told us.", "\u201cThis is very clearly in reference to a specific incident in Ferguson, Missouri and the behavior of some in the Michael Brown shooting, not at a comment on all police officers,\u201d the campaign clarified in an email.", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
