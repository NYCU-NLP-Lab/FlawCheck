["If there is one economic success that President Barack Obama likes to tout, it is the recovery of the American auto industry. An ad now circulating on the Web aims to strip Obama of that accomplishment. It is called Chinese Motors and accuses General Motors, and by extension, Obama, of parlaying American taxpayer dollars to create jobs in China.\n\nThe ad comes from Let Freedom Ring USA, a group that fuses religious and fiscal conservatives. The group\u2019s president Colin Hanna said he has spent $7 million dollars to have the ad show up 300 million times on computer screens in Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nHere is what the ad says:", "Obama video: \"We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.\"", "Image: \"Almost two-thirds of GM\u2019s jobs are in other countries - Forbes\"", "GM CEO video: \"Seven out of 10 of our vehicles were made outside the United States.\"", "Text: \"OUTSIDE the United States?\"", "Announcer: \"That\u2019s the CEO of General Motors, the man President Obama appointed.\"", "Image: \"GM, which closed 13 plants in the U.S. ... opened 15 plants in China. - CNN\"", "Tom Rose - retired auto worker: \"Is this a GM America bailout or a GM China bailout?\"", "GM CEO: \"Our commitment to work in China, with China, for China, remains strong.\"", "Announcer: \"President Obama. Your GM CEO is bragging about working for China? With our taxpayer dollars you gave him? Not working for us?\"", "Roy Smith - retired auto worker: \"Anytime our tax dollars are being used to prop up another country, it\u2019s not the right thing for America.\"", "Hanna has high hopes for what voters will take away from the ad. \"They will conclude that the GM bailout was a colossal misuse of their taxpayers\u2019 dollars,\" Hanna said. \"Not the shining example of betting on the American worker that President Obama claims that it is.\"\n\nIn this fact-check, we look at whether bailout money propped up GM\u2019s operations in China.\n\nSome key bankruptcy and bailout numbers\n\nThousands of American workers and lenders had a great deal riding on the restructuring of General Motors. When GM declared bankruptcy in 2009, it had $172 billion in debts and $82 billion in assets. Of its 50 largest creditors, 45 were suppliers like U.S. Steel and Goodyear Tires. Together, they were owed nearly $900 million. GM\u2019s obligations to its workers totaled $23 billion. Bondholders were owed $27 billion.\n\nSimply to stay afloat, GM borrowed over $9 billion from the government while President George W. Bush was in office. By the time it emerged from bankruptcy, the government had put about $51 billion into the effort to save GM. A bit over half of that has been repaid.", "GM in China and the U.S.\n\nIn China, GM has 11 joint ventures and two wholly owned foreign enterprises with more than 35,000 employees. In 2011, these firms produced 2.5 million vehicles and generated some $1.5 billion in profits for GM in the U.S.\n\nWith more and more Chinese interested in buying cars, GM plans to expand there. One of its joint ventures, Shanghai GM, recently won approval to build a $1 billion plant in the country\u2019s central Hubei province. The plant is slated to produce 300,000 vehicles a year.\n\nIn the United States, GM has 12 assembly plants, many other smaller plants and more than 79,000 employees. In 2011, those plants produced more than 1.8 million vehicles. The company\u2019s operating income across all its North American operations, which includes, Canada and Mexico, were $7.2 billion.\n\nSince 2009, GM says it has invested about $7.3 billion in its American facilities.\n\nFollowing the money\n\nThe ad claims that the bailout of GM propped up operations in China. To the extent that a collapse of GM in the United States would have caused considerable headaches in China, that claim is accurate. The end of GM would have required complex negotiations over the rights to use GM\u2019s designs and technology and a number of other knotty issues. Avoiding that was very good news for GM\u2019s Chinese partners.\n\nHowever, the ad has the financial relationship backwards. Those 2011 profits from China, about $1.3 billion, were something the firm had counted on for years.\n\n\"Even before the recession, GM was losing lots in America but making lots of money in China,\" said Kim Hill, an analyst with the Center for Automotive Research, a group that has many funders, including automakers. \"Sales in China were keeping the company afloat.\"\n\nAaron Bragman with IHS Automotive, a financial research group, underscored that China is one of GM\u2019s most profitable regions.\n\n\"They're the largest, most popular automaker in China, actually,\" Bragman said. \"The fact that seven out of 10 vehicles GM makes are not sold here but are actually sold abroad is a testament to the company's successful international business plans, not some crazy scheme to steal money from Americans to spend it elsewhere.\"\n\nWhen we asked Hanna for evidence to support the ad's message, he emphasized that the GM CEO, Dan Akerson, was caught on camera saying \"Our commitment to work .. for China remains strong.\"\n\n\"If the average voter knew that the president of GM who had been installed by the president,\" Hanna said, \"for a company that had been kept afloat by enormous infusion of taxpayer dollars, was bragging he was working for China, they would be shocked.\"\n\nGM spokesman Greg Martin, has two responses.\n\n\"Akerson was never appointed by the president,\" Martin said. Akerson put his name forward when the previous CEO, who had been appointed by the White House, said he wanted to step down. The GM board gave Akerson the job in August 2010.\n\nAs for Akerson\u2019s comments about working for China, Martin says that was a speech aimed at Chinese auto dealers and suppliers. It was a marketing pitch to assure them that GM thought they were important.\n\nWe watched the entire speech. The clip used in the ad was Akerson\u2019s summation, after he promised that GM would be a good corporate citizen, focused on sustainable development and ready to be part of the communities in which it operates.\n\n\"Our goal is to play a significant role in the social and economic changes that bring a better life to China\u2019s citizens,\" Akerson said.\n\n\"You could take any snippet of a speech and twist it anyway you want,\" Martin said. \"The context was, this was the sort of rousing speech you could find daily from an auto executive whether he was talking to suppliers in the U.S., members of a chamber of commerce, or state and local officials.\"\n\nOverseas production\n\nThe ad highlights that seven out of 10 GM vehicles are produced outside the United States. However, it fails to note that seven out of 10 GM vehicles are also sold outside the United States. GM officials says this is part of long-standing strategy to \"build where we sell.\"\n\nThe ad uses a peculiar device to suggest that GM China\u2019s gains come at the expense of American jobs. It cites a CNN article as saying \"GM, which closed 13 plants in the U.S. ... opened 15 plants in China.\"\n\nWe found the original article. The full sentence ended with, \"opened 15 plants in China in the last 10 years.\" The quote in the ad obscures that the time frames are entirely different. It blends decisions made years ago with those made more recently.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe ad claims that taxpayer dollars propped up GM\u2019s operations in China.\n\nWhile the collapse of GM would have presented the GM-China joint ventures with many problems, the bailout money itself didn\u2019t help China so much as allow GM to continue to draw money out of China. In fact, the Chinese operations were making money and supporting themselves through sales in China.\n\nThe ad makes several other errors of fact, including saying that the current GM CEO was appointed by Obama when he was not. Plus, the ad suggests that if GM says it is working for China, that must mean it is not working for the United States. It reinforces this idea by selectively quoting from a news article.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "Let Freedom Ring USA, Chinese Motors, October 15, 2012\n\nCNN, U.S. companies dump billions into China, January 20, 2011\n\nInterview with Colin Hanna, president of Let Freedom Ring USA, \u00a0October 16, 2012\n\nInterview with Greg Martin, executive director of communications, General Motors Company, October 16, 2012\n\nInterview with Kim Hill, analyst with Center for Automotive Research, October 15, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Aaron Bragman, analyst with IHS Automotive, October 15, 2012", "General Motors, Video: Akerson speech in China, February 2011\n\nWall Street Journal, Balancing the give and take in GM\u2019s Chinese partnership, August 19, 2012\n\nDetroit News, GM\u2019s Whitacre blocked plan to exit RenCen, October 13, 2012\n\nHuffington Post GM plant closure, June 1, 2012\n\nIHS Automotive, GM receives regulatory approval for 300,000-unit plan in Hubei Province, February 13, 2012\n\nCongressional Oversight Panel, An update on TARP support for the domestic automotive industry, January 13, 2011\n\nTreasury Department, Daily TARP update\n\nXinhua, General Motors to continue to investing aggressively in China, February 15, 2011\n\nGeneral Motors, 2011 annual report\n\nGeneral Motors, 2011 car and truck production, January, 1, 2012\n\nAuto Blog, GM reports 2011 profit of $7.6 billion, February 16, 2012\n\nSEC, General Motors 2010 Annual 10-K, April 7, 2010\n\nSEC, General Motors 2011 Annual 10-K, March 1, 2011\n\nNBC News, Humbled GM files for bankruptcy protection, June 1, 2009\n\nGeneral Motors, China operations\n\nThe New Republic, The new Norquist: Meet the GOP\u2019s latest hardline power broker, September 24, 2011\n\nGM Bankruptcy filing, June 1, 2009", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
