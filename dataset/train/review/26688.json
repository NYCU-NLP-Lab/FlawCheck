["By Robert Farley", "Posted on November 5, 2019", "A number of national polls show more Americans want President Donald Trump impeached and removed from office than those who don\u2019t. In swing states, however, a majority opposes removing Trump from office via impeachment, even as a majority supports moving forward with the impeachment inquiry.", "Those are the polling statistics that Trump twisted over the weekend when he accused the media of \u201creading the wrong polls\u201d and said that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want anything to do with impeachment.\u201d", "In remarks to the press on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3, Trump tried to keep the focus not on national polling, but more narrowly on only polls in swing states.", "Trump, Nov. 2: If you look at what\u2019s happening, if you look at the poll numbers, if you look at the poll numbers in the swing states, they\u2019re saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d", "Trump, Nov. 3: The impeachment polls have been very, very strong \u2014 and especially in the swing states, I think you see that.\u00a0 The swing states \u2014 they don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u00a0 And we have polls \u2014 people don\u2019t want to hear about impeachment. The only one that wants impeachment \u2014 to talk about it \u2014 is the fake media and the Democrats, who \u2014 basically, they work for the media", "When Trump says the public polled in swing states is saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d that depends on if \u201cit\u201d means moving forward with the impeachment inquiry, or impeaching and removing Trump from office.", "According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Oct. 30, majorities in six battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 oppose impeaching and removing Trump (52%-44%). (The battleground poll has a margin of error of 1.7 percentage points.) A Trump campaign official seized on those findings, telling The Hill that while large percentages in Democratic states like New York and California support impeachment, \u201cin these states where the election is really going to be fought, we\u2019re seeing that voters oppose impeachment, and there\u2019s an intensity to that opposition.\u201d", "William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote about the divergence between national and swing-state opinion, noting, \u201cAs we know, presidential elections are made in the electoral college on a state-by-state basis \u2026 which is why it is important to look at public opinion by state.\u201d", "Notably, though, that same poll shows that while a majority does not support removing Trump via impeachment, about the same percentage, 51%, supports the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House (44% oppose it). That contradicts Trump\u2019s claim that most \u201cdon\u2019t want to hear about it\u201d and don\u2019t want to \u201ctalk about it.\u201d", "Democrats have acknowledged that public sentiment is a key part of the impeachment process.", "\u201cPublic opinion is everything,\u201d Rep. Terri Sewell said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Nov. 3. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi often quotes Thomas Jefferson, that it\u2019s all about public sentiment. So having said that, I think it\u2019s really important that we present in a deliberate fashion.\u201d", "Nationally, public sentiment is more pro-impeachment than it is in just swing states. According to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, a plurality of voters, 48.1%, support impeachment and removing Trump, while 44.9% do not. That\u2019s an average of many polls, including recent polls from NBC News/Wall Street Journal, ABC News/Washington Post, Fox News, Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, USA Today/Suffolk, Grinnell College/Selzer, Quinnipiac and CNN.", "A slightly larger percentage, 50.9%, supports the House moving forward with an impeachment inquiry (42.3% oppose).", "The FiveThirtyEight impeachment poll tracker reports similar results: 50.4% support beginning the impeachment process, while 41.2% do not; and 48.1% say Trump should be impeached or impeached and removed, while 44.6% don\u2019t support that.", "Those national polling figures got lost in comments Trump made to reporters on Nov. 3, when a reporter asked \u2014 correctly \u2014 about the fact that \u201caccording to several recent polls, more Americans want you to be impeached and removed from office than the number of Americans who don\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cWell, you\u2019re reading the wrong polls,\u201d Trump responded.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re reading the wrong polls.\u201d", "The reporter, again rightly, noted that included polls conducted by Fox News, the NBC/Wall Street Journal and ABC/Washington Post.", "\u201cLet me just tell you, I have the real polls,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster. But the real polls \u2014 if you look at polls that came out this morning \u2014 people don\u2019t want anything to do with impeachment.\u201d", "We reached out to the White House to find out what polls Trump was referring to, and whether that was from internal polling, but we did not receive a response. Perhaps the Trump reelection campaign has internal polls that show something different. But the majority of national public polls do not support Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want anything to do with impeachment.\u201d", "On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn was asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comment to the Washington Post back in March. \u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,\u201d Pelosi said.", "CNN\u2019s Dana Bash noted that the House this week passed a resolution to approve procedures on impeachment, but got not a single Republican vote.", "Clyburn said \u201cwhen we talk about bipartisan support, we are not limiting that to the Congress. I have been watching the polls all over the country. There is rising support within Republican voters in favor of moving forward. Independents seem to be \u2014 a majority of them seem to be in favor of moving forward, and certainly overwhelmingly Democrats.\u201d", "According to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, just 12% of Republicans support the impeachment inquiry, while 83.2% oppose it. Among independents, 46.8% support an impeachment inquiry, while 38% oppose it. So, a plurality of independents support it, but not a \u201cmajority,\u201d as Clyburn said. Among Democrats, 84.8% support an impeachment inquiry, and 8.8% oppose it.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
