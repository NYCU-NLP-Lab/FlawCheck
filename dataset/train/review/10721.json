His trial continues to drag on while he and his lawyers play games. Rahim Hussein al-Nashiri, another of the planners, is still awaiting trial. But Mashur Abdallah Ahmed al Sabri, one of the members of the USS Cole cell, has already been released by Barack Obama from Guantanamo Bay.", "Sabri was rated as a high risk terrorist who is \u201dis likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests, and allies\u201d, but that was no obstacle for Obama who had already fired one Secretary of Defense for being slow to free dangerous Al Qaeda terrorists and was browbeating his latest appointee over the same issue.", "The very paperwork that was used as the basis for the decision to free Sabri describes him as \u201ca member of a Yemeni al-Qaida cell directly involved with the USS Cole attack\u201d. This cell \u201cconducted surveillance\u201d on the targeted vessel and \u201cprepared explosives for the bombing\u201d. Sabri had been arrested in Yemen for his involvement in the attack before he managed to make his way to Afghanistan.", "Al-Sabri was one of several Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners transferred to Saudi Arabia\u00a0in a widely reported April 2016 negotiated deal with the country.\u00a0A 16 April 2016 article\u00a0did not specifically describe al-Sabri as linked to\u00a0the USS Cole attack:", "US officials on Saturday described the nine [transferred] detainees, all Yemenis, as possessing close family ties to Saudi Arabia. Some, one official said, are \u201cpractically Saudis\u201d.", "The transfer puts the residual Guant\u00e1namo detainee population at 80, the lowest it has been in its 14-year history.", "The transfer also clears another statistical milestone for the administration. There are now more detainees approved to leave Guant\u00e1namo, 26, than there are so-called \u201cforever detainees\u201d, the term lawyers use to describe those whom the administration has insufficient evidence to charge but claims are too dangerous to release.", "One of the detainees, Mashur Abdullah Muqbil Ahmed al-Sabri, was cleared for transfer by the administration\u2019s quasi-parole board for Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees in April 2015. The other eight were cleared in 2010 by a multi-agency review early in the Obama administration.", "Aside from al-Sabri and Ba Odah, the other men released on Saturday to Saudi Arabia are Ahmed Umar Abdullah al-Hikimi, Abdul Rahman Mohammed Saleh Nasir, Ali Yahya Mahdi al-Raimi, Muhammed Abdullah Muhammed al-Hamiri, Ahmed Yaslam Said Kuman, Abd al Rahman al-Qyati, and Mansour Muhammed Ali al-Qatta.", "Before his\u00a0transfer\u00a0in mid-April 2016, little was written about al-Sabri or the reasons for which he was\u00a0detained in the controversial prison. A Google search restricted to on or before 1 February 2016 yielded just three hits -- all of which were misdated items concerning his transfer to Saudi Arabia. If al-Sabri was a major name linked with the USS Cole investigation, that was not reported between the October 2000 attack and his April 2016 transfer out of Guantanamo Bay.", "Other (and more credible) reporting did not link\u00a0al-Sabri to the USS Cole bombing:", "The Defense Department expressed gratitude to the kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] in a statement on Saturday.", "\"The United States is grateful to the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility,\" the statement said.", "The Department of Defense identified the men as Ahmed Umar Abdullah Al-Hikimi, Abdul Rahman Mohammed Saleh Nasir, Ali Yahya Mahdi Al-Raimi, Tariq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Ba Odah, Muhammed Abdullah Muhammed Al-Hamiri, Ahmed Yaslam Said Kuman, Abd al Rahman Al-Qyati, Mansour Muhammed Ali Al-Qatta and Mashur Abdullah Muqbil Ahmed Al-Sabri.", "Al-Sabri was not among the most notable\u00a0or notorious prisoners transferred to Saudi Arabia in April 2016. Extensive information about him\u00a0was available via a New York Times project called\u00a0\"The Guant\u00e1namo Docket,\" which includes detailed files on each detainee.

Detainee was a member of a Yemeni al-Qaida cell directly involved with the USS COLE attack. Members of this cell conducted surveillance on the USS COLE and prepared explosives for the bombing. Detainee was recruited and facilitated through the al-Qaida network and traveled to Afghanistan (AF), where he received advanced training at al-Qaida facilities. Detainee is assessed to have served as a guesthouse facilitator (a position of trust and authority), associated with senior al-Qaida members, and probably swore bayat (oath of allegiance) to Usama Bin Laden (UBL). Detainee participated in combat in Afghanistan.

Detainee continues to downplay his significance and affiliations with other alQaida members. Detainee denies ever attending a terrorist training camp, but his name is included on applications for terrorist training. Although detainee has provided unique information about his associates who were linked to the USS COLE attack, he denies any involvement, contrary to reporting from other sources. He sometimes has claimed he was born in Taiz, YM and other times in Mecca, SA, demonstrating his willingness to mislead US intelligence officials on even the most basic detail.", "While closing\u00a0the\u00a0Guant\u00e1namo Bay\u00a0detention camp was an initial and ongoing aim of the Obama administration, President Obama was not directly involved with the details of prisoner transfers.

American officials have been reluctant to repatriate them because Yemen is chaotic and has an active affiliate of Al Qaeda.", "But Saudi Arabia, which shares a border with Yemen, has a stronger government and security. It also operates a rehabilitation program for Saudis who have drifted into militant Islamism. The program tries to reverse their radicalization and help them reintegrate into peaceful society. It enlists their relatives to help and has a record of reducing \u2014 though not eliminating \u2014 the risk of recidivism, officials have said ... When Mr. Obama became president in 2009 and vowed to close the prison at the Guant\u00e1namo military base in Cuba, there were 242 detainees, 99 of them Yemenis. In separate trips to Saudi Arabia that spring, John O. Brennan, then Mr. Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, and Robert M. Gates, who was the defense secretary, again raised the idea, according to another leaked cable and news reports. They were again rebuffed.", "Later in October [2-16], [Secretary of State John] Kerry visited Saudi Arabia again, but was told only that the Interior Ministry was still looking at the [prisoner transfer] request, officials said. But a positive sign came from Brian Neff, a lawyer for one of the Yemeni men, Mashur al Sabri.", "After a parolelike board approved Mr. Sabri\u2019s transfer last April, Mr. Neff drafted a petition for his family to send to the Saudi government, asking it to take Mr. Sabri. In October, his relatives told Mr. Neff that Saudi officials had visited them to study whether that plan would work.", "Finally, a separate Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoner was identified as the \"mastermind\" of the attack in a 2011 article.

It is\u00a0possible that FrontPage Mag\u00a0confused the newly-transferred al-Sabri with an individual with a\u00a0similar\u00a0name, but that person\u00a0was not described as a current or former detainee.

President Obama did not have any hand in the transfer of al-Sabri or any other specific prisoner, as that task remains\u00a0the responsibility of the PRB. While al-Sabri's file mentioned a potential link to groups involved in the USS Cole attack, his\u00a0own involvement was tenuous to nonexistent.
