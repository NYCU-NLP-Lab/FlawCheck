["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on April 14, 2017", "Sen. Bill Cassidy of\u00a0Louisiana said William Wilberforce, a late 18th century British\u00a0politician, \u201cpushed the sale of beer\u201d to successfully combat \u201cdrunkenness related to gin\u201d in\u00a0England.\u00a0But Wilberforce wasn\u2019t even born until after the so-called gin epidemic had ended in the early 1750s, and its\u00a0conclusion\u00a0wasn\u2019t due to beer.", "The gin epidemic\u2019s end eventually came at the hand of multiple factors, including the rising\u00a0price of grain, reduced\u00a0wages\u00a0and legislation that raised taxes on\u00a0gin. Beer consumption also remained stagnant during the 18th century, which experts say\u00a0suggests people were drinking gin, or cheap spirits generally, in addition to beer, not substituting one for the other.", "Cassidy, also a\u00a0doctor,\u00a0made his claims on April 5 during the confirmation hearing of Scott Gottlieb, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration.", "Cassidy, April 5: One of my favorite historical figures is William Wilberforce. Many reasons why, but among them is that he realized that there\u2019s a lot of problems with drunkenness related to gin. And so the way he mitigated that was he pushed the sale of beer. And the idea is that you\u2019d get so bloated, you\u2019d have to urinate, etc., etc., that you could only drink so much beer as opposed to drinking a lot of gin. It went really successful [sic].", "Cassidy then compared what he believed to be the solution to gin drinking in England to tobacco use today. He said \u201cmaybe the way to address tobacco is by tobacco mitigation,\u201d namely by \u201clooking for products that would be an alternative to a cigarette\u201d with \u201cless of the untoward effects.\u201d Later on during the hearing, Cassidy\u00a0doubled-down on his claims about gin and beer\u00a0during an exchange with Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota.", "Franken, April 5: I\u2019m struck by the gin for beer, because I would just like to throw it open to anybody here \u2014 I think that doesn\u2019t actually work.", "Cassidy: It worked in England. That was actually seen as a milestone, I don\u2019t want to use your time, but as a milestone in the cessation of alcoholism.", "Franken: I\u2019m skeptical.", "Franken has good reason\u00a0to be skeptical. There was a William at the time who depicted beer drinking as being preferrable to\u00a0gin drinking during the\u00a0gin epidemic \u2014 Cassidy may have been referring to that. But, if so, Cassidy\u00a0had the wrong William, and, regardless, beer consumption didn\u2019t end the gin epidemic.", "We reached out to Cassidy\u2019s office for support multiple times, but we haven\u2019t received a response. If we do, we\u2019ll update this piece accordingly.", "What caused the epidemic to begin with? According to historians, a proliferation in the domestic production of spirits played a large role.", "In the 16th century, gin and other spirits were rarely\u00a0consumed\u00a0in England. Most distilling occurred only for medicinal purposes, according to\u00a0Peter Clark, a historian at the University of Helsinki in Finland. But by\u00a0the\u00a01680s, the consumption of spirits had spread across the southern portion of the country, though most supplies came from abroad, primarily France, explains Clark in a paper published in\u00a0Transactions of the Royal Historical Society in April 1987.", "In the late 1680s, when\u00a0England went to war with France, the English Parliament passed a series\u00a0of laws that protected domestic distilleries from foreign\u00a0imports. For example, England\u00a0imposed duties on imported spirits and abolished the monopoly that the\u00a0London Company of Distillers had on the domestic production of spirits. This led to a\u00a0proliferation of distillers in the country. By the 1730s, London alone was said to have 1,500 distilleries, says Clark.", "With more distilleries, gin and other spirits became affordable and accessible to \u201cworking-class consumers,\u201d explains historian\u00a0Jessica Warner\u00a0and co-authors in a paper\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health in March 2001. In an email, Warner, who wrote a book on the gin epidemic,\u00a0also explained that \u201c\u2018gin\u2019 was an umbrella term for cheap, domestically produced spirits\u201d; hence the historical label, \u201cgin epidemic\u201d or \u201cgin craze.\u201d", "According to Warner and colleagues, \u201cOnce established, the domestic distillery very quickly emerged as an important source of revenue to the Crown.\u201d This led to increasing taxation on gin and other spirits between 1710 and 1762. At the same time, \u201cOnly gradually did the state concern itself with the threat, probably more imagined than real, that gin posed to maintaining public order,\u201d particularly in London, which was England\u2019s largest market for distilled spirits, the group adds. With this concern, regulating\u00a0gin also became\u00a0a way of combating what was seen as an epidemic.", "In fact, it\u2019s unclear how much of a problem the so-called epidemic posed, but Warner and her colleagues write, \u201cattempts to restrict the consumption of distilled spirits were rooted in an essentially hierarchical vision of the social order.\u201d These attempts \u201creflected the belief that the excesses of the working poor posed a particular threat to the nation, threatening to deprive it of both workers and soldiers.\u201d", "Warner and colleagues date the so-called epidemic as peaking\u00a0between roughly\u00a01720 and 1751.\u00a0During this time, the British Parliament passed a number of\u00a0\u201cGin Acts\u201d that raised taxes on distilled spirits, while also aiming to \u201climit the number\u201d of outlets\u00a0\u201clicensed to sell them,\u201d the group writes.", "From 1700 to 1729, the consumption of British spirits grew by 260 percent, from 0.36 gallons per person\u00a0(15 years or older) per year to 1.31 gallons. A\u00a0peak in consumption in 1729 paralleled the first of the gin acts, which Warner and colleagues argue led to a 24 percent drop in consumption the following year.", "However, consumption grew again, reaching a peak of 1.74 gallons in 1735. The Parliament then passed another act in 1736, which led to a 30 percent drop in consumption over the next year. Yet by 1743, consumption had again grown, reaching a peak of 2.21 gallons per person per year.", "Consumption then dropped from 1.83 gallons in 1744 to 0.59 gallons in 1771. Another gin act was also passed in 1751, which Warner and colleagues argue finally \u201csucceeded\u201d in controlling\u00a0the gin epidemic, but \u201cby accident rather than by design,\u201d as we\u2019ll explain.", "At the height of consumption, the 2.21 gallons per person per year would be less than an ounce of gin (or other spirits) per person per day. It would be the equivalent of drinking about one gin and tonic (with 1.5 ounces of gin) every other day.", "For comparison,\u00a0U.S. consumption\u00a0between 2008 and 2010\u00a0was about 2 gallons of spirits (80 proof) per person (15 years or\u00a0older) per year on average, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 also under an ounce per day.\u00a0However, Warner told us that spirits\u00a0were likely\u00a0often\u00a0diluted during the epidemic, so comparisons to today might not be\u00a0valid.", "Overall, Warner and her colleagues\u00a0argue legislation had mainly\u00a0short-term effects on combating the so-called epidemic, that is, only in the first year after the passage of each act.", "But what finally did in the epidemic?", "Around the time of the passage of the 1751 act, \u201cthe government started to gain the upper hand,\u201d write Warner and colleagues. Based on their analysis, \u201cthe effects of increased taxation may have been magnified by a gradual decline in real wages,\u201d they write. Hence, this gin act may have \u201csucceeded\u201d because of other changes occurring in the country at the time.", "Warner elaborated on this point in an email. She said, \u201c[T]he English population is pretty much stagnant in the first half of the eighteenth century, meaning that it had the disposable income to spend on more alcohol.\u201d But in the second half of the century, the population grew rapidly, which means \u201cthat working people had less money to spend on luxuries such as alcohol.\u201d", "In other words, rapid population growth can drive down real wages. The idea is\u00a0that if more people are available for work, then employers can pay each person they do hire less, she explained.", "But there was another stressor at play \u2014 the rising cost of grain.", "The price of grain went up for two reasons, Warner told us. First, \u201cdemand rose with the population,\u201d and second, \u201cthe generally good harvests of the first half of the century were followed by the generally poor harvests of the second half,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, gin is made from grain, so that\u2019s one factor in pricing it out of the reach of more people,\u201d but \u201cwith food being the principal expenditure for most families, any increase in the price of bread had to be met by belt-tightening elsewhere,\u201d she added.", "In a nutshell, \u201cLower wages + higher food costs = less money to spend on alcohol,\u201d Warner said.", "Warner and colleagues also say that the government\u2019s \u201cinterventions to limit consumption did not succeed\u201d until there was \u201csome level of public consensus\u201d on gin\u2019s negative effects. They point out that a lack of public consensus might help account for the failure of early legislation\u00a0to regulate gin.", "Warner et al, March 2001: Consensus\u2014or rather its absence\u2014also helps account for the conspicuous failure of the gin acts of 1729 and 1736. These were the most draconian of the acts, and in both instances consumption declined only momentarily, reflecting a brief flurry of activity on the part of the magistrates responsible for enforcing the acts. Within a year or so, consumption rebounded, rising to new heights shortly thereafter. Then, upon repeal, consumption actually dropped. This pattern makes sense, in part, if we again shift the focus of the argument and concede that what was being regulated was not so much a commodity as a moral behavior rooted in the values and daily routines of the larger community.", "So, did beer, as Cassidy said, play any part in ending the gin epidemic?", "The trends in consumption don\u2019t suggest it. While the consumption of spirits increased, beer drinking\u00a0during the 18th century generally remained static, say Warner and colleagues, at roughly 30 gallons per person per year.\u00a0That\u2019s about 10.5 ounces of beer a day.", "In other words, there\u2019s no evidence to support Cassidy\u2019s claim that promoting beer to combat gin drinking led to \u201ca milestone in the cessation of alcoholism.\u201d And that certainly wasn\u2019t done by William Wilberforce, who was born in 1759, after\u00a0the gin epidemic had ended.", "(For comparison,\u00a0U.S. consumption\u00a0between 2008 and 2010\u00a0was about 8.5 ounces of beer per person per day on average, according to the WHO data. Warner also told us that the strength of beer in the 18th century was roughly comparable to beer today.)", "However, James Nicholls, a historian at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, did say by email that Cassidy may be confusing William Wilberforce with William Hogarth.", "\u201cThe Senator may be thinking about the regulation of the gin trade around 1751, which was in part motivated by William\u00a0Hogarth\u2019s famous prints Gin Lane and Beer Street, which certainly did suggest beer was the healthy alternative to gin,\u201d Nicholls said.", "According to the BBC, Hogarth\u2019s prints were part of a campaign to curb gin drinking around this time, a campaign which resulted in the 1751 gin act.\u00a0\u201cHowever, the 1751 Gin Act really only amplified a reduction in gin drinking that had started in the mid-1740s \u2013 though it was seen at the time as effectively bringing an end to the \u2018Gin Craze,'\u201d added Nicholls.", "Wilberforce, on the other hand, \u201cwas a founding member of the \u2018Proclamation Society\u2018 in 1787, which campaigned against vice generally, and did call for better regulation of public houses,\u201d or pubs, added Nicholls. \u201cBut by then gin was not the political issue it had been 50 years earlier.\u201d", "To top it off, Dan Malleck, a historian at Brock University in Canada, told us by email that another premise of Cassidy\u2019s claim is off. Cassidy said Wilberforce pushed the sale of beer over gin because \u201cthe idea is that you\u2019d get so bloated\u201d when drinking beer, compared with drinking gin, thereby tempering alcohol consumption. But \u201cbeer wasn\u2019t heavily carbonated in the 18th century,\u201d Malleck said, which means that it likely wouldn\u2019t cause as much bloating as\u00a0beer does today.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
