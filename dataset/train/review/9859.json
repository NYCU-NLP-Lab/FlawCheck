According to this particular meme, Trump told Donahue at the time that his \"high IQ\" made it \"impossible\" for him not to be an atheist:", "We found no evidence that Trump uttered this phrase, and no evidence that he even appeared on\u00a0The Phil Donahue Show\u00a0in 1989. The media mogul was a guest\u00a0on the show in 1987,\u00a0but there is no record of him discussing his religious views (or, more accurately, his lack thereof) during that appearance.", "This photo wasn't taken during an episode of\u00a0The Phil Donahue Show, either. It\u00a0was\u00a0taken during an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show in 1988:", "This is just one of the many fake quotes currently being falsely attributed to the Republican presidential candidate. \u00a0(Lest any other presidential candidates feel left out, there are plenty of fake quotes about them circulating around the internet as well.)", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
