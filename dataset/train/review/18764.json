Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material.

(Famously, the \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski was subjected to brutal psychological experimentation, suspected to have been part of an MKUltra sub-project, while he was a promising mathematics student at Harvard in the late 1950s.)", "In January 1973, CIA Technical Services Director Sidney Gottlieb -- the infamous poisons expert who oversaw the MKUltra program -- destroyed many documents relating to the substance of the experiments  upon the order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, the U.S Senate would later hear.

Baker Hostetler is located in the same building where the CIA operates three companies called Red Coats Inc., Admiral Security Services, and Datawatch. They are operated by Ralph Blasey II.

Rather, in 2017 Fusion GPS told the Washington Post that they had performed some work as a subcontractor for Baker Hostetler, who were representing a Russian holding company in a money laundering case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. (More information about Fusion GPS' place in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections can be viewed here.)", "However, Fusion GPS told the Post that their work for Baker Hostetler began in 2013, while Ralph Blasey III stopped working for the law firm in 2004, nine years before they engaged Fusion GPS.", "Baker Hostetler's Washington, D.C. address is 1050 Connecticut Avenue Northwest. None of the three companies listed in the conspiracy theory as CIA fronts run by Ralph Blasey Jr. (Christine's father) has offices at that address. Ralph Blasey Jr. is listed as Vice President for Business Development of one of them, Red Coats, Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland-based cleaning company.", "Admiral Security Services (which provides security guard and concierge services) is a division of Red Coats, and Datawatch Systems is owned and operated by the same people but located at a different address (albeit within walking distance in Bethesda.)", "Ralph Blasey Jr. works for only one of those three companies, none of which shares an address with Baker Hostetler (the law firm which Ralph Blasey III, in any case, left in 2004) or has been shown by any evidence whatsoever to be \"operated\" by the CIA.", "Like many other companies in the Washington, D.C. area, Datawatch Systems, which provides doorway and access security services, does have contracts with several federal government departments and agencies, as does Red Coats, Inc., and Admiral Security Services. However, none of them has a contract with the CIA.", "This attempt to link Christine Blasey Ford to the CIA through her brother Ralph therefore fails on several fronts.", "Nick Deak", "Before we get to the substance of this part of the conspiracy theory, it's worth pointing out the profound logical flaw at the heart of it. The underlying premise here is that, if Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather was an intelligence agent, she herself must therefore be steeped in spycraft and have the same interests, temperament, and profession as her grandfather. Anyone with a different personality or career to that of their grandfather will instinctively recognize this assumption as nonsensical.", "In any event, the claim here is that Blasey Ford's grandfather was the legendary CIA-linked currency trader Nicholas \"Nick\" Deak. Without offering any evidence of a familial relationship, the BrassBalls blog stated that \"Christine and Ralph III\u2019s grandfather was Nicholas Deak. Former CIA Director William Casey acknowledged Deak\u2019s decades of service to the CIA.\"", "Deak has been the subject of speculation and fascination for decades. In 1964, Time magazine called him \"the James Bond of the world of money,\" writing:", "Born in Hungary 58 years ago, Deak holds a doctorate in economics, can talk money in five languages, used to work for the League of Nations. A naturalized American, he spent World War II as an [Office of Strategic Services] agent parachuting into Burmese jungles to search for Japanese prisoners. On a postwar assignment, he sneaked Hungarian boxcars past the Russian occupiers to help rebuild West Germany's railways. Deak still keeps in OSS trim with a vegetarian diet, daily sprints around his own suburban running track, and ski trips with his Viennese wife. From a paneled office (cable address: Deaknick) overlooking lower Manhattan harbor, he supervises more than 100 agents working for Deak & Co., one of the world's biggest dealers in foreign currencies.", "In 1985, Deak was shot dead (along with his receptionist Frances Lauder) at his office in Lower Manhattan by Lois Lang, a homeless woman with a history of mental illness. Because of Deak's life-long connections to the CIA and a recent scandal which had implicated his firm in money laundering on behalf of international crime organizations, theories have been put forth that Lang was not merely motivated by her own delusions, as investigators concluded, but was acting under the direction of nefarious and organized forces, criminal or governmental.", "In 2012, Arkadi Kuhlmann, who replaced Deak as CEO of his firm, told Salon of his own skepticism about the official account of his predecessor's murder:", "\u201cI never believed that the whole thing was random,\u201d said Kuhlmann, in an interview with Salon. Ditto the government inquiry that triggered the collapse preceding Lang\u2019s rampage. \u201cWe were the CIA\u2019s paymaster, and that got to be a little bit embarrassing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur time had passed and the usefulness of doing things our way had vanished. The world was changing in the '80s; you couldn\u2019t just accept bags of cash. Deak was slow at making those changes. And when you lose your sponsorship, you\u2019re out of the game.\u201d", "Whatever the truth about the death of Nicholas Deak, one thing is clear: he was not Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather. Multiple news articles before and after his death stipulated that he had only one child, a son named Robert Leslie, also known as \"Les.\"", "This information obviously rules out the possibility that Deak was Blasey Ford's maternal grandfather, and since we know her father is Ralph Blasey Jr., we can say with certainty that Deak was not her paternal grandfather either. This eliminates the third and final component of the conspiracy theory, as articulated by Michael Savage and others.", "Interestingly, the WhatDoesItMean.com does not claim that Deak was Blasey Ford's grandfather, but rather connects the two by way of another figure from a bygone era, Dr. Frederick Melges:", "Though the American people were correctly told that Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care, this report continues, what was failed to be reported to them was that Lang had been under the direct care and medical supervision of the CIA\u2019s own Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to New York City to carry out this assassination\u2014and who was the exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his CIA-funded mind control MKULTRA programme\u2014and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this past December, imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent\u2014but that does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey, who remains able to teach her CIA Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford University the MKULTRA mind control techniques discovered by Dr. Melges.", "The claims that Lang had been treated by Dr. Melges, and that Melges was associated with the MKUltra project, was written about in Salon's 2012 account of Deak's death:", "In August 1975, records show that Lang was discovered naked and catatonic in a Santa Clara motel room ... Police responding to the motel room took Lang to nearby Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. For the next month, she was put under the care of Dr. Frederick Melges, a psychiatrist associated with the Stanford Research Institute. One of Dr. Melges\u2019 main areas of research: drug-aided hypnosis. A few years after Lang was put in Melges\u2019 care, the New York Times exposed the Stanford Research Institute as a center for CIA research into \u201cbrain-washing\u201d and \u201cmind-control\u201d experiments in which unwitting subjects were dosed with hallucinogenic drugs and subjected to hypnosis ...", "The Stanford Research Institute received CIA funding, and Dr. Melges published work about using drugs and hypnosis to create \u201cdisassociative states,\u201d i.e., induced schizophrenia. One of Melges\u2019 partners on these experiments was a doctor named Leo E. Hollister, who first dosed Ken Kesey with LSD as part of an Army experiment in 1960. He later admitted to author John Marks that he conducted drug research for the CIA ...", "In other words, the doctor who cared for Lang in Santa Clara was a senior figure at one of the CIA\u2019s top institutional grantees. He worked side-by-side with a self-identified CIA collaborator, and conducted research into the kind of drug-induced behavior modification that the agency is known to have funded.", "We were unable to verify the claim that Dr. Melges took Lang into his care in 1975, or what that treatment might have entailed. Frederick Towne Melges (known as \"Rusty\") was a psychiatrist from Battle Creek, Michigan, who received his medical degree from Columbia University before working at the University of Rochester and Duke University in later years.", "In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Melges worked at Stanford University, researching the perception of time. He conducted studies into the effects of cannabis and alcohol on time perception, personal perceptions of the future, persecutory delusion among people with acute mental illness, and several subjects related to human emotion. Some of his research involved administering doses of THC (the hallucinatory component in cannabis) as well as alcohol.", "We were not able to verify the claim that Melges worked at the Stanford Research Institute, and it is unclear whether he ever took part in any MKUltra-related experimentation. However, even if one accepts for the sake of argument the claims made by WhatDoesItMean.com and Salon, no meaningful link exists between Dr. Melges and Christine Blasey Ford.", "Melges, who suffered from diabetes, died at the age of 52 in Durham, North Carolina, in July 1988, having worked at Duke University since 1977. Blasey Ford got her undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1988, then received a master's in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University in 1991, a PhD in educational psychology from the University of Southern California in 1996, and a master's in epidemiology from Stanford University in 2009.", "She and Melges never attended or worked at the same university contemporaneously. The earliest record we could find of Blasey Ford's working at Stanford was in the year 2000, by which time Melges had been dead for 12 years (and had left Stanford more than a decade before that).", "Even if Melges were associated with the MKUltra program, the fact of Christine Blasey Ford's attendance and employment at Stanford several decades later does not even come close to establishing a link between the two.", "Savage, Michael. \u00a0 \"Is Dr. Ford Deeply Tied to CIA?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 MichaelSavage.com. \u00a0 27 September 2018.", "BrassBalls.blog. \u00a0 \"Dr. Christine Blasey Heads Stanford's CIA Undergraduate Internship Program.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 22 September 2018.", "ZeroHedge. \u00a0 \"CIA Honeytrap Set -- Kavanaugh Accuser CIA Ties.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 23 September 2018.", "BeforeItsNews.com. \u00a0 \"Kavanaugh Accuser Family CIA Black Budget Ops/Fusion GPS/Deep State Security Ties.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 BeforeItsNews.com. \u00a0 17 September 2018.", "Faal, Sorcha. \u00a0 \"Daughter of CIA Assassin Paymaster Tries to Bring Down Trump Supreme Court Nominee Kavanaugh.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 WhatDoesItMean.com. \u00a0 17 September 2018.", "U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Committee on Human Resources. \u00a0 \"Joint Hearing -- Project MKUltra, the CIA's Program of Research in Behavioral Modification.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 3 August 1977.", "Rogin, Josh. \u00a0 \"Inside the Link Between the Russian Lawyer Who Met Donald Trump Jr. and the Trump Dossier.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 11 July 2017.", "TIME. \u00a0 \"Money: The World of Deaknick.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Time. \u00a0 12 June 1964.", "Hornblower, Margot. \u00a0 \"Deak-Perrera Chairman Fatally Shot in Office.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 19 November 1985.", "Kristof, Nicholas D. \u00a0 \"Collapse of Deak & Company.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 10 December 1984.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Accused Killer Called Schizophrenic.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Billings Gazette. \u00a0 22 November 1985.", "Ames, Mark and Alexander Zaitchik. \u00a0 \"James Bond and the Killer Bag Lady.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Salon. \u00a0 2 December 2012.", "Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Nicholas Deak, 80; Was Trader of Foreign Currencies, Agent.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The South Florida Sun Sentinel. \u00a0 19 November 1985.", "August, Betsy. \u00a0 \"Slain Currency Dealer Deak Eulogized in Manhattan.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The [White Plains] Journal News. \u00a0 22 November 1985.", "Dean, Jim. \u00a0 \"Takes New Post.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Battle Creek Enquirer. \u00a0 26 September 1984.", "Smith, Delos. \u00a0 \"Tests Show Marijuana Distorts Sense of Time.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 United Press International. \u00a0 25 June 1971.", "The Battle Creek Enquirer. \u00a0 \"Frederick T.
