["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on June 23, 2020", "Social media accounts supportive of President Donald Trump have been sharing a photo of a large outdoor crowd with the false claim that it shows the scene outside of Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally. It actually shows the Rolling Thunder event near Washington, D.C. in 2019.", "Although President Donald Trump had expected to fill the 19,000-seat arena for his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma \u2014 with overflow crowds next door \u2014 there were whole sections\u00a0of empty seats at the June 20 event.", "The Tulsa Fire Department reported that about 6,200 tickets were scanned for the event. The Trump campaign has disputed that number, saying that the attendance figure was actually closer to 12,000.", "What\u2019s not in dispute, though, is that the campaign cancelled speeches that were planned for an outdoor overflow crowd when that crowd didn\u2019t materialize.", "But you wouldn\u2019t know that by looking at Trump fan accounts on social media, which have been posting a picture of an outdoor crowd near Washington, D.C. in 2019 with the bogus claim that it shows the overflow crowd in Tulsa.", "Many of the pictures were shared with a caption attached that claimed: \u201cA small crowd has gathered for the Trump Rally in Tulsa\u00a0\u201c", "The Berks County Republican Committee\u2019s Facebook page posted the picture the day after Trump\u2019s rally with this claim: \u201cSHARE THIS FAR AND WIDE AS THE LEFT IS TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIDN\u2019T SHOW UP FOR TRUMP!\u201d", "But the picture actually shows the start of an annual motorcycle ride through Washington, D.C. that highlights veterans\u2019 issues and honors prisoners of war. It\u2019s hosted by an organization called Rolling Thunder. The picture shows a crowd of participants gathered in the north parking lot of the Pentagon, where the ride began on May 26, 2019.", "Other photos from that day, some of which were featured on the Facebook page for Rolling Thunder Washington, D.C., show a similar angle of the scene as is featured in the picture now being shared with the false information. The same white Jeep is visible in the foreground as is the black truck in the crowd and the white-topped tents.", "Artie Muller, executive director of Rolling Thunder confirmed to FactCheck.org that the photo being shared on social media shows the event. \u201cThat\u2019s how it always looks,\u201d he said.", "So, the picture shows a crowd near Washington, D.C. in 2019, not the crowd for Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Trump, Donald. \u201cRemarks by President Trump in Roundtable Discussion on Fighting for America\u2019s Seniors.\u201d Whitehouse.gov. 15 Jun 2020.", "Wallace, Chris.
