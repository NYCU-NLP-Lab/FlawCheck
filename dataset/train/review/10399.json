The FBI declined to recommend prosecution in Clinton\u2019s case.", "Comey concluded that Clinton was wrong when she repeatedly said that classified emails didn't end up on her personal system and he characterized her handling of very sensitive information as \"extremely careless.\"", "Trump told the crowd at a July 11 campaign rally in Virginia Beach, Va., that Clinton's conduct as \"willful, intentional, and unlawful.\"", "\"Just look at what the FBI director said about her \u2014 her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country,\" Trump said.", "Comey was tough on Clinton, saying at one point that any reasonable person in Clinton's position \"should have known that an unclassified system was no place\" for some of the conversations she was having. But we didn't recall him saying her conduct was \"a disgrace\" or an \"embarrassment.\" So we decided to check it out.", "The Trump campaign doesn't regularly respond to PolitiFact's requests for information. But in this case, the Trump campaign posted the speech (as prepared but without his extemporaneous remarks) with annotations.", "The speech transcript specifically indicates, via the dash, that Trump was explaining the remarks of the FBI director,\u00a0not just giving his own opinion.\u00a0Trump's delivery on video makes it sound that way, too, and that's what caught our attention.", "The campaign said that the source for the \"disgrace and embarrassment\" line came from the Washington Post's transcript of Comey's July 5 news conference.", "We checked. Neither the words \"disgrace\" nor \"embarrassment\" are contained in the transcript.", "We checked Congressional Quarterly's transcript. Same result.", "We wondered if Comey might have used the words during the hours he spent before the House committee two days later. He did not.", "We read his public comments again, looking for words that mean the same thing as a disgrace or an embarrassment. We didn\u2019t find them. Instead, Comey used words that focused on her conduct as showing a lack of attention.", "\"I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That, I could establish. What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent,\" was about as harsh as Comey got.", "He declined to say whether Clinton lied to the public. He did suggest that Clinton may have been less sophisticated about email than most people assumed. \"She didn't have a computer in her office at the State Department, for example,\" Comey said.", "We wondered if anybody used the words \"disgrace\" or \"embarrassment\" during the hearing. They did not.", "Our ruling", "Trump said, \"Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) \u2014 her misconduct \u00a0is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.\"", "The Trump campaign indicated Comey said it during his news conference. He didn't. He said her actions were careless, but he didn\u2019t call them a disgrace or an embarrassment or the equivalent.", "It's possible that Trump was trying to convey two different thoughts, urging people to look up the FBI director's comments and the \"disgrace and embarrassment\" comment was supposed to be his own characterization.", "But that's not how it comes across, both when spoken and in the transcript.", "With that in mind, we rate it False.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b1a6a5e7-b27c-496b-a3cd-73f65def2f05", "C-SPAN, \"Donald Trump Remarks on Veterans' Issues,\" July 11, 2016", "DonaldJTrump.com, \"America First Means Veterans First,\" accessed July 13, 2016", "The Washington Post, \"FBI Director Comey just dropped some shockingly scathing comments about Hillary Clinton's email setup,\" July 5, 2016", "Congressional Quarterly, \"FBI Director Comey Holds News Conference Regarding Investigation of Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Email Server,\" July 5, 2016, and \"House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Holds Hearing on FBI Recommendations on Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Email Server, Panel 1,\" July 7, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
