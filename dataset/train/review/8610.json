Alexandra [sic] Ocasio-Cortez is fairly well-known for spouting out little 'ideas' that most people would figure out were, well, dumb.\u00a0 This time, it seems the Baby Boss has been perusing the proposed budget sheet for the upcoming months, and had her little mind blown by what she saw, leading her to proclaim in an open session of Congress that : 'Wow! We pay soldiers WAY too much!'\"", "As of July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez has never said this, either in a session of Congress or in any other forum.

Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson announced the firings at a press conference, adding, \"This incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department, that these officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. Congressman, a member of our government.
