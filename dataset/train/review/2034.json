Fani-Kayode wrote alongside an image of bloodied, bound men:", "If there were ever a reason or cause for us to go to war, the Libyans have provided it by enslaving our people and buying and selling them like Christmas turkeys and sallah goats. No human being deserves to be caged like an animal and roasted like suya meat.", "The Newsweek story carried the following editor's note:", "This story was updated to strengthen suspicion that Fani-Kayode's Twitter posts feature inauthentic pictures designed to pressure Nigeria to attack Libya.", "At least two of the images were mischaracterized by Fani-Kayode \u2014 they were not taken in Libya, and did not depict people being sold as slaves.

Fani-Kayode claimed these men were slaves who had organs removed. However, that picture, too, was mischaracterized. It first appeared in 2015 and was published by Radio France Internationale (RFI). According to RFI, the men were Eritrean migrants who had been kidnapped and tortured in Egypt.", "We were not immediately able to locate the origins of a third photograph that shows two young men, naked from the waist down, bound and covered in blood.", "Although these images were mischaracterized by Fani-Kayode, a Nigerian former minister of culture and aviation, that does not mean reports of horrors inflicted on migrants traveling north through Africa in an attempt to depart through Libyan ports to Europe are \"fake news.\" In her report for CNN, journalist Nima Elbagir witnessed a slave auction, and spoke to men from countries like Niger, Ghana, Mali and Nigeria housed in a migrant detention center in Tripoli.
