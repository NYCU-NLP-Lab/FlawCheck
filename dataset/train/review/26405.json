Later that night, Trump told Fox News, \"Portland's been burning for many years, for decades it's been burning.\"", "Local authorities and journalists disputed both claims.", "\"We are not on fire.

Rich Chatman, a spokesperson for Portland Fire & Rescue, adding that there has been \"a steady and remarkable decline in the number of fires for the last few years and certainly decades.\"", "Portland, Oregon\u2019s largest city, drew national attention when federal agents swooped in against the wishes of local leaders to protect federal property that they said was at risk because of the protests, which have occurred every night since May.", "Some have included incidents of vandalism and violence, leading businesses near the affected areas to close or board up their windows. But the problems have been mainly confined to small parts of the city, including the area near the federal Hatfield Courthouse.", "\"There\u2019s a lot of damage around the federal courthouse,\" Chatman said. \"But the fact of the matter is this is a very small area of even downtown. We are not under siege.\"", "\"For the average resident of Portland, they probably never lay eyes on some of these fires,\" Chatman added. \"This is a very concentrated area.\"", "The Portland Police Bureau provided PolitiFact with a map and timeline of the protests from May 29 to Aug. 31.

The city, Trump has said, is \"under siege.\"", "But the president\u2019s description of a city gripped by violence and engulfed in flames has been challenged by journalists working in the area.

The fires that have ensued have been quickly extinguished and confined to a few small parts of the city.", "\"Portland is not ablaze, though we do love the Trail Blazers,\" said Anna Griffin, the news director at Oregon Public Broadcasting, in a reference to the city\u2019s NBA team. Street-level activism has been a feature of Portland\u2019s culture for years, Griffin said.", "\"We\u2019re a small city reckoning with centuries of racism \u2014 both within our law enforcement and laws themselves \u2014 and that reckoning isn\u2019t tidy,\" added Alex\u00a0Zielinski, the news editor at the Portland Mercury, an alternative newspaper. \"But no, we\u2019re not on fire.\"", "Trump said of Portland: \"The entire city is ablaze all the time.\"", "While months of protests in Portland have seen many fires set to streets, trash cans, and buildings, those incidents have been confined to a few small sections of the city and relatively easy for the city\u2019s fire department to extinguish.
