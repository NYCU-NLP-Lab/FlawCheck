The nationality of the people seems more Asian\u201d, reads the comment by Sabelo Kotswana.", "Durban is known for having residents of many cultural backgrounds, including a diverse Indian population.", "Kotswana also did a reverse image search and found three links related to India, which led him to believe the post was misleading.", "This 2017 article on the Indian website OfficeChai includes the photo, saying it showed\u00a0 \u201can SBI (State Bank of India) cashier playing a card game on her computer as harried customers waited in line\u201d. It \u201chad gone viral many years ago\u201d, the article adds.", "The image can be found posted on Imgur in 2012 and then again in a Reddit discussion in a post claiming that it was taken at a vehicle registration office in India.", "However, other Reddit users correctly noted that it wasn\u2019t taken at a vehicle registration office.", "One user noticed markings on the back of the woman\u2019s chair -- \u201cSBI/IND/CAH/157\u201d -- and a \u201cdistinctive\u201d pale blue booklet propped up on the counter that they recognised from the bank.", "AFP\u2019s Fact Check team in India helped us look into the detail on the chair and suggested it may show a banking reference code.", "Under the coding system, SBI stands for State Bank of India and IND for India.
