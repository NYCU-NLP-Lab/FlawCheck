Gene Wu, D-Houston, said Republicans should support the expansion of mail-in voting because of the demographics of the party\u2019s supporters.", "\"In Texas, vote-by-mail overwhelmingly benefits Republicans,\" Wu said. \"The average age of the Republican voter is like 20 years older than the average Democrat. It is a lot. Their average age is like 65, or something crazy high like that.\"", "In Texas, state law allows people who meet certain criteria to apply to vote through the mail, which includes any person over 65 years old.", "So, is Wu\u2019s comparison accurate?
