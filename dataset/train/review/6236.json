["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on April 3, 2018", "Q: Did the Obama administration legalize \u201cbump stocks\u201d for semiautomatic rifles?", "A:\u00a0No federal law explicitly addresses \u201cbump stocks.\u201d\u00a0The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled 10 times between 2008 and 2017 that certain models could not be prohibited under existing gun laws.", "I just read on AOL that Trump announced (via tweet of course) the Obama administration legalized the sale of bump stocks. True or false? Naturally, he now takes credit for outlawing them. Please set the record straight.", "A \u201cbump stock\u201d is a plastic or metal device that can be attached to the rear of a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot almost as fast as a fully automatic weapon. The stock uses recoil to make the weapon bump back and forth between the shooter\u2019s shoulder and trigger finger, causing the firearm to fire rapidly.", "The devices became part of the gun debate in October after 64-year-old Stephen Paddock used AR-style rifles affixed with bump stocks to shoot people attending an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. More than 50 people were killed and hundreds more were injured.", "Then, in February, after another deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school, President Donald Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to look into \u201cbanning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.\u201d The Department of Justice announced on March 23 that it was proposing a rule to that effect.", "That same day on Twitter, Trump faulted former President Barack Obama for the devices, saying it was a \u201cbad idea\u201d that his administration had \u201clegalized\u201d bump stocks. Since then, a number of FactCheck.org readers have emailed us, inquiring whether the gun accessories were allowed during Obama\u2019s presidency.", "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018", "The president\u2019s tweet may have left some with the false impression that bump stocks had been illegal and the Obama administration made some change in the law. That\u2019s not the case. Instead, whether bump stocks are legal depends on how exactly different models function. At issue is whether the devices meet the definition of \u201cmachinegun\u201d under federal firearm laws, which have prohibited, with some exceptions, the transfer and possession of a \u201cmachinegun\u201d since 1986.", "Federal law defines a machine gun as a weapon that \u201cshoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d The definition says it also includes \u201cthe frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.\u201d", "In December, the Department of Justice announced it would launch a regulatory process \u201cto determine whether bump stocks are prohibited.\u201d", "It\u2019s true that, under Obama, the ATF \u2014 an agency within the Justice Department \u2014 ruled that it could not prevent the use of certain models of bump stocks.", "In June 2010, for example, the bureau responded to a request to evaluate a product sold by Slide Fire Solutions, a Texas company that makes the devices. In a letter, John Spencer, then the ATF\u2019s Firearms Technology Branch chief, wrote that the device examined had no \u201cfunctioning mechanical parts or springs\u201d that made it perform like an automatic weapon.", "\u201cIn order to use the installed device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAccordingly, we find that the \u2018bump-stock\u2019 is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.\u201d", "The ATF, under Trump, also made a similar determination in April 2017, about a different model of bump stock.", "In that letter, Michael Curtis, the head of ATF\u2019s Firearms Technology Industry Services Branch, wrote: \u201cThe FTISB examination of the submitted device indicates that if as a shot is fired \u2014 and a sufficient amount of pressure is applied to the handguard/gripping surface with the shooter\u2019s support hand \u2014 the AR-type rifle assembly will come forward until the trigger re-contacts the shooter\u2019s stationary firing-hand trigger finger: Re-contacting allows the firing of a subsequent shot. In this manner, the shooter pulls the receiver assembly forward to fire each shot, each succeeding shot firing with a single trigger function.\u201d", "\u201cSince your device does not initiate an automatic firing cycle by a single function of the trigger,\u201d Curtis said, \u201cFTISB finds that it is NOT a machinegun under the [National Firearms Act], or the amended [Gun Control Act].\u201d", "In fact, in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register in December, the ATF said \u201csince 2008,\u201d which predates Obama\u2019s time in office, \u201cATF has issued a total of 10 private letters in which it classified various bump stock devices to be unregulated parts or accessories, and not machineguns or machinegun conversion devices as defined\u201d in federal gun laws.", "The letters were sent to individuals and manufacturers who voluntarily submitted devices for classification. Because the letters are private, the ATF does not make them readily available to the public without the recipient\u2019s consent.", "Slide Fire posted its June 2010 letter from the ATF on its website. The letter the ATF sent in 2017 under Trump was obtained from the Justice Department by the Giffords Law Center and Democracy Forward, which, according to BuzzFeed, filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The recipient\u2019s name was redacted.", "We asked the ATF for the dates the letters were sent, and we were referred to the agency\u2019s March 29 rulemaking proposal that only mentions a range of 2008 to 2017. Still, that suggests that at least one of the letters was sent during the George W. Bush administration. That\u2019s in addition to the letter we know was issued under Trump\u2019s administration.", "Some bump stocks have been deemed illegal, though.", "In an April 2013 letter to Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter, Richard Marianos, then ATF assistant director for public and governmental affairs, wrote: \u201cThose bump-fire stocks which were found to convert a weapon to shoot automatically were classified as machineguns and regulated accordingly, most notably, the Akins Accelerator.\u201d", "Marianos said the Akins Accelerator, an attachment patented by former U.S. Marine Bill Akins in 2000, \u201cincorporated a mechanism to automatically reset and activate the fire-control components of a firearm\u201d after a single pull of the trigger. That meets the definition of a machine gun. The ATF ruling was made in 2006, and was later upheld by a federal appeals court.", "On the other hand, Marianos said devices like the Slide Fire stock, which \u201crequires continuous multiple inputs by the user for each successive shot,\u201d could not be classified as a restricted firearm. \u201cTherefore, ATF does not have the authority to restrict their lawful possession, use, or transfer,\u201d he said.", "The ATF under Trump now disputes that interpretation and wants to classify all bump stocks as federally banned weapons.", "Its proposed rule seeks to clarify that a machine gun includes \u201cbump-stock-type devices, i.e, devices that allow a semiautomatic firearm to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger by harnessing the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm to which it is affixed so that the trigger resets and continues firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.\u201d The agency says it has reviewed the \u201crelevant statutory language\u201d and determined that bump stocks do turn semiautomatic firearms into automatic ones.", "It argues: \u201cWhen a shooter who has affixed a bump-stock-type device to a semiautomatic firearm pulls the trigger, that movement initiates a firing sequence that produces more than one shot. And that firing sequence is \u2018automatic\u2019 because the device harnesses the firearm\u2019s recoil energy in a continuous back-and-forth cycle that allows the shooter to attain continuous firing after a single pull of the trigger, so long as the trigger finger remains stationary on the device\u2019s ledge (as designed). Accordingly, these devices are included under the definition of machinegun and, therefore, come within the purview of the [National Firearms Act].\u201d", "The proposed rule would require those who possess, sell or make bump stocks to destroy them, surrender them or permanently render them inoperable.", "Trump, though, got ahead of himself during a speech in Ohio on March 30 when he claimed that his administration \u201cgot rid of the bump stocks,\u201d but \u201cnobody reported it.\u201d In fact, some bump stocks are still legal. A final rule cannot be issued until after the public comment period ends June 27.", "Even then, gun rights groups and advocates have said any final rule could be challenged in court. They argue that the ATF is changing the definition of a machine gun, which they say can only be done by Congress.", "Sen. Dianne Feinstein agrees with that assessment. She, along with fellow Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, introduced a bill in October that would ban bump stocks and similar devices. It has received a committee hearing, but not a vote.", "\u201cIf ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting repeatedly that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years, and that would mean bump stocks would continue to be sold,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement in February.", "\u201cLegislation is the only answer,\u201d she said.", "Buchanan, Larry, et al. \u201cWhat Is a Bump Stock and How Does It Work?\u201d New York Times. 20 Feb 2018.", "\u201cATF: Las Vegas shooter had 12 guns modified to mimic automatics \u2013 live updates.\u201d CBS News. 3 Oct 2017.", "White House. \u201cPresidential Memorandum on the Application of the Definition of Machinegun to \u2018Bump Fire\u2019 Stocks and Other Similar Devices.\u201d 20 Feb 2018.", "Rose, Veronica, and Reilly, Meghan. \u201cSummary of State and Federal Machine Gun Laws.\u201d Office of Legislative Research, Connecticut General Assembly. 12 Jan 2009.", "U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
