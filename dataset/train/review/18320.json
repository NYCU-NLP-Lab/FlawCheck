["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "It\u2019s a set part of Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s spiel to talk about how he \"inherited a $2.4 billion deficit\" when he took office in January 2014 and managed, with the bipartisan help of legislators, to balance the state budget.", "In a recent PolitiFact, we checked McAuliffe\u2019s claim that the shortfall was left behind by his predecessor, Republican Bob McDonnell. We noted that McDonnell proposed a balanced budget before leaving office and records show that the brunt of the economic slowdown that caused the shortfall, although not McAuliffe\u2019s fault, occurred during his watch. We rated that claim Mostly False.", "The governor added a new element to the claim on Dec. 10 during his monthly radio show on WRVA in Richmond. \"I came in with a record deficit I inherited,\" said McAuliffe, a Democrat.", "Without rehashing details of the \"inherited\" part of his statement, we decided to examine McAuliffe\u2019s claim that the $2.4 billion shortfall he confronted was \"a record deficit\" for Virginia.", "Records show the state faced a far greater crisis at the start of 2010, when McDonnell was succeeding Democrat Tim Kaine as governor and Virginia began suffering the full effects of the Great Recession. Two reports by the General Assembly\u2019s budget committees at that time identified a shortfall of almost $4.5 billion for the two-year budget that would begin July 1, 2010.", "Brian Coy, McAuliffe\u2019s director of communications, told us the governor \"misspoke\" in claiming he faced a deficit record. The reason for the mistake requires a little explanation.", "McAuliffe, as we noted in a Nov. 16 fact check, typically follows his claim about inheriting a $2.4 billion deficit with the kicker that he and lawmakers adroitly turned the problem \"into a record surplus.\"", "He offered the same kicker on WRVA, noting that the so-called \"record deficit\" is \"now a record surplus.\"", "Coy said McAuliffe inadvertently used the adjective \"record\" to describe both budget developments instead of just the surplus. \"When you talk to the public all day, sometimes you have a slip of the tongue,\" Coy said.", "We know of no other instance where the governor made a similar claim about the shortfall.", "The record surplus stems from McAuliffe\u2019s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. That slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year ending in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. But it should be added that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest.", "Some people seeing all these figures might conclude that Virginia\u2019s budget has made an almost $3 billion rebound during the past year -- from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. As we\u2019ve noted before, that\u2019s not the case.", "McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state\u2019s economic problems in August 2014, when they adjusted the two-year budget to a \"pessimistic\" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe now cites.", "Our ruling", "McAuliffe said the $2.4 billion budget shortfall he and lawmakers resolved last year was \"a record deficit\" for Virginia. When we questioned about the assertion, a spokesman said the governor misspoke.", "Indeed, the reddest ink in Virginia was seen in 2010, when the state, in the teeth of recession, faced a $4.5 billion shortfall for the coming two-year budget.", "We don\u2019t suggest the crisis McAuliffe faced was peanuts or question the explanation that he made a simple \"slip of the tongue.\"", "But words matter, and we rate McAuliffe\u2019s statement False.", "Terry McAuliffe, comments on WRVA\u2019s \"Ask the Governor, Dec. 10, 2015.", "PolitiFact Virginia, \"McAuliffe says he \u2018inherited large deficit\u2019 and turned it into a surplus,\" Nov. 16, 2015.", "House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, \"Summary of Governor\u2019s Proposed 2010-2012 Budget,\" Jan. 11, 2010.", "House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, \"Summary of Budget Actions,\" June 29, 2010.", "Interview with Brian McCoy, director of communications for McAuliffe, Dec. 17, 2015.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
