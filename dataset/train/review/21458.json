["Democratic presidential candidate former vice president Joe Biden, speaks during the Democratic primary debate, Thursday, June 27, 2019, in Miami (AP).", "Sen. Kamala Harris of California attacked Joe Biden for his position on busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.", "In the second democratic debate in Miami, Harris said that Biden worked with segregationist senators to oppose busing.", "Harris asked Biden: \"do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?\"", "Biden responded: \"No. \u2026 I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That\u2019s what I opposed.\"", "(We\u2019ll note the Education Department wasn\u2019t established until 1979, but his general point was that he opposed busing if it was federally mandated either directly or through funding rules.)", "We found that Biden tried to oversimplify his complicated record on busing. He glossed over the fact that he regularly opposed busing, even though he supported other civil rights measures such as the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.", "Biden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he faced white constituents who hated the idea of busing. A federal court order in 1974 to integrate Wilmington schools brought the issue home for Biden. In the Senate, Biden began supporting much of the anti-busing legislation.", "University of New Hampshire historian Jason Sokol, who tracked Biden\u2019s response to local opposition, has told us the amendments that Biden supported \"paint a somewhat muddled picture.\" Biden proposed some amendments that would have hamstrung desegregation while at other times he backed off.", "Sokol told us after the debate that Biden\u2019s position on busing evolved but by the late 1970s he was decidedly against busing.", "Biden\u2019s claim that he was for integration but against busing doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, he told PolitiFact. \"By that point in history, there were very few school districts voluntarily integrating by other means, which is why judges were ordering busing. He is using disingenuous logic,\" he said.", "The Biden campaign pointed to exceptions, including in 1974 when he voted to table an anti-busing amendment sponsored by Sen. Edward Gurney, R-Fla..", "The amendment to an education bill was tabled by a single vote on May 15, 1974. The New York Times called the vote a victory for liberals.", "In 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina conservative who opposed civil rights, while stating he didn\u2019t share all the views of those who opposed busing.", "The amendment was intended to prevent the federal government from collecting any data about the race of students or teachers in an effort to protect districts that refused to integrate.", "\"I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept that, in fact, does not bear any of the fruit for which it was designed,\" Biden said. \"If anything, it obfuscates the real issue today which is whether or not there is equal opportunity within the educational field for all people within the United States.\"", "Biden urged his colleagues to reject busing and focus on access to housing, employment, credit, and voting rights, wrote Brett Gadsden, Northwestern University historian and author of \"Between North and South: Delaware, Desegregation, and the Myth of American Sectionalism.\"", "When the Helms amendment defeated, Biden proposed an amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to assign teachers or students to schools based on race.", "Biden said that his amendment would not preclude court-ordered busing, Gadsden wrote, making it an \"admission of a certain incongruity between his legislative efforts and the concerns of his white constituents who were concerned about an impending court-ordered busing mandate.\"", "The Senate affirmed Biden\u2019s amendment by a vote of 50\u201343.", "Biden then introduced another amendment that narrowly targeted busing \u2014 rather than roundly forbidding all desegregation remedies. This amendment passed, too. The Senate passed the education bill with Biden\u2019s anti-busing amendments, but after the House-Senate conference they were dropped from the final bill.", "The Washington Post this year cited an interview Biden gave to the People Paper, a Newark, Del., publication, in 1975:", "\"To 'desegregate' is different than to 'integrate.' . . . I am philosophically opposed to quota systems. They insure mediocrity.\"", "In his book \"Promises to Keep,\" Biden recounted facing a group of constituents who were angry about busing during the 1978 election.", "\"Look, I told them, I was against busing to remedy de facto segregation owing to housing patterns and community comfort,\" he said, recounting what he told people in a high school gym in Wilmington. \"But if it was intentional segregation, I\u2019d personally pay for helicopters to move the children. There were howls in the crowd.\"", "Biden\u2019s campaign pointed to a news story about Biden in 1975 in which he defended busing in certain scenarios.", "\"In cases where a school system has racially segregated by gerrymandering district lines or by other legalistic means, Biden said he supports desegregation by any legal means at hand \u2013 including busing,\" according to the Wilmington News Journal. \"However, for school districts which are all white or all black \u2018because of historical pattern not involving segregation practices disapproved by a court\u2019 he is against busing.\"", "The Biden campaign pointed to examples of African Americans, both in the past and this year, who criticized the idea of busing in major cities in the U.S.", "\"It was the biggest sham,\" said longtime Wilmington education activist Bebe Coker told the Delaware News Journal in April. \"It destroyed our community.\"", "Biden said \"I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education.\"", "Biden qualified his opposition to busing by saying opposing the federal government forcing busing on communities. But the record shows Biden opposed busing, as shown through his positions on legislation, and statements multiple times starting the mid 1970s. We\u2019ll note that while Biden opposed busing in the face of protests from his constituents, he nevertheless supported many other aspects desegregation and civil rights.", "We rate Biden\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "News Journal, Joe Biden's complicated opposition to busing plan, April 22, 2019", "New York Times, Biden opposed busing despite other civil rights advocacy, June 21, 2019", "Washington Post, Tensions ripple through Biden campaign as his past working relationship with a segregationist senator comes to the forefront, June 20, 2019", "Washington Post, Back on the trail, Biden\u2019s message rankles the left, Oct. 6, 2017", "Washington Post, Biden\u2019s tough talk on 1970s school desegregation plan could get new scrutiny in today\u2019s Democratic Party, March 7, 2019", "Politico op-ed by Northwestern University historian, Here\u2019s how deep Biden\u2019s busing problem runs, May 5, 2019", "New York Times, Court Says Denver Can End Forced Busing, Sept. 7, 1995", "New York Times, Busing of Pupils Upheld In a Senate Vote of 47\u201046, May 16, 1974", "Los Angeles Times, Black Mayors Try To End Mandatory School Busing, Nov. 16, 1993", "Congressional Record, Sept. 17, 1975", "PolitiFact, Progressive Democratic group's attack on Joe Biden's voting record needs some context, April 26, 2019", "Interview, Andrew Bates, Joe Biden campaign spokesman, June 28, 2019", "Interview, Jason Sokol, associate professor of history, University of New Hampshire, June 28, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
