The photograph was first published in 2014, and apparently depicted a person not from the United States:", "A Facebook page was one of several social media users or entities to assert that news outlets \"took the bait\", covering the hashtag as a legitimate Clinton campaign effort.", "That article was clearly marked as an unvetted \"community\" submission, and contained obviously satirical content:", "I wonder what Donald will have to say about this one\u2026 I\u2019m sure my wife would be proud to stand up to Russia\u2019s homophobic and Christian ways. #ImWithHer #EnlistForHillary #DraftOurDaughters\nRemember to vote November 12th!", "It didn't take all that much digging to discover #DraftOurDaughters was the work of Clinton opponents, as commenters on the subreddit r/The_Donald explained:", "The #DraftOurDaughters hashtag was not an official Hillary Clinton campaign effort. The trend originated on 4chan's /pol/, where users cooked up fake campaign ads and arranged to spread them on social media in an attempt to dupe fellow users. Separate threads on /pol/ laid out the plan and directed users to create as many versions of the memes as possible with which to flood social media, and there was no question the ads were neither legitimate nor reflected an actual Clinton campaign effort.", "Clinton has gone on record supporting legislation to include women in the draft, but has also clarified that she favors an all-volunteer military:", "\u201cI am on record as supporting the all-volunteer military, which I think at this time does serve our country well,\u201d Clinton told The Huffington Post. \u201cAnd I am very committed to supporting and really lifting up the men and women in uniform and their families.\u201d", "The effort was one of several coordinated trolling efforts by the board and similar forums.
