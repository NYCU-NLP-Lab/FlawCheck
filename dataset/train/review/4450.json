["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on January 6, 2020", "An old tweet from an account impersonating Rep. Rashida Tlaib resurfaced on social media \u2014 this time with an erroneous claim that the tweet was her response to the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.", "Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American from Michigan, has been a frequent target of online misinformation\u00a0since becoming one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018.", "In early 2019, a tweet from an unverified user posing as Tlaib posted anti-American remarks. That tweet was exposed as a fake at the time. But now\u00a0that same made-up tweet has resurfaced on Twitter and Facebook in connection with the recent conflict between the\u00a0U.S. and Iran.", "The hoax tweet reads: \u201cAmericans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people. What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling.\u201d", "But, as many outlets wrote in January 2019, that message was not from Tlaib\u2019s account but from a since-deleted Twitter account made to resemble it. The fake Twitter account was not verified (unlike Tlaib\u2019s verified personal and congressional accounts) and its handle \u2014 @RashidaTIaib \u2014 used a capital \u201ci\u201d rather than an \u201cl\u201d in \u201cTlaib.\u201d", "The latest viral\u00a0meme shows a screenshot of another Twitter user sharing the fake Tlaib tweet and calling the congresswoman \u201canti-american\u201d and someone \u201cwho should not be in office.\u201d (That user later apologized upon learning the Tlaib tweet was bogus.)", "The meme also adds the caption: \u201cThis was her comment on the Protesters Siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iraqi.\u201d", "As we said, Tlaib didn\u2019t make those comments in a tweet \u2014 let alone in response to an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, in which protesters set fire to a reception building. The Dec. 31 attack was part of escalating aggression between the U.S. and Iran that further deepened after the U.S. killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 2 with an airstrike in Baghdad.", "Tlaib has used Twitter to speak out against a potential war with Iran, calling it \u201cyet another unnecessary war that puts innocent lives at risk at home.\u201d", "Addressing the spread of the fake tweet, Tlaib wrote on Jan. 6 that such falsehoods \u201cendanger my life.\u201d And she reminded users to verify that tweets purportedly from her are actually hers:", "Quick public servant announcement: If there isn't a checkmark next to my name on the tweet then it's fake!", "To all the foreign countries & reckless commentators out there spreading lies about me: Try to focus on disagreeing with me with facts, instead of making up shit. pic.twitter.com/DPxdZSEKP0", "\u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) January 6, 2020", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
