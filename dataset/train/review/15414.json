I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2018", "This wasn't the first time that Trump claimed he had foreseen the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In November 2015, for example, he told a crowd in Knoxville, Tennessee, that he wrote in his book that \"Osama bin Laden is going to come and do damage and nobody believed me\":", "Trump repeated this claim during a December 2015 interview on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' show, saying that \"nobody really knew who (Osama) was\" before the attack on the World Trade Center and that he had written in his book that the military \"better take him out\":", "I said we better be careful with Osama bin Laden. There\u2019s a guy named Osama bin Laden. Nobody really knew who he was. But he was nasty. He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it. And I wrote in the book [in] 2000 -- two years before the World Trade Center came down -- I talked to you about Osama bin Laden, you better take him out. I said he\u2019s going to crawl under a rock. You better take him out.

We\u2019re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We\u2019re playing tournament chess \u2014 one master against many rivals. One day we\u2019re all assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything\u2019s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan.

However, he did not \"predict\" that Osama bin Laden would be the mastermind behind such an attack. Furthermore, he assumed that such an incident would involve nuclear or biological weapons:", "I really am convinced we\u2019re in danger of the sort of terrorist attacks that will make the bombing of the Trade Center look like kids playing with firecrackers. No sensible analyst rejects this possibility, and plenty of them, like me, are not wondering if but when it will happen.", "In our age of miniaturization, weapons have shrunk \u2014 and the threat against us is suddenly very large.
