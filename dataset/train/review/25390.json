Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state.\"", "De Blasio raised the minimum wage for city employees in January 2016, about three months before the New York State Legislature passed a new statewide minimum wage in April. The minimum wage will be phased in to $15 at different rates across the state over the next several years.", "So is de Blasio right about New York City paving the way for the wage increase?", "The fast food wage board", "Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took the first statewide action on a $15 minimum wage in May 2015 when he convened his fast-food wage board.", "The governor cannot unilaterally raise the statewide minimum wage, but the Department of Labor has the authority to raise wages for a specific industry. The fast-food wage board was charged with recommending a pay increase for workers in that industry.", "After four public hearings, the wage board recommended a phased-in minimum wage of $15 for fast-food workers. Acting State Labor Commissioner Mario J. Musolino approved the recommendation in September 2015.", "State and SUNY workers", "Cuomo, two months later in November 2015, announced a minimum wage increase to $15 for state workers.

The action only affected 61 city employees in Syracuse, but the raise took effect immediately.", "The cities of Buffalo and Rochester announced their own minimum wage increases to $15 about a month later in November.

Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state.\"", "De Blasio trailed the pack on this issue.\u00a0Three other cities in New York state gave their public employees a raise before New York City. An increase for state and SUNY workers also came before his action. Fast-food workers were the first to get a raise.", "He did raise the New York City wage before the State Legislature enacted a statewide wage increase.
