But this much is clear: eligibility will not depend on whether Americans respond to the 2020 census, as recent social media posts claim.", "The Trump administration and the Congress recently announced their intention to send direct cash payments within weeks to U.S. citizens as part of a stimulus package to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.", "But a post being shared on Facebook falsely claims that completing the 2020 census form \u2014 which began arriving in mailboxes across the country this month \u2014 is a prerequisite for receiving these payments. \u201cGo to 2020census.gov and fill out this census form so you can get your stimulus check. That\u2019s how they going to know where to send the checks,\u201d the post claims, adding: \u201cIf you don\u2019t fill it out you will not receive a check in the mail.\u201d", "That\u2019s false.\u00a0\u201cYour [census] answers cannot be used to impact your eligibility for any government benefits, including any potential stimulus package,\u201d the 2020 census website explains.", "As we\u2019ve reported, the Treasury Department proposed a plan that would provide loans to airlines and small businesses, as well as direct payments to individuals and families.", "The Treasury plan calls for two direct payments to taxpayers totaling $500 billion. The first payment would be issued within three weeks, and a second payment of the same amount in six weeks if the economic disruption caused by the pandemic continues.", "Each payment to individuals \u201cwould be fixed and tiered based on income level and family size,\u201d the Treasury plan states.", "The details \u2014 including who is eligible and how much they will receive \u2014 are still being hashed out by Congress, as leaders of both parties continue to negotiate.", "Under legislation proposed by Senate Republicans, according to the pro-business Tax Foundation,\u00a0individual adults would receive $1,200 each, plus $500 for each child. At higher incomes, the checks would get smaller. The reductions start at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.", "The Senate bill would use tax returns \u2014 not 2020 census information \u2014 as the basis for determining who is eligible and how much they will receive.", "It is important to note that everyone living in the U.S. and American territories should complete the census forms arriving in the mail or go to 2020census.gov to participate. The\u00a0Constitution\u00a0mandates that the U.S. population be counted every 10 years in order to determine the number of representatives each state should have and to distribute federal funds.", "But the census will not be used to determine coronavirus-related relief benefits, and failure to complete this year\u2019s census will not preclude an individual from receiving aid through this stimulus package.", "Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27. Adults with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will receive $1,200 (married couples with an adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less will receive $2,400, plus $500 per child). The payment amount will scale down by income, phasing out at $99,000 for single individuals and $198,000 for couples without children.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
