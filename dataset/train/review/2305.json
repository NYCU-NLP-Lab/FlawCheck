["By Caroline Wallace", "Posted on April 21, 2017", "Q: Did the Supreme Court rule that public schools cannot teach students about Islam?", "A: No. That false claim was spread by a network of fake news websites.", "Did the Supreme Court just shut down the teaching of Islam in our schools? Did Judge Gorsuch cast the deciding vote?", "No, the Supreme Court hasn\u2019t\u00a0decided that students can\u2019t be taught about Islam in public schools. On April 11, fake news websites began publishing a bogus story that said\u00a0\u201c[t]he court ruled 5-4, with Justice Gorsuch casting the tie-breaker, that the only Islam taught to our children in public schools will be the history of Radical Islam and what they can do to help stop it.\u201d", "It alleged\u00a0that newly installed\u00a0Justice Neil Gorsuch\u00a0wrote the majority opinion, and then provided a faux excerpt that was filled with errors: \u201cWe should [sic] be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Chritianity [sic], as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn\u2019t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a \u2018religion of peace\u2019 when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.\u201d", "Suspicious Facebook users have rightly flagged the bogus story as potentially fake, using the social media site\u2019s improved tools for reporting a hoax.", "Gorsuch hasn\u2019t yet authored an opinion for the court. He was confirmed\u00a0by the Senate on April 7 and was sworn in on April 10. He didn\u2019t hear his first cases as a member of the court until April 17, nearly one week after the fake news story began circulating. And the court\u2019s hearings list for the session beginning April 17 doesn\u2019t include any cases dealing with Islam being taught\u00a0in public schools.", "The made-up\u00a0story originated on a\u00a0website known as the Resistance, or America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.

Schempp\u00a0that teaching public school students about religion was acceptable.", "At the time, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote in his majority opinion: \u201cIt might well be said that one\u2019s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.\u201d", "The court has not voted to change that.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "De Vogue, Ariane and Dan Berman. \u201cNeil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.\u201d CNN. 7 Apr 2017.", "Totenberg, Nina. \u201cJustice Gorsuch Finds His \u2018Easier\u2019 Solution Has Few Takers On 1st Day.\u201d NPR. 17 Apr 2017.", "Supreme Court of the United States. 2016 Term Opinions of the Court.
