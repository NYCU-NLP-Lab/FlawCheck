["About this rating", "On 20 December 2016, several social media users claimed that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani was suspended from Twitter. The\u00a0rumor is based on the suspension of @RudolphGiuliani, a Twitter account that frequently posted about #Pizzagate, a baseless (but complicated)\u00a0conspiracy theory\u00a0about a\u00a0massive pedophilia ring was being run out a Washington, D.C. pizzeria.", "Shortly before this account was suspended on 20 December 2016, it published an image purporting to be an \"official statement\" from Giuliani about the\u00a0conspiracy theory:", "While it is true that the @RudolphGiuliani account was suspended by Twitter on 20 December 2016 after posting several messages about Pizzagate, this account was not affiliated with the\u00a0former mayor of New York. \u00a0The @RudolphGiuliani account was not verified, and this statement was not posted via any official channels. Giuliani also doesn't have an official Twitter account.", "In November 2016, another Giuliani parody (@rudygiulianiGOP) made the news when NBC's Chuck Todd questioned the former Mayor about a\u00a0fake tweet. Guiliani said that he was aware of at least four accounts that post hoax\u00a0content in his name:", "\u201cI didn't tweet that. That's not my tweet. I never said that. That\u2019s somebody pretending to be me. There are about four of them out there that pretend to be me,\u201d explained Giuliani.", "Concha, Joe. \u00a0 \"Chuck Todd fooled by Giuliani parody account.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Hill. \u00a0 3 October 2016.", "Menegus, Bryan. \u00a0 \"Won't Someone Please Make Rudy Giuliani a Twitter Account?.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Gizmodo. \u00a0 21 December 2016.", "McLeod, Paul. \u00a0 \"This Rudy Giuliani Account People Are Retweeting Is Fake.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Buzzfeed. \u00a0 8 November 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
