["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on February 26, 2020", "A meme circulating on Facebook claims without evidence that Hillary Clinton has made $95.5 million since she ran for president in 2016, and falsely implies that she and former President Barack Obama enriched themselves by \u201csteal[ing] your money.\u201d", "A meme circulating on Facebook compares what it claims to be the net worth of President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton before and after they ran for president.", "But it uses unsubstantiated numbers for Trump and Obama, and gets them wrong for Clinton.", "Here\u2019s how the meme assesses their wealth:", "It concludes, \u201cBut Trump is the guy trying to steal your money?\u201d", "These claims have been around, in some version, since at least 2017.", "The oldest version we could find was posted in November 2017 on a Facebook page called President Trump Fans. That post used almost the same numbers; the only difference is that it pegged Trump at $3.5 billion after the election. It said that the numbers represented the fortunes of the \u201cTrumps,\u201d the \u201cObamas,\u201d and the \u201cClintons.\u201d", "In October 2018, conservative activist Charlie Kirk tweeted the same numbers used in the current meme, attributing them to the \u201cTrump family,\u201d \u201cObama,\u201d and \u201cClinton.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify which Clinton he meant, Hillary or former President Bill Clinton. Then, in June 2019, the Facebook page for TrendingPolitics.com \u2014 which describes itself as \u201cpro-Trump\u201d \u2014 shared the version of the claim that\u2019s currently circulating on Facebook. It paired the numbers with a picture of each politician and used a photo of Hillary Clinton.", "The latest version of the claim makes it appear as if Clinton has earned more than $95.5 million since she was the Democratic nominee for president in 2016. Actually, she and the former president had an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million in 2015, according to the tax return that she made public during the campaign. The financial disclosure she filed \u2014 which requires public officials and presidential candidates estimate the value of their assets in wide ranges \u2014 showed that the Clintons had between $10 million and $50 million in the bank or invested in an index fund in 2015.", "The claim that she was worth $480,000 is likely a product of confusion from the original claim, which may have been referring to Bill Clinton\u2019s net worth before he ran for president in 1992. Reports at the time put the couple\u2019s net worth below $1 million.", "When he left office in 2001, however, Bill and Hillary Clinton were saddled with legal debt\u00a0amassed during the scandal investigations and impeachment proceedings. They grew their wealth, largely, through lucrative speaking engagements and book deals over the last two decades.", "It\u2019s hard to tell how much money they have now, since neither Clinton is in public office and they don\u2019t have to disclose their assets. But it\u2019s likely that they have more than they did in 2016, given the release of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2017 book, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d which broke sales records at the time.", "That speaks to the larger implication of this meme. By asking, \u201cBut Trump is the guy trying to steal your money?\u201d the meme suggests that Obama and Clinton enriched themselves at taxpayer expense. But in both cases the bulk of the money came from their work in the private sector.", "For Barack and Michelle Obama, $15.6 million of the $20.5 million that they earned between 2005 and 2016 came from books written by the former president, according to a 2017 Forbes analysis. Two of the books, \u201cThe Audacity of Hope\u201d and \u201cDreams from My Father,\u201d were published before he became president, and a third book for children was published in 2010. Just over $3 million came from the presidential salary for eight years.", "Since leaving the White House, Barack and Michelle Obama have signed onto high-profile deals, including one reportedly worth $60 million for a pair of memoirs. The first, written by Michelle Obama, was released in November 2018 and became the best-selling book that year. The couple also signed a television series and movie production deal with Netflix, but the amount they\u2019ll make from it isn\u2019t clear. One early report described it as a \u201chigh 8-figure deal.\u201d", "Like the Clintons, the Obamas\u2019 net worth is difficult to calculate since they are no longer required to file financial disclosures.", "As for Trump\u2019s net worth, the meme is generally on target.", "Analyses from Forbes and Bloomberg in 2019 estimated his net worth at about $3 billion, and a Forbes investigation from 2016 put Trump\u2019s net worth at about $4.5 billion in 2015.", "The president has faced criticism, though, for breaking with the long-standing tradition that presidential candidates release their tax returns. Trump refused to do so during the 2016 election and has continued to keep them private since then. He does file annual financial disclosure reports, as required by law. But the Center for Responsive Politics has reported that the president\u2019s disclosure \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a full picture of Trump\u2019s income, as it lists assets and debts \u2014 along with some income amounts \u2014 in wide ranges.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
