The article further stated that he is a resident of Sikri, Bharatpur district in Rajasthan. Mukim was lingering around in a nearby village where he was beaten up by a group of people over suspicion of his involvement in braid-chopping incidents. The victim was brutally beaten up and was left to die. Those present at the scene had shot a video of this incident. The cops arrived at the scene after receiving information about the incident and later got to know during the enquiry that Mukim was mentally ill and hence couldn\u2019t explain or defend himself while he was being beaten up. At the time, police had arrested nine people in the case that was registered by the victim\u2019s father Baljeet.", "Alt News contacted Sikri police who corroborated that the incident indeed took place in Sikri, Bharatpur, Rajasthan.
