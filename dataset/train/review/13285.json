["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on July 15, 2020", "Social media posts claim that Betsy DeVos said \u201conly\u201d 0.02% of children are \u201clikely to die\u201d of\u00a0COVID-19 from schools reopening in the fall. There\u2019s no evidence she ever said that.", "As a new school year approaches amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has been publicly advocating for a full reopening of K-12 schools across the country, drawing critics who say the move stands to risk the health of children and teachers.", "But across social media platforms, that criticism has taken the form of a fictitious quote attributed to DeVos concerning how many children could die as a result of reopening.", "\u201cBetsy DeVos said \u2018only\u2019 .02% of kids are likely to die when they go back to school during the pandemic,\u201d reads a meme shared on Facebook. \u201cThat\u2019s 14,740 children.\u201d", "The claim also appeared on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0and a\u00a0July 12 tweet spreading the falsehood was retweeted nearly 70,000 times. In some cases, the quote is dated July 10.", "But we could find no public comments in which DeVos made that remark on that day \u2014 or any other. Nor could our fact-checking friends at Lead Stories and Snopes.", "DeVos did partake in several interviews, including on CNN and Fox News, on July 12, in which she pressed for schools to reopen and said that young people contract the virus at lower rates than their adult counterparts.", "\u201cWe know that children get the virus at a far lower rate than any other part of the population,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash.", "An April report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that among nearly 150,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases for which age was known, less than 2% were children under age 18.", "The CDC also cites a study of pediatric patients with COVID-19 conducted in China, which found that the vast majority of cases in children were either \u201cmild\u201d or \u201cmoderate.\u201d Of the patients studied, 5% were \u201csevere\u201d and 0.6% were \u201ccritical.\u201d", "In rare cases, children with COVID-19 have\u00a0developed\u00a0a serious illness known as multisystem inflammation syndrome, or MIS-C.", "Still, there are many unanswered questions about the rates in which children get and transmit the virus \u2014 especially since asymptomatic cases are less likely to be tested.", "As for the supposed statistic in the viral posts, we found no instances of DeVos citing any such figure in her interviews or other public appearances. So it\u2019s not clear how the \u201c\u2018only\u2019 0.02%\u201d quote came to be.", "We did come across a different viral Facebook text post, published on July 8, that also made reference to DeVos and tied a different figure to another administration official.", "That post claimed that Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said that \u201cmost children probably won\u2019t die. Maybe 0.1%.\u201d But that too was an inaccurate\u00a0retelling of what Birx said at a\u00a0July 8 task force press briefing\u00a0(at which DeVos was also present).", "When a reporter asked her about COVID-19 and children, including the infection rate among children, Birx said that of the tests performed \u201cthe lowest-tested portion is the under-10-year-olds. So we\u2019re putting into place other ways to get testing results from them and looking at antibody in that discarded samples, and try to really figure this out, because parents have really done an amazing job of protecting their children.\u201d", "She also said \u201cour data is skewed originally to people with symptoms, and then skewed to adults over 18. And so we are looking very closely into that category by using our antibody tests.\u201d", "Birx went on to add: \u201cWe know the mortality rate in under 25 from the CDC data is less than 0.1 percent. And so that has been holding. But until we know how many have been infected, we have no evidence that there is significant mortality in children without coexisting diseases. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for right now, is to really make sure we\u2019ve \u2026 overturned every rock and understand that in deep detail.\u201d", "So even Birx\u2019s actual quote does not resemble the one that is now being baselessly attributed to DeVos.", "It is also unclear how the viral claim calculates that 0.02% of the U.S. school population is \u201c14,740 children.\u201d Federal figures project there will be 56,678,000 children in public and private schools in Fall 2020; 0.02% of that population would be 11,336 students.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
