We will do what is necessary in order to defend ourselves. I suggest to all of them, including Hezbollah, to consider this.\u201d", "\u201cThese are not vain words; they have the weight of the State of Israel and the IDF behind them and this should be taken seriously,\u201d the premier said, according to the other tweet.", "Similar claims also appeared on Facebook here and here, Instagram here and here, and Twitter here and here.", "Other claims using video footage of Netanyahu circulated in Arabic on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp, and were debunked by AFP Fact Check here.", "The August 4 blast at Beirut\u2019s port -- which appears to have been caused by a fire igniting 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate left unsecured in a warehouse -- killed more than 100 people and left thousands wounded.", "Israel and Lebanon are still technically at war, and tensions with the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah have recently spiked.", "However, the tweets quoting Netanyahu -- which were sent hours before the Beirut explosion -- were not referring to Lebanon, but strikes in southern Syria on August 3.
