Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican from New York City, joined in the chorus of Republican criticism against the $1.9 trillion financial relief plan signed by President Joe Biden.", "\"If you are a hard-working law-abiding citizen who earns $80,000, you don\u2019t get a stimulus check,\" Malliotakis wrote on\u00a0Twitter. \"But if you are a convicted murderer or rapist sitting in jail, you do.\"", "The claim has been widely circulated. Is she right?", "The American Rescue Plan Act,\u00a0signed by Biden\u00a0on March 11, provides a stimulus payment of $1,400 a person for those with incomes up to $75,000 if they file their taxes individually. For married couples, each spouse would get $1,400 if their combined income is $150,000 or less. Single filers earning slightly more than $75,000 will receive a smaller stimulus check, as will married couples earning slightly more than $150,000. But the law phases out\u00a0the stimulus checks entirely for individual filers who earn $80,000 or more or a married couple making a combined $160,000 and filing jointly.", "Mallitokis, who represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, made a claim about convicted murderers and rapists in jail. In most cases, people who are awaiting trial are held in jail, and people who have been convicted of serious crimes are in prison. In any case, the incarcerated are eligible for stimulus payments, as long as they meet the income limits and are legal residents or citizens. People who are in jail or prison could have income from pensions, investments or other sources.", "PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim -- that Democrats \"voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,\" and rated it\u00a0Mostly True. The fact-check found that Democrats rejected a Republican amendment that would have barred the checks for people in prison, and that in the past, both parties supported plans with direct payments to prisoners.", "The\u00a0CARES Act, an economic relief package signed by President Trump, also did not bar inmates from claiming the economic impact payment, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center,\u00a0who worked on tax issues at the Congressional Budget Office. The IRS, however, interpreted that law differently. Its decision was challenged, and a court ruling in October reversed the IRS position and allowed prisoners to receive the first round of payments, she said.", "We reached out to Malliotakis' office and did not hear back.", "Her claim about jail inmates receiving stimulus payments is correct, as long as they are under the income limits. This was also true of the CARES Act, enacted under the Trump administration.", "Because her claim is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, we rate it Mostly True.", "Twitter, tweet, @nmalliotakis, March 8, 2021.
