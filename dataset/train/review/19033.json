And that's not all that is wrong with what the meme.", "Spilled milk", "The lawsuit the meme refers to involved two married reporters -- Jane Akre and Steve Wilson -- and their former employer, WTVT Channel 13, a Fox affiliate in Tampa, Fla.", "In 1996, the husband-and-wife team began reporting on the use of Posilac, a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle developed by Monsanto. After eight months of back and forth between the reporters and the station, the story never aired, and the reporters were fired in 1997. Akre and Wilson sued the station for breach of contract and retaliatory firing in 1998.", "Why the reporters lost their jobs is the heart of the case. According to Akre and Wilson, WTVT caved to pressure from Fox corporate and Monsanto, and fired the pair when Akre threatened to take what Akre described as the station\u2019s deliberate news distortion to the Federal Communications Commission. According to WTVT, the reporters submitted a biased and inaccurate report and were terminated after they refused to make the necessary edits.", "In 2000, a Tampa jury ruled that WTVT did indeed retaliate against Akre and awarded her $425,000, the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times)\u00a0reported. WTVT then appealed the case. In 2003, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, arguing that Akre\u2019s retaliation allegation did not hold water.", "Whistleblowing in the dark", "Akre\u2019s allegation and the meme involve the intersection of three pieces of media policy: the FCC\u2019s false news provision, the FCC\u2019s whistleblower\u2019s statute, and the First Amendment.", "According to Akre, WTVT deliberately distorted news by airing a revised version of the Posilac story. That, Akre says, is prohibited under the false news provision. When Akre threatened to notify the FCC, the station fired her and breached the whistleblower statute that prohibits retaliation against employees who disclose an employer\u2019s \"violation of law, rule, or regulation.\"", "The station denied repeatedly that it had tried to broadcast distorted news and said it wanted fair and balanced reports from Akre and Wilson. WTVT argued that the FCC\u2019s news distortion policy is more a rule of thumb than a codified law, and thus not under the purview of the whistleblower statute. The appeals court agreed.", "Stuart Benjamin, a professor of telecommunications at Duke University, said he doesn\u2019t see anything in the legal documents that suggests WTVT admitted to any lies or distortion. Rather, the station argued, and the court agreed, that Akre failed to meet her burden of proof, according to Benjamin.", "\"If a statute prohibits me from hitting you only if I act with malice, and you say that I hit you but don\u2019t establish malice, then I have a simple winning argument in court that you failed to show malice.That doesn\u2019t mean I agree I hit you. It just means I have a winning argument that focuses on the absence of malice,\" he said.", "Freedom of the press", "Beyond what was in writing, Akre doesn\u2019t remember WTVT admitting to lying and defending it as a legal right.", "\"I don\u2019t think they said it just like that, but they basically said we can do what we want,\" Akre told PunditFact. \"They kept saying \u2018we have First Amendment rights,\u2019 meaning they can operate with impunity and have the constitutional right to do so.\"", "The First Amendment, as well as the Florida Constitution, \"prohibits judicial review of Defendants\u2019 news judgments and the exercise of editorial discretion, consistent with the guarantees of a free press,\" the station argued in its defense statement.", "What this means is that the court shouldn\u2019t judge the editing choices of WTVT, the station\u2019s lawyer Patricia Anderson told The Weekly Planet.", "Anderson invoked the First Amendment because it is dangerous for the courts and the FCC to become involved in disputes between members of the media and tread on either party\u2019s freedom of press rights, according to Alison Steele, a media lawyer and Anderson's\u2019 former law partner. (Steele currently represents the Tampa Bay Times, which operates PunditFact.)", "Deni Elliott, a professor of media ethics at the University of South Florida, said that by invoking the First Amendment, Fox is suggesting that they are not accountable to anyone -- \"not a reasonable stand for a news organization to take.\"", "But to infer that WTVT used the First Amendment to defend news distortion and declare impunity is wrong. \"That wasn\u2019t ever their position,\" Steele said.", "\"There was never a factual or logical nexus established between the alleged crippling of the First Amendment and the firing of these two individuals,\" said Thomas McGowan, a media lawyer who was part of WTVT\u2019s defense team.", "Liane Casten, the reporter who wrote the the Chicago Media Watch article that originated the meme, said WTVT admitted to the false news allegations and defended it as a legal right during the trial, but could not recall the specifics. That position, however, is not corroborated by Akre.", "Steele, who worked with WTVT\u2019s attorney, said it\u2019s possible lawyers conceded the point as a hypothetical. But it was never central to their legal argument, nor an admission in the sense Casten or the meme suggests.", "\"I can certainly imagine that in oral argument. The other side says, \u2018If you did do this,\u2019 and you respond, \u2018If I did, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 That\u2019s just part of the refining and defining what the legal argument,\" she said. \"This happens all the time, but it\u2019s not an admission.\"", "The ruling", "The Internet meme claims, \"Fox admits they lie\" and, under the First Amendment, \"have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves.\"", "The claim doesn't track back to the national cable network most people know. Instead, it's\u00a0rooted in a wrongful termination lawsuit between a Tampa Fox affiliate and two reporters.\u00a0The heart of the suit was whether the Fox affiliate wrongly fired the reporters over a story about a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle.", "The reporters and the station disagreed about the accuracy of the story.", "As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for the station argued that the courts do not have the right to play referee on story decisions -- citing the First Amendment.", "We found no evidence that the Fox affiliate admitted that it lied about the news it ultimately presented, and we certainly found no evidence that Fox News\u00a0as a whole admits it lies (in the present tense).", "While the Fox affiliate argued that it has the right to present the news as it chooses, it\u2019s quite a leap to suggest Fox as a television corporation\u00a0defended some right to \"distort news reports\" -- other than in a hypothetical sense to quash a wrongful termination suit.", "This meme wasn\u2019t conjured out of thin air, but it\u2019s not accurate.
