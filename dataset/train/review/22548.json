["About this rating", "On 29 November 2016, disreputable web site\u00a0The Boston Tribune\u00a0published a hoax\u00a0news article appearing to report\u00a0that U.S. President Barack Obama had signed an executive order banning all fake news outlets:", "In wake of the controversial 2016 presidential election, President Obama has signed what may be one of his final executive orders. On Monday morning, President Obama signed Executive Order 13749 banning all fake news websites and ensuring penalties ranging from fines/fees to criminal prosecution for those that own and maintain such websites.", "In the days after President-Elect Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election the topic of fake news has been one of fierce controversy as many point to a myriad of frequently trending- yet fake news articles that were widely circulated on social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter during the election cycle. According to many critics, the rate in which fake news was circulated online unfairly influenced the results of the election.", "The story quoted here was published by\u00a0TheBostonTribune.com,\u00a0a web site\u00a0that has a\u00a0history of publishing hoax\u00a0stories, such as a completely\u00a0baseless claim that Michelle Obama's mother would receive a $160,000 annual government pension, or\u00a0that Wisconsin eliminated\u00a0all \"FoodShare/EBT programs\" as of 1 December 2016.", "In addition to the web site's less-than-nodding acquaintance with\u00a0the truth, a list of executive orders signed by the President is available to the public. While the president did sign two executive orders on 29 November 2016, neither of them was \"Executive Order 13749\" or had anything to do with the media.", "The Boston Tribune\u00a0made a second claim later in their hoax article, when (in a remarkable feat of self-awareness) its author\u00a0wrote that Obama's alleged executive order was spurred by a story published by a fake news outlet, but masquerading as a real news outlet:", "According to multiple sources, the fake news article that was the apparent \u201clast straw\u201d leading-up to President Obama\u2019s decision to sign Executive Order 13749 was an article run on a fake news website with the misleading domain \u2013 www.thebostontribune.com.co. The website was designed to trick readers into thinking that they were reading information from our publication (The Boston Tribune), however \u2013 the almost unnoticeable distinction between our website and this fake website was the \u2018.co\u2019 added to the end of the domain. When we first learned of the copycat website spreading fake news we contacted the publisher of the misleading website (later identified at Aaron Baker) and asked that the website be taken down immediately \u2013 Mr. Baker failed to respond to our request.", "The article published by the fake news website is one that many will recognize as it spread rapidly on Facebook and quickly received over 300,000 shares. It featured the headline \u2013 \u201cUnmotivated Voters Paid $50 To Cast Democratic Vote\u201d.", "While it is true that a common tactic used by purveyors of fake news in 2016 was to publish stories on misleading domain names, anyone attempting to imitate a legitimate news organization by adding \".co\" to\u00a0TheBostonTribune.com would be severely misinformed, as neither version of the\u00a0web site\u00a0is a reliable source for truthful information.", "The one aspect of\u00a0The Boston Tribune's\u00a0report that actually was based in reality was its mention of a speech that President Obama delivered in Berlin about the rampant spread of misinformation on the internet:", "Because in an age where there's so much active misinformation, and it's packaged very well,\u00a0and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,\u00a0where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S.\u00a0official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we've come to take for granted.", "He mentioned nothing about signing a ban into law, because the story reporting that he did so is indisputably false.", "Media Matters. \u00a0 \"President Obama: \"There's So Much Active Misinformation\" That Looks The Same As Actual Information When It's \"On A Facebook Page\" Or On TV.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 17 November 2016.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
