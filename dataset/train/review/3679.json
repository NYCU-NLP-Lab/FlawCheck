Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is.\"", "The ad discusses an event that actually happened but distorts reality. We\u2019ll explain why.", "On July 18, six mayoral candidates gathered in the City Council chambers to participate in a mayoral forum moderated by St. Petersburg\u2019s League of Women Voters.", "The forum had a unique format that didn\u2019t allow for debate.", "Some questions were addressed to all six candidates, and other questions were only addressed to half of the panel. If a question was only addressed to half of the panel, then a candidate who was not asked could wave a \"wildcard\" to signal that he or she wanted to answer the question. Candidates were given three wildcards and were told that there would be no opportunities for rebuttals.", "For the first 30 minutes, the forum went on without a hitch. That changed when Congemi used his wildcard to respond to a question about how to provide recreational activities for youth in the city. The question was only addressed to Theresa \"Momma Tee\" Lassiter, Kriseman, and Jesse Nevel, national chairman of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, which helps\u00a0organizes white support for black-led community social justice.", "\"Mr. Nevel, you and your people, you talk about reparations,\" Congemi said. \"The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama.\"", "Amid boos from the crowd, Congemi added: \"My advice to you, my advice to you, if you don\u2019t like it here in America, planes leave every hour. Go back to Africa, go back to Africa.\"", "Kriseman was seated next to Congemi. As Congemi talked about reparations, Kriseman can be seen with sealed lips, looking around. Another angle shows Kriseman glancing at the crowd and then looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst.", "VIDEO: Paul Congemi, cand for mayor of @StPeteFL tells activists in debate their \"reparations were Barack Obama\" and to \"go back to Africa\" pic.twitter.com/QlSmDhGAPw", "After Congemi\u2019s remarks the crowd continued to bellow in opposition and Nevel called Congemi a \"nonfactor\", but it settled after candidate Anthony Cates III, who is African-American, used his wildcard. He did not address what Congemi said, talking instead about a charity he worked with that helped students.", "After Cates spoke, the moderator asked all six candidates how they would approach the homeless population. Kriseman was the first to answer, and he didn\u2019t mention Congemi.", "Kriseman said his administration had invested money to help family homelessness in the community.", "The question then went to Lassiter and Nevel, who also didn\u2019t mention what Congemi said (though Nevel did dismiss him as a \"nonfactor\" in the midst of Congemi\u2019s rant).", "However, when it was Baker\u2019s turn to talk, he called out Congemi.", "To reiterate my comments at the debate last night.
