Howarth, who has researched the climate-warming effects of methane that escapes into the atmosphere during the lifespan of fracked gas \u2014 from drilling to combustion.", "In fracking, water is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale to free up gas or oil. Methane is released in the process.", "The impact of gases \u2014 methane from coal-burning plants and carbon dioxide from automobiles \u2014 depends on how potent they are and how long they remain in the atmosphere.", "Methane is 100 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas during the 10 years following its emission, according to Howarth. But methane stays in the atmosphere for a little more than a decade, while carbon dioxide, some say, hangs around for 1,000 years.", "The point, Howarth says, is that global warming has moved into a critical period. It\u2019s urgent, he says, to stave off what he calls \"runaway global warming\" \u2014 a scenario he believes is possible during the next 20 years.

The lifetime of carbon dioxide, says the paper, can\u2019t even be characterized, and the gas\u2019s significant greenhouse effects \"persist for millennia.\" Pierrehumbert likens the greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide to irreversible lead poisoning and the effects of methane gas to a hangover.", "\"The important thing to note,\" Pierrehumbert was quoted as saying in an online post for The New York Times, \"is that essentially all of the climate effects of methane emissions disappear within 20 years of cessation of emissions. In this sense, the climate harm caused by methane leakage is reversible. In contrast, CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, ratcheting up the temperature irreversibly, at least out to several millennia.\"", "In a different online Times post, Louis A. Derry, a Cornell colleague of Howarth\u2019s, and an associate professor in earth and academic sciences, was quoted as saying that between 2007 and 2011, the climate impact from increased carbon dioxide was 13 times greater than that of methane.", "\"For me, the picture is pretty clear,\" he wrote, \"Displacing coal emissions with gas emissions is beneficial from a climate standpoint.\"", "Another prominent climate expert, James Hansen of Columbia University, recently acknowledged that gas can serve as a temporary alternative to burning coal.", "Does this mean natural gas, including fracked gas, is better for climate than coal-burning?
