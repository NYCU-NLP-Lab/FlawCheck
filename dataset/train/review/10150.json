["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 18, 2020", "Posts on Facebook and Twitter suggest that former Vice President Joe Biden is responsible for taxes on Social Security, but those posts ignore the political history and mislead on the details. The posts also twist Biden\u2019s proposals on retirement contributions.", "A claim linking Joe Biden to Social Security taxes has been shared widely online, but it offers a misleading interpretation of how the taxes were established, Biden\u2019s role and the vice president\u2019s tax plan.", "Text posts shared on Facebook and Twitter \u2014 where actor and wellspring of dubious claims James Woods garnered more than 45,000 retweets \u2014 make this claim: \u201cPrior to 1983, social security was not taxable. Joe Biden voted successfully in favor of taxing 50% of social security. In 1993, Joe Biden was the deciding vote in raising taxes on social security from 50% to 85%. Now he wants to tax our 401k\u2019s and IRA\u2019s (page 78, Dems\u2019 platform)\u201d", "We\u2019ll address each of the three parts of that claim below.", "\u201cPrior to 1983, social security was not taxable. Joe Biden voted successfully in favor of taxing 50% of social security.\u201d", "That\u2019s not the whole story. Biden was one of 88 senators who voted for a bipartisan bill in 1983 to tax up to 50% of Social Security for beneficiaries with income above a certain threshold. That vote came at a time when the Social Security trust fund for retirement benefits was running out of money.", "In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan, with congressional leaders, convened a bipartisan commission to study the issue. In 1983, that commission issued a report that formed the basis for amendments to the Social Security program. Among the recommendations in the report was that benefits be taxed as income for recipients who had income over a certain threshold.", "Congress set that threshold a little higher than recommended, at $25,000 for single people and $32,000 for married couples. That would be equivalent to about $64,000 and $82,000 today, adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 consumer price index calculator.", "A Senate Finance Committee report issued in March 1983 said that the bill would assure that those with low incomes wouldn\u2019t pay taxes, but those with \u201csubstantial taxable income from other sources\u201d would be taxed on some of the benefits they receive.", "The income thresholds weren\u2019t indexed to inflation, though. So, as time went on, inflation would rise but the thresholds would remain the same, effectively lowering the bar that was intended to keep low-income beneficiaries from being taxed and adding more beneficiaries to the tax rolls.", "It should also be noted that the thresholds weren\u2019t a hard line above which everyone would be treated the same. Rather, the bill set out a formula with a gradual increase in the amount of benefits eligible to be taxed, which maxed out at half of a recipient\u2019s benefits.", "All of the taxes collected on those benefits would go back into the Social Security coffers.", "The bill that included that change to the program passed in a bipartisan vote in 1983. Biden was one of 88 senators who voted for it. Only nine senators voted against it.", "When Reagan signed the bill into law, he praised the bipartisan effort in his remarks and was joined by members of both parties. \u201cThis bill demonstrates for all time our nation\u2019s ironclad commitment to Social Security,\u201d he said.", "Today, about half of Social Security recipients pay no federal income tax on their benefits, according to a June 12 report from the Congressional Research Service. When the law was passed, about 10% of recipients owed taxes on their benefits. So, the portion of those affected has risen, although it\u2019s far from including everyone.", "So it\u2019s true that Biden voted to tax some Social Security benefits. But the social media posts leave out the fact that the law had overwhelming bipartisan support, wouldn\u2019t apply to all beneficiaries and would only tax 50% of benefits at the upper end of a sliding scale.", "\u201cIn 1993, Joe Biden was the deciding vote in raising taxes on social security from 50% to 85%.\u201d", "In this case, the change was part of a major tax bill that President Bill Clinton had laid out in his State of the Union address in February 1993.", "Among its provisions was an increase to the amount of Social Security benefits that could be taxed for some recipients. The way this claim is phrased, though, it sounds like the benefits are subject to an 85% tax rate. That\u2019s not right.", "This change to the Social Security program was structured similarly to the 1983 change. It added another bracket to the income thresholds and increased the portion of benefits eligible to be taxed if recipients exceeded the second-tier thresholds. Under this bill, single recipients with income over $34,000 and married couples making more than $44,000 could pay income tax on up to 85% of their Social Security benefits.", "The tax bill, which included several controversial changes, was highly partisan. Not a single Republican voted in favor of it.", "Biden voted for the bill, along with the majority of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.", "He wasn\u2019t the \u201cdeciding vote,\u201d though. The Senate vote was tied, 50-50, and Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote.", "We addressed another claim related to this issue when Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign pointed to Biden\u2019s vote on the 1993 bill. The Romney campaign had failed to mention, as do the current social media posts, that the additional tax revenue would go into the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund \u2014 which was rapidly depleting.", "So, it\u2019s true that Biden voted for an increase in the amount of Social Security benefits that could be taxed for some recipients, but it didn\u2019t apply to all recipients and he wasn\u2019t the \u201cdeciding vote.\u201d", "\u201cNow he wants to tax our 401k\u2019s and IRA\u2019s (page 78, Dems\u2019 platform).\u201d", "Neither the Democratic Party\u2019s platform, nor Biden\u2019s campaign website, calls for taxing retirement accounts. Rather, they refer to a proposal to equalize the tax incentive for contributions to such accounts, which would increase the tax break for lower-income individuals and decrease it for those with high incomes.", "An analysis of Biden\u2019s tax proposals conducted by the Tax Policy Center notes that his plan for retirement savings accounts is similar to an option laid out in a 2012 report from the AARP Public Policy Institute. Currently, contributions to 401(k) aren\u2019t taxed \u2014 only withdrawals. The AARP report proposed\u00a0a flat-rate credit instead of tax-free contributions, which are keyed to workers\u2019 tax brackets and benefit those with higher incomes.", "Explaining the effect of that policy, the report said, \u201cconsider two taxpayers, each of whom contributes $6,000 to a 401(k) and thus reduces taxable income by $6,000. One taxpayer has high income and faces a marginal tax rate of 35 percent; by contributing to the 401(k), she reduces taxes owed by $2,100 (35 percent of the $6,000 contribution). The other has relatively low income and is in the 10 percent tax bracket, so that the 401(k) contribution only reduces taxes by $600.\u201d", "In that example, the more well-off person gets a 35% government subsidy and the less well-off person gets a 10% government subsidy, since the subsidies are tied to their tax rates.", "If, instead, everyone who put money into a retirement account received a flat-rate credit \u2014 untethered from their tax rate \u2014 it would shift more of the subsidies to low- and middle-income workers.", "Using a roughly 28% credit as an example, the 2012 report found, \u201cTax increases would be concentrated in the top decile of the income distribution, while the bottom 90 percent of the distribution would receive, on net, a tax reduction.\u201d", "So, introducing a flat-rate that\u2019s lower than someone\u2019s tax rate \u2014 28% versus 35%, to use the examples above \u2014 could be cast as a tax increase since that person would be liable for the difference. But that person would still be able to put away money with an effectively lower tax rate than they\u2019d usually pay.", "Gordon Mermin, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center who worked on the analysis of Biden\u2019s tax proposals, said in an email to FactCheck.org, \u201cMy bottom line is that proposal increases retirement tax subsidies for low and middle income savers and reduces subsidies for certain higher income savers, but to be clear, everyone who contributes to an IRA or 401K still gets a tax break.\u201d", "The actual impact of the plan would depend on the details, and we didn\u2019t get a response from the Biden campaign when we asked. But it\u2019s misleading to say that Biden \u201cwants to tax our 401k\u2019s and IRA\u2019s\u201d without any further explanation. In fact, a flat tax credit would result in a larger tax break for lower-income individuals who contribute to retirement accounts.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
