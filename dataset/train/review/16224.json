Over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four Trump quotes asserting testing is making America look bad, so we should slow it down.", "Ads in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative.", "That didn\u2019t happen here.", "America has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world \u2014 with 2.3 million as of June 24, 2020 \u2014 and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers.

Throughout the pandemic the U.S. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia have all tested at a higher rate, and Russia and Qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people.", "Trump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying America\u2019s testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a \"badge of honor.\"", "But since May, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it \"overrated\" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts.

Of course, less testing would simply mean officials are aware of less cases, or there would be fewer identified cases \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t mean fewer cases exist.", "But this line of thinking is consistent with other comments from the president, including a May 15, 2020, event where Trump said, \"If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases,\" and \"Maybe it (testing) is overrated.\"", "These statements, used separately in the ad, are both from a June 20, 2020, rally in Oklahoma.", "The quote", "\"You know, testing is a double-edged sword. We\u2019ve tested now 25 million people. It\u2019s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. German\u2019s done a lot. South Korea\u2019s done a lot. They called me, they said the job you\u2019re doing (trails off). Here\u2019s the bad part.
