["About this rating", "On 8 December 2015, the hashtag #TrumpIsDisqualifiedParty started trending on Twitter, referencing the notion that GOP candidate Donald Trump had been \"disqualified\" from running for President due to comments he made suggesting that Muslims should be banned from entering the U.S.:", "While many people used the hashtag to celebrate\u00a0Trump's supposed disqualification from the Presidential race, those tweets did not signal an official proclamation that\u00a0Trump had been disqualified from running for President over having violated some necessary condition.
