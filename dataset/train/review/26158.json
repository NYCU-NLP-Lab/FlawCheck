["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on January 18, 2018", "President Donald Trump\u2019s approval ratings among African Americans have declined, not \u201cdoubled,\u201d as the president claimed in a recent tweet.", "The source of Trump\u2019s boast appears to be a misreading of data from the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Weekly surveys conducted by that organization show that his approval rating among black Americans has declined from 23 percent between Jan. 26 and Jan. 30, 2017, to\u00a017 percent between Dec. 28, 2017, and Jan. 3, 2018. Polling by the Pew Research Center and Gallup show declines over a similar period, too.", "Trump made the claim about improved approval ratings in a Jan. 16 tweet that came just days after Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said Trump referred to African nations as \u201cshitholes\u201d during a Jan. 11 White House meeting on immigration.", "Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you, and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2018", "Trump is correct that the unemployment rate for blacks is the lowest it has been going back to 1972, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. When Trump took office in January, the rate was 7.8 percent \u2013 the lowest in nearly 10 years. It was 6.8 percent in December, the lowest on record.", "That 1 percentage point decrease continues a trend for the past several years. There was a similar drop in 2016, and there were even larger decreases in 2013, 2014 and 2015.", "The White House did not respond to our request for evidence that Trump\u2019s approval among blacks has \u201cdoubled.\u201d And we didn\u2019t find support for it, either.", "As other news organizations have pointed out, Trump\u2019s tweet may have been based on a segment on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d a morning TV program the president watches regularly. After all, he included the Fox News Twitter handle at the end of his tweet.", "On the Jan. 16 edition of the show, co-host Brian Kilmeade made this claim during a segment about negative news coverage of Trump: \u201cBelieve it or not, through all this negative coverage, they did a survey of 600,000 people about how black America views this president. His numbers have actually doubled in approval.\u201d", "Kilmeade didn\u2019t offer a source for his statement, but it sounded similar to something reported two days earlier by the conservative Breitbart website.", "That article \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Support Among Blacks Has Doubled Since 2016, Amid Racism Claims\u201d \u2014 included this explanation:", "Breitbart, Jan. 14: Among black men, Trump\u2019s \u201c2017 average approval rating significantly exceeds his 2016 vote share,\u201d admitted a January\u00a011 article in the Atlantic\u00a0by author\u00a0Ronald Brownstein.\u00a0\u201c23 percent of black men approved of Trump\u2019s performance versus 11 percent of black women,\u201d said the article.", "That score averages out to 17 percent, or twice the 8 percent score he was given in the 2016 exit polls.", "But Kilmeade and Breitbart both misrepresented SurveyMonkey\u2019s findings.", "The polling organization conducted over 600,000 interviews with Americans of all races in 2017, not just black Americans, as Kilmeade suggested. And, as we mentioned, its publicly available data show that Trump\u2019s approval rating among blacks dropped from 23 percent very early in his presidency to around 17 percent as of the seven days ending Jan. 3, 2018.", "It\u2019s true that the Atlantic reported that 23 percent of black men and 11 percent of black women approved of Trump\u2019s job performance in 2017, based on figures SurveyMoney provided to the magazine. But it\u2019s not correct to just add those two figures together to produce an average, as Breitbart did. In fact, the New York Times reported that SurveyMonkey didn\u2019t even interview the same number of men and women.", "It\u2019s also wrong to compare those approval ratings to exit poll data from the 2016 general election to claim that Trump\u2019s \u201csupport among blacks has doubled.\u201d The figures don\u2019t make for a useful comparison because they measure two different things.", "The exit poll data show the percentage of black voters who preferred Trump to his presidential rivals, and the 2017 survey data show the percentage of black Americans \u2014 some voters and some not \u2014 who approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president.", "Even if the latter percentage is twice as much as the former, that does not mean that Trump\u2019s approval rating has doubled.", "Data from Gallup show that his approval among blacks declined from 15 percent between Jan. 20 and Jan. 29, 2017, to 6 percent between Dec. 25 and Dec. 31, 2017. And data from the Pew Research Center show that Trump\u2019s approval in that demographic dropped 7 percentage points in 2017 \u2014 from 14 percent in February to 7 percent in December.", "That\u2019s in addition to the SurveyMonkey data that also show a decline.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
