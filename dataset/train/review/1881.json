Noah Berger / AP Photo", "In his first tweet about this summer\u2019s California wildfires, President Trump blamed environmental laws for making the blazes worse by preventing firefighters from using a \"massive amount of readily available water.\"", "He said it\u2019s \"being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.\"", "The problem with that claim? The state\u2019s firefighting agency said it\u2019s had no complications accessing water, while fire experts said the state\u2019s hot, dry and windy conditions are to blame for the infernos, not any water policy.", "Here\u2019s what Trump tweeted on Aug. 5, 2018:", "With blazes continuing to ravage the state, we set out on a fact check. We focused on the first portion of the tweet about water policy.", "Our research", "Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told us, it\u2019s the hot and dry conditions taking place earlier in the year that are leading to the extreme fires.", "\"We have had no issues accessing water to fight the fires,\" McLean wrote in an email. \"This year\u2019s changing weather pattern is leading to more severe and destructive wildfires.\"", "Keith Gilless is a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection.", "He said he believes Trump is conflating two very different issues. There\u2019s long been a conflict between farmers and environmental groups over how much water should go to crops versus rivers and lakes. But that fight hasn\u2019t had any effect on firefighting.", "\"I think there\u2019s some real confusion in the tweet,\" Gilless said. \"The issues over the allocation of water between environmental and agricultural interests have nothing to do with firefighting. And I\u2019m not aware of any situation in which those conflicts have restricted the availability of water for firefighting purposes.\"", "Heat, dry conditions blamed for fires", "Gilless said the reason California\u2019s wildfires are so destructive this year is the state\u2019s \"high heat, low relative humidity, high wind speeds and high fuel loading.\" He said climate change is making these conditions more frequent.", "\"California is going through a really heartbreaking fire season right now,\" he added. \"Environmental laws about water have nothing to do with it from my perspective.\"", "Gilless said Trump\u2019s language about water \"being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,\" doesn\u2019t make sense, as water naturally flows to the ocean. The argument about how much water should be captured before it gets to the ocean, again, is part of a different, unrelated debate.", "The second portion of Trump\u2019s tweet, that California \"Must also tree clear to stop fire \u00a0spreading!\", is also confusing. Forestry experts say thinning trees is a well-established practice that can reduce the severity of fires. But clearing trees is more commonly associated with commercial logging practices, not fire management.", "Leroy Westerling, a UC Merced professor and wildfire specialist, told\u00a0the San Francisco Chronicle that Trump\u2019s tweet, \"On the water side, it boggles the mind.\"", "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence to support Trump\u2019s tweet.", "A day before the tweet, the Trump administration approved\u00a0California's request to declare a\u00a0\"major disaster\" as the state continues to fight wildfires that have claimed at least nine lives. The declaration makes federal funds available to residents of Shasta County, where the Carr Fire outside Redding, California, has destroyed more than 1,000 homes.", "Our rating", "President Trump claimed in a tweet that California\u2019s wildfires are \"made so much worse by the bad environmental laws\" which prevent firefighters from accessing water. He added in the tweet that water \"is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.\"", "Trump appears to have conflated the state\u2019s real water controversy between farmers and environmentalists with the unrelated issue of firefighting. The state\u2019s fire agency, CalFire, said it has not had problems accessing water. And fire experts said it\u2019s the state\u2019s hot and bone-dry conditions, not environmental laws, that are making blazes more extreme.", "We rated Trump\u2019s claim False.", "FALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.", "Click here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "President Trump, tweet, Aug. 5, 2018", "Scott McLean, spokesman, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, email exchange Aug. 6, 2018", "Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, email exchange Aug. 6, 2018", "Keith Gilless, UC Berkeley professor of forestry economics, phone interview, Aug. 6, 2018", "San Francisco Chronicle, Trump tweet blaming water diversion for fires baffles experts, Aug. 5, 2018", "Marketwatch, Trump wrongly blames California\u2019s worsening wildfires on water diversions, Aug. 6, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
