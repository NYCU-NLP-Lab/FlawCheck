["A Facebook post claiming the anti-parasite drug ivermectin has been \u201cofficially recommended\u201d by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to treat Covid-19 in the US\u00a0has been shared more than 100 times in South Africa. The claim\u00a0 is false; the NIH confirmed to AFP Fact Check that there is not yet enough data to \u201crecommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19\u201d in the US. Furthermore, it is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that approves drugs in the US, not the NIH.", "\u201cIvertmectin (sic) is now OFFICIALLY recommended by the NHI (sic) in the US for treatment of Covid-19,\u201d reads a post published on January 21, 2021 by an account in the name of South African politician Vytjie Mentor. \u201cWhat is the South African government \u2026\u00a0 waiting for?\u201d", "As is the case with numerous politicians\u2019 pages in South Africa, the widely-followed Facebook account in Mentor's name has not been verified with a blue tick. Multiple attempts to confirm with Mentor that it indeed belongs to her have gone unanswered. AFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims posted by this account\u00a0here and here.", "This post includes a link to a report by the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), a non-profit organisation set up by health care specialists who recently claimed the NIH had effectively recommended the drug for Covid-19 patients after they presented it with compelling data.", "Similar posts shared on Facebook here and here in South Africa also claimed that the NIH had \u201cupgraded\u201d its stance on ivermectin, based on assertions made in the same FLCCC article, thereby clearing the way for its use as a Covid-19 therapy in the US.", "However, the claim that the NIH has officially recommended the drug for use against Covid-19 is false.", "Ivermectin is a medication used to treat parasitic infections. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised ivermectin tablets to treat parasitic worms, and creams and lotions for infections, including head lice and rosacea, but not for use in Covid-19 patients.", "As of January 2021, there is still not enough scientific evidence supporting the use of\u00a0ivermectin in the fight against Covid-19, according to the NIH.", "Although the NIH updated its position on ivermectin in a statement issued on January 14, it ultimately determined that there was \u201cinsufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19\u201d, adding that further guidance on the drug\u2019s efficacy will require \u201cadequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials\u201d.", "To date, said the NIH in its statement, \u201cmost of the studies ... had incomplete information and significant methodological limitations\u201d, meaning experts were unable to draw definitive conclusions.", "In its report here, the FLCCC noted that the NIH is neither \u201cfor or against\u201d administering ivermectin to Covid-19 patients.", "However, the authors interpreted this as a tacit sign of approval by the NIH because the institute had changed its previous recommendation advising \u201cagainst\u201d ivermectin to a more neutral stance\u00a0\u2014\u00a0despite the fact that the FDA has not approved the drug for use to treat Covid-19.", "\u201cBy no longer recommending against ivermectin use, doctors should feel more open in prescribing ivermectin as another therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19,\u201d wrote the FLCCC authors. \u201cThis may clear its path towards FDA emergency use approval.\u201d", "When contacted by AFP Fact Check, Hillary Hoffman, a spokesperson for the National Institution of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) \u2013 the branch of the NIH charged with publishing information related to Covid-19 \u2013 affirmed that the NIH recommends neither for nor against using ivermectin to fight the disease.", "The FDA\u2019s view, on the other hand, remains unchanged; its last update on the issue published here on December 16, 2020, reiterates that ivermectin has not been approved to treat or prevent infections from the novel coronavirus. \u201cAdditional testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be appropriate to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19,\u201d the organisation said on its Frequently Asked Questions page. The FDA's office of media affairs confirmed with AFP Fact Check on January 27, 2021\u00a0that this remained the organisation's stance.", "Meanwhile, South Africa\u2019s health products regulatory authority, which also oversees clinical trials, tweeted on January 27, 2021, that it was open to the use of ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19 through a \u201ccompassionate and controlled\u201d access programme, the guidelines for which would follow in due course.", "SAHPRA will engage with medical professionals to deliver a compassionate and controlled access programme. A guideline will be published shortly", "AFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims calling ivermectin a \u201cmiracle drug\u201d capable of curing Covid-19.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
