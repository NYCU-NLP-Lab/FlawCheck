["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 4, 2020", "Viral posts are spreading a false claim that a photograph shows Rep. Adam Schiff with the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d The photo was posted by Schiff and shows his family and his daughter\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 who is a college student, not an intelligence official.", "As the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump nears its end, social media users have resurfaced a false claim attempting to depict a family tie between Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and the whistleblower whose complaint led to the impeachment.", "The meme now circulating makes the baseless claim that a young man seen in a photo with Schiff\u2019s family is the \u201c\u2018whistleblower\u2019 aka Schiffs daughters boyfriend.\u201d Schiff is chairman of the House intelligence committee and the lead manager prosecuting the impeachment case before the Senate.", "The person in the photo was identified by Schiff \u2014 in public social media posts \u2014 as his daughter\u2019s boyfriend. But there\u2019s no basis for the claim that he\u2019s the whistleblower, a member of the intelligence community who anonymously filed a complaint regarding Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "Schiff shared the photo in question on his verified Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts in November with the message: \u201cHappy Thanksgiving from my family to yours! With Eve, Alexa and her boyfriend Eric.\u201d", "The individual in the photo is actually an undergraduate college student studying mathematics, FactCheck.org confirmed, not a government official.", "The whistleblower\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been publicly confirmed, but some outlets have identified an intelligence official by the same first name who is alleged to be the whistleblower \u2014 which has evidently fueled the falsehood. That official is not the same person shown in the photo.", "The dubious claim about Schiff\u2019s daughter\u2019s boyfriend appeared almost immediately as an apparent joke after Schiff posted the photo in November. A website called \u201cGenesius Times\u201d \u2014 which bills itself as the \u201cMOST RELIABLE SOURCE OF FAKE NEWS ON THE PLANET\u201d \u2014 also parroted the claim, editing a screenshot of Schiff\u2019s actual tweet to make it read: \u201cher boyfriend \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 Eric.'\u201d", "As the memes have spread in recent days, another publication that claims its work is satire \u2014 but whose content often serves as the of source of misinformation \u2014 also published a headline on Jan. 31 claiming that \u201cAdam Schiff\u2019s Daughter is Dating the Whistleblower.\u201d", "Previous social media hoaxes have also wrongly alleged to show photos of the whistleblower, including some with high-profile Democrats.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, whistleblowers are permitted under federal law to anonymously report alleged wrongdoings to inspectors general, Congress and other appropriate authorities. While the law only bars inspectors general and their staffs from disclosing the identity of a whistleblower, there are other legal considerations for not naming the complainant \u2014 it could, for example, obstruct a congressional investigation or lead to retaliation against the federal employee.", "Schiff and others have worked to protect the identity of the whistleblower. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican appointee to the court, refused to read a question during the impeachment trial that was submitted by Republican Sen. Rand Paul that included the name of the alleged whistleblower.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
