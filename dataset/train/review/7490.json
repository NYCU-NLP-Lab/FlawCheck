The original poster of the image was asked for citations and asserted that the quote had been verified by \"fact check\" but provided no links to any such verification:", "Separate postings of the image included comments to the same effect, that no one who had attempted to authenticate the quote had been successful in doing so:", "Although a number of social media users supportive of the protests attempted to ascertain the quote's validity  (and opined that it looked implausible as presented), none of them was able to produce evidence the comments were authentic. Some users also shared a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Warren, which appeared to be fake and had emerged well after the protests were underway. Some commenters cited various sources (a conference call, an unspecified publication, articles that did not include the purported quote), but none of them checked out as a credible or related source.", "Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to our request for comment.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
