["One lawmaker claims Jon Corzine made history this week on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut not by choice.\n\nThe Senate Agriculture Committee voted to compel Corzine, a former senator and governor of New Jersey, to testify Tuesday about the collapse of MF Global, the investment firm he headed. Sen. Pat Roberts, the committee\u2019s ranking member, said subpoenaing Corzine was an unprecedented measure.\n\n\"It's the first time, I think, in history where a former senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues,\" Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said in an interview on Fox Business News on Dec. 6, when the Senate committee voted to compel Corzine to testify.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s vote, Roberts said that \"based on consultations with the Senate historian\u2019s office, it is also unclear if any former member of the Senate has been compelled to testify before a Senate committee. It is our understanding that such action could be a first.\"\n\nWe checked with the Senate historian\u2019s office and found that, as far as they know, Roberts is right.\n\nFormer senators have been forced to testify before a House committee, but Corzine is the first former senator known to be subpoenaed by a Senate committee.\n\nCorzine served as the chairman and CEO of MF Global, which went bankrupt this fall. During the company\u2019s collapse, as much as $1.2 billion in client money disappeared.\n\nKatherine Scott, an assistant historian at the U.S. Senate Historical Office, noted limits to definitively identifying former senators subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees. \"Subpoena documents are kept with committee files at the National Archives. Hearing transcripts were not methodically collected prior to the early 20th century,\" she said in an email.\n\nHowever, the Senate historian\u2019s office found one instance where two former senators were forced to testify before a House committee.\n\nIn 1908, \u00a0Matthew Butler of South Carolina and Marion Butler of North Carolina were subpoenaed and testified before a House committee investigating the lobbying tactics of the Electric Boat Company of New Jersey and their predecessors, the Holland Boat Company.\n\nThe two former senators, who were not related, denied any wrongdoing in their work with the companies, which built submarines, and no charges were brought against the former lawmakers.\n\nSo that\u2019s an example of former senators being forced to testify before a House committee. But as far as the U.S. Senate Historical Office knows, Corzine is the first senator subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee.\n\nBut Terry Madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania, said Corzine won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\"The Senate to be sure is very precedent driven--so once this precedent has been established, you can bet it won't be the last time it will happen,\" he said. But he also noted that the MF Global issue is \"unusually salient because of the heightened interest in the actions of the investment community in general and Wall Street in particular.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRoberts claimed that Jon Corzine is the first former senator to be \"subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues.\"\n\nCorzine is the first senator to be compelled to testify before Congress in more than 100 years. And as far as Senate historian\u2019s office knows, he\u2019s the first to be subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee.\n\nBased on that information, we rate Roberts\u2019 statement True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "YouTube, Roberts Talks MF Global, Corzine Subpoena on FOX Biz News, posted Dec. 7, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Katherine Scott, assistant historian for the U.S. Senate Historical Office, Dec. 8 - 13, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Sarah Little, communications director for U.S. Sen.
