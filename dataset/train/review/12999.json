By email, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford advised that Adler relied on a Texas Monthly \"Daily Post\" story on FBI crime statistics published the day that Adler tweeted.", "The story includes a headline declaring Austin the state\u2019s safest city. In the main, the story says that according to data compiled by the FBI covering 2015 and part of 2016, Odessa by far had the state\u2019s highest violent crime rate, 1,070.1 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents, up 25 percent from 2014. The FBI classifies as violent crimes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.", "\"It\u2019s long been noted that Austin is something of a fairytale land where violence is rare, and at least compared to the rest of the state, that tends to bear out,\" the story says, going on: \"Although Austin\u2019s violent crime rate of 287.7 per 100,000 is slightly up from 2013, it\u2019s grown at a much slower rate than any comparably safe city over the past couple of years, putting Austin in the top spot for safe Texas cities.\"", "FBI says don\u2019t compare jurisdictions", "We noticed, though, the story didn\u2019t mention a consistent FBI advisory against employing its statistics to compare jurisdictions.", "Since at least 2011, the FBI has said it \"strongly discourages\" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to compare communities. That note said: \"Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale.\" The FBI admonished in May 2017: \"Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place.\"", "When we asked FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer to evaluate Adler\u2019s claim, Fischer replied by email: \"Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking the agencies and using the data as a measurement of law enforcement effectiveness.\" Fischer passed along elaboration from FBI analyst Loretta Simmons: \"Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction.\"", "Austin, big city?", "Another consideration is whether Austin fairly ranks as a big city in comparison to, say, Houston, Dallas or San Antonio.", "This year, before rating Half True U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s description of his hometown as the nation\u2019s safest city, we noted that CQ Press--which annually reports on crime rates using FBI statistics--enables adjustments based on population density--and if you impose a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile, Austin and El Paso fall out of its big-city crime rate rankings. That density squeeze, we found, left San Antonio with the No. 6 lowest crime rate nationally, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17.", "Austin region\u2019s violent crime rate", "Another wrinkle: The crime rates cited by Texas Monthly were not city-specific, instead taking into account metropolitan statistical areas.

Austin\u2019s rate of 287.7 violent crimes per 100,000 residents greatly trailed the Odessa area\u2019s No. 1 state rate of 1070.1 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Meantime, the Austin region\u2019s murder/nonnegligent manslaughter rate of 2.2 per 100,000 residents ranked third behind the rates for less-populous Wichita Falls (1.3 per 100,000 residents) and Brownsville (1.6 per 100,000 residents); the Longview area had the state\u2019s highest rate (10.1 per 100,000 inhabitants).", "LOWEST VIOLENT CRIME RATES, TEXAS METRO AREAS, 2015", "REGION", "VIOLENT CRIME RATE", "Austin-Round Rock", "287.7 per 100,000 residents", "Tyler", "295.7", "College Station-Bryan", "315.5", "McAllen-Edinburg-Mission", "298.1", "Brownsville-Harlingen", "299.8", "Midland", "322.3", "Sherman-Denison", "327.1", "San Angelo", "329.3", "Dallas-Plano-Irving", "330.6", "Wichita Falls", "334.5", "More recent FBI data", "Our own look into FBI crime reports further showed that in January 2017, the agency released its preliminary report tabulating crimes in each U.S. city of 100,000 population or greater in the first half of 2016.", "From those figures, we roughed out the violent crime rate for each of 35 Texas cities (not metro areas) listed in the report. Our finding: Austin (population about 948,000 as of July 2016) ranked 21st in the state with a violent-crime rate of 209 incidents per 100,000 residents--trailing cities including El Paso (population about 683,000) with 195 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants); Laredo (192 violent crimes per 100,000 residents); Midland (186 violent crimes per 100,000 people); and the capital\u2019s northern suburb, Round Rock (73 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants).

Among Texas cities Fox evaluated, Houston had the highest homicide rate, 13.3 per 100,000 residents.", "Does that arguably make Austin the safest big city in Texas? Fox said by phone that such judgments are hard to cement because cities differ in many ways including, for instance, how suburban they happen to be. \"There are a whole bunch of reasons cities differ that have nothing to do with safety,\" Fox said, \"that have nothing to do with police and how they\u2019re doing their job.
