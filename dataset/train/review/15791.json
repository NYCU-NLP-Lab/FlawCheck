Bowe Bergdahl, liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow is trying to defend the prisoner exchange by comparing it to the rescue of Iraq POW Jessica Lynch.", "On her June 3, 2014, show, Maddow explained Lynch\u2019s story -- how her convoy had taken wrong turns in Nasiriyah, Iraq, in 2003 and was ambushed. And Maddow cited dramatic details in a Washington Post report that Lynch \"fought fiercely and shot several enemy soldiers after Iraqi forces ambushed the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company, firing her weapon until she ran out of ammunition.\"", "But Lynch has since said that description is incorrect, saying her gun jammed in the chaos.", "Maddow highlighted the navigational mistakes of U.S. troops and the inaccurate story of Lynch\u2019s heroics to draw a comparison to Bergdahl.", "\"If the heroics that the Pentagon made up about her (Lynch) didn't really happen, and they didn\u2019t, maybe the U.S. special forces who rescued her and the other Americans \u2026 maybe they shouldn\u2019t have bothered,\" Maddow said, sarcastically. \"After all, maybe it was sort of their own screw up that got them ambushed and hurt and captured in the first place. Is that how we think about these things now?\"", "Some people who saw Maddow\u2019s reporting questioned her assertion that \"the Pentagon made up\" Lynch\u2019s heroism. The Pentagon is the building that houses the U.S. Defense Department and a\u00a0quasi-official way to reference the Defense Department. Saying the Pentagon \"made up\" something is the equivalent of accusing George W. Bush's Defense Department.", "We decided to dig into Maddow's\u00a0claim further.

But doctors found no evidence of either.", "Lynch \"was fighting to the death,\" a U.S. official told the Post, and she killed several Iraqis. But Lynch\u2019s weaponed was jammed, and she killed no Iraqis.", "The Post reporting became the genesis \"of a spate of stories that accepted the Post sequence of events,\" journalist Dante Chinni, who researched the issue, wrote for the Pew Research Journalism Project. \"Many articles focused on the Rambo-like firefight Lynch reportedly engaged in \u2014 some even cited her valiant fighting as proof that women belonged in combat zones.\"", "Within a few weeks, however, the story had all but fallen apart.", "Chinni provides a good timeline:", "April 15, 2003: The Washington Post runs a piece questioning its earlier account.

(The Lynch talk starts about 30 minutes in.)", "Loeb described his sources as \"some really good intelligence sources here in Washington.\" He said that after the information was proven to be false, the Post went back to reconstruct what happened. They found that the intelligence was coming from the battlefield and that U.S. officials had picked up on Iraqi \"intercepts talking about a blind American firing back.\"", "Intelligence officials, who could include a number of people working at a host of different agencies, interpreted that blind American to be Lynch.", "Loeb was asked if he thought he was given the reports as part of an effort to mythologize Lynch.", "\"No not at all,\" said Loeb, who is now managing editor of the Houston Chronicle. \"I\u2019ve been asked this over and over again. Our sources for that story were not Pentagon sources. In fact, I could not get anybody from the Pentagon to talk about those reports at all. I got indications that they had in fact received those intelligence reports, but the Pentagon was completely unwilling to comment on those reports at all. They wouldn\u2019t say anything about Jessica Lynch.", "\"I\u2019ve never believed that, as least as the story we wrote goes, that it was a Pentagon attempt to create a hero there,\" Loeb said.

That may be a popular opinion, but Maddow missed on the details of Lynch\u2019s now-debunked story.", "First, the original report Maddow pointed to -- an article in the Washington Post --\u00a0specifically said that\u00a0the Pentagon couldn\u2019t confirm the story.", "And later, the author of the Post\u00a0report made clear that his source was not the Pentagon.
