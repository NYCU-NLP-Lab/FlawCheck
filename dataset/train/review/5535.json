["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 20, 2016", "In the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that her proposals would \u201cnot add a penny to the debt.\u201d But a nonpartisan budget watchdog group estimates that what she has detailed thus far would add $200 billion to the debt over 10 years.", "The same budget experts estimate Trump\u2019s proposals would add significantly more \u2014 $5.3 trillion \u2014 to the debt over 10 years. Clinton, however, made the misleading claim that Trump\u2019s tax cuts would \u201cadd $20 trillion to the debt.\u201d That\u2019s a two-decade figure \u2014 a point Clinton leaves out \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t account for any spending cuts Trump has proposed.", "And these budget estimates are on top of the $9 trillion growth in the federal debt projected under current law over the next decade.", "The Democratic nominee made the disputed boast about her plans a few times during the debate, telling moderator Chris Wallace at one point: \u201cBut if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\u2019m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt.\u201d And in one instance, she drew the misleading comparison to Trump\u2019s tax plan.", "Clinton, Oct. 19:\u00a0I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.", "This isn\u2019t the first time Clinton has claimed she would pay for all of her initiatives, and as we\u2019ve said before, we can\u2019t predict the future, of course. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has analyzed both of the candidates\u2019 spending and revenue proposals, finding that neither pays for everything they\u2019ve put forth.", "It\u2019s true that Clinton comes a lot closer to paying for her spending proposals than Trump does in covering his tax cuts, according to the CRFB analysis, but she would add well more than a penny to the debt\u00a0under what she has detailed thus far.\u00a0CRFB estimates, updated as of Sept. 21, found that Clinton\u2019s plans \u201cwould increase the debt by $200 billion over a decade above current law levels.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposals \u201cwould increase the debt by $5.3 trillion.\u201d", "Those numbers include \u201crough and preliminary estimates\u201d of new policies that the candidates announced after CRFB did its initial report in June, when it had calculated higher debt-increasing numbers for both Clinton and Trump.", "The group, which was founded by a former Democratic and a former Republican lawmaker in 1981, wrote that Clinton could pay for all of her proposals, and even cause a \u201cmodest deficit reduction,\u201d if she released details on her business tax changes that she says would cover her infrastructure plan. CRFB said that Clinton could generate $275 billion over 10 years, enough to make up her gap, through a business tax plan, but the campaign hasn\u2019t provided specifics on that proposal.", "As for the comparison to her opponent, Clinton could have cited CRFB\u2019s sizable $5.3 trillion estimate for what Trump\u2019s proposals would do to increase the debt over a decade \u2014 but she went much further than that, claiming a $20 trillion increase, nearly four times what the CRFB\u2019s budget experts estimated. Where did she get her figure? The $20 trillion figure is an estimate for what Trump\u2019s tax plan alone would add to the debt, including interest costs, over 20 years.", "It comes from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which said in its Oct. 18 report on Trump\u2019s revised tax plan: \u201cFederal revenues would fall by $6.2 trillion over the first decade before accounting for added interest costs and macroeconomic effects. Including those factors, the federal debt would rise by at least $7.0 trillion over the first decade and by at least $20.7 trillion by 2036.\u201d", "That analysis is only of Trump\u2019s tax plan. Although Trump\u2019s spending cuts are far from sufficient to pay for his tax cuts, according to CRFB\u2019s analysis, he has proposed a spending reduction of $1.2 trillion net over a decade.", "Clinton\u2019s tax plan, meanwhile, would reduce the federal debt. The Tax Policy Center found that her plan \u201cwould increase revenue by $1.4 trillion over the next decade,\u00a0before accounting for\u00a0reduced\u00a0interest\u00a0costs\u00a0and macroeconomic effects.\u00a0Including\u00a0those factors, the federal debt would\u00a0be reduced\u00a0by\u00a0at least\u00a0$1.5\u00a0trillion over\u00a0the first decade and by\u00a0at least\u00a0$5.4\u00a0trillion by\u00a02036.\u201d", "But, as CRFB has explained, Clinton has proposed several spending initiatives as well. And as we said,\u00a0CRFB\u2019s\u00a0estimates are on top of what projections show would happen under current law \u2014 which is a $9 trillion increase in the debt over 10 years.", "So even if Clinton is able to pay for all of her plans, the debt would still increase by trillions over the next decade without additional budget maneuvers to change that.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/06d346e4-f186-4e96-81c9-48fa60a2471a", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
