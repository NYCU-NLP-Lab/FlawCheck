Sanchez is an Orange County congresswoman. They are competing to replace retiring U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats.", "One claim by Harris on Sanchez\u2019s Capitol Hill tenure stood out:", "\"My opponent has passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office.\"", "We decided to check this provocative claim, and whether any context was missing.", "Our research", "To back up the statement, Harris\u2019 campaign pointed to Sanchez\u2019 record at congress.gov, the official website for\u00a0federal legislative information.", "It shows Sanchez has, indeed, sponsored only one bill that became law: A 2001 measure to rename an Orange County Post Office.", "It also shows Sanchez has co-sponsored 179 bills that have become law. Bills are often co-sponsored by dozens of members of Congress at the same time.", "Sanchez responded during the debate:", "\"It\u2019s pretty obvious to me that my opponent doesn\u2019t understand the Congress at all,\" Sanchez said. \"You don't pass a bill on its own necessarily in the Congress; you pass it by putting it into bills.\"", "Sanchez has a point: A search on congress.gov shows some of her colleagues, even some who have served longer than Sanchez, have introduced only a handful of bills that became law.
