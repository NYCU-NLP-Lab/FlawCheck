Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.", "In September 2020, Snopes readers began asking about a video supposedly showing a \"Biden Muslim ad\" shared on social media and often accompanied by misleading information. For example, some social media users falsely claimed that this ad was created by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign team. Others falsely claimed that the Biden campaign was only showing this ad to Muslims and the general public was only made aware of the footage after it \"leaked.\" Others falsely claimed that the Biden campaign created this ad courting Muslim voters but had not done the same for Christians. Others, still, just seemed offended that a presidential candidate would appeal to Muslim voters.", "Here's the video in question:", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2iL0uy6iL8&feature=youtu.be", "This is not an official campaign ad created, endorsed, or shared by the Biden campaign.", "This video primarily uses footage from a speech Biden delivered at the Million Muslim Votes Summit, an online conference hosted by a Muslim American political group called Emgage Action, in July 2020.
