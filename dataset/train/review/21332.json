About 120,000 people (including many who were native-born U.S. citizens) were placed in internment camps. Some were detained for up to four years in remote camps surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards.", "The United States did not formally apologize for the internment camps until 1988, when President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, which said the World War II actions toward Japanese Americans \"were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\"", "\"The experience of mass imprisonment devastated the Japanese American community,\" said Eric L.
