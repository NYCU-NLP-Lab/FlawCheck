It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate,\" he wrote.", "According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Florida\u00a0one of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination.", "Our ruling", "Aiken tweeted, \"A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.\"", "That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law.\u00a0However, 19 Florida\u00a0cities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections.", "We rate Aiken\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e41f675-9288-4071-bbb7-5510906aa369", "American Civil Liberties Union, \"Non-Discrimination Laws: State by State,\" undated, accessed June 18, 2016", "National Public Radio, \"Did You Know It's Legal In Most States To Discriminate Against LGBT People?\" April 28, 2015, updated March 24, 2016.", "Florida Legislature website, \"Title XLIV, Civil Rights, Chapter 760, Discrimination in the Treatment of Persons: Minority Representation,\" \"SB 120 - Prohibited Discrimination,\" and \"HB 45 - Prohibited Discrimination,\" all accessed June 18, 2016", "The Human Rights Campaign, \"Cities and Counties with Non-Discrimination Ordinances that Include Gender Identity,\" \u00a0Jan.28, 2016, accessed June 18, 2016", "Email, Frank Penela, communications director, Florida Commission on Human Relations, June 16, 2016", "Email, Josh Pultz, spokesman for Clay Aiken, June 16, 2016", "The Atlantic, \"Can States Protect LGBT Rights Without Compromising Religious Freedom?\" Jan. 6, 2016", "USA Today, \"Employment discrimination: The next frontier for LGBT community,\" Aug. 1, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
