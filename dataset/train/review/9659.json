["The TV network\u00a0published an investigation on November 12,\u00a0claiming it\u00a0had identified a man whose body fell from\u00a0the landing gear compartment\u00a0of a Kenya Airways flight from Nairobi to London's Heathrow airport\u00a0on June 30, 2019.", "As\u00a0AFP reported\u00a0at the time, neighbours said they heard a loud thud when the man's body -- described as an \"ice block\" -- landed next to a man sunbathing in his garden in Clapham, southwest London.", "Sky News\u00a0said the man was Paul Manyasi, a cleaner at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi who had smuggled himself on board.", "While the network has withdrawn the report from its website, a copy of the video version\u00a0can still be found on YouTube -- we've\u00a0archived it here.", "The investigation was based on testimony from\u00a0a woman named Irene, who claimed she worked with and was dating the man identified as Paul Manyasi. She\u00a0told Sky\u00a0journalist John Sparks that her boyfriend had gone missing \u201cat the end of June\u201d.", "Irene, whose identity was concealed by Sky News, also mentioned that a supervisor at work\u00a0told employees that there was \"somebody missing\".", "\"We were at work in the morning, then he suddenly disappeared. Nobody knows where he went. I called his phone. It was off. The following day, the supervisor called us and told us, there's\u00a0somebody missing but we are not sure of the person, so we keep it a secret until we know the person,\" Irene was quoted by Sky News as saying.", "\"Somebody missing\"", "Sky News has taken down\u00a0the investigation from its website, but like the video the written report had featured\u00a0photographs showing the man identified by Irene as Paul Manyasi.", "The report also featured\u00a0an interview with the parents of 'Paul', who said they were\u00a0worried about their son and that \"his phone isn't working\". They appeared to confirm that a bag and shoes in\u00a0photographs provided by London's Met Police belonged to their son.", "However, doubts about Sky News' claims\u00a0surfaced\u00a0when online users began pointing out that the photographs which allegedly showed 'Paul Manyasi' in Sky's report (below left)\u00a0were found on the Facebook profile of\u00a0a man called Cedrick Junior (below right), who is listed as living in Nairobi.", "Cedrick Junior\u2019s profile\u00a0lists a Facebook user called\u00a0Elivas Lumeti as his cousin. Contacted\u00a0by AFP, Elivas Lumeti confirmed that she was Cedrick Junior's cousin. She said that his name was actually\u00a0Cedric Isaac Shivonje and that he\u00a0had been arrested in August, 2019.", "Lumeti said\u00a0that there was nobody called Paul Manyasi in the family.", "\u201cI am his cousin but he is in Kamiti prison, still alive. In our family there is no name like that,\u201d she told AFP via WhatsApp.", "Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation managed to speak to Cedric Isaac Shivonje in prison. In an interview published on November 20, 2019, he describes seeing his photographs on TV.", "\"We were watching the news, then my friends, they all start telling me, 'hey, are those your pictures?\" Then, automatically, I saw them. They were mine,\" he said.\u00a0\"Then, when I decided to follow the story, it was about Paul Manyasi, who is not me.\"", "Speaking in the same interview,\u00a0lawyer James Mbugua\u00a0accused Sky News of \"stage managing\" and \"unprofessional conduct\".", "\"Our clients were not consulted before the story was published. They were given insufficient information. And the story which has been published right now is saying that my client is dead. Well, you've seen for yourself that my client is alive and kicking,\" he said.", "He said that Cedric's\u00a0father, Isaac Beti,\u00a0did not tell\u00a0Sky News that his son was called Manyasi.", "Shortly after Sky News published its investigation, Isaac Beti confirmed to\u00a0Kenyan TV channel KTN\u00a0that his son was in prison and that he was planning on visiting him.", "In a statement, Colnet, the cleaning company 'Paul Manyasi' allegedly worked for, also denied having an employee by that name.", "The Kenya Airport Authority (KAA)\u00a0said it has carried out its own investigations following the report and concluded that there was no employee called Paul Manyasi registered at\u00a0Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.", "In a statement on November 22, 2019, Sky News apologised to Colnet for \"suggesting the stowaway was one of their employees\".", "\"Sky News regrets that our reporting was founded on misleading information,\" it said.", "Contacted by AFP, a spokeswoman for London's Met Police said that efforts to identify the stowaway were ongoing.", "\"Fingerprints of the man have been taken and sent through the National Crime Agency to Interpol in Nairobi. The Met Police has been informed that a forensic fingerprint analysis was conducted with a negative result,\"\u00a0she said via email.", "The stowaway's identity currently remains a mystery.
