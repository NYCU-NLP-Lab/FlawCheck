["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Produced by the political arm of the Defenders of Wildlife Action, a new television ad takes aim at Sarah Palin\u2019s position on wildlife issues. The minute-long video starts by juxtaposing Palin\u2019s darkened picture with majestic images of a bear and a wolf, while an announcer talks about her support for an aerial predator-control program.", "\"The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,\" the narrator says.", "\"Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,\" the narrator says. \"Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?\"", "The ad shows grisly video footage: low-flying aircraft with gunners leaning out the door shooting wolves and bears from the air. The plane later lands and the shooter finalizes the kill. In one picture, a wolf\u2019s carcass hangs from one of the plane\u2019s wing braces.", "For this item, we'll focus on the claim that Palin promotes \"aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife.\"", "Palin\u2019s record on the issue is actually quite clear. As a candidate, and as governor, the Republican has endorsed wildlife management practices that include the controversial use of airplanes to thin out predator populations.", "But in Alaska, frontier politics look different than they do in the Lower 48. Alaska has vast populations of wolves, bears, caribou and\u00a0moose, and\u00a0sportsmen who hunt and sometimes live off those species.", "\u201cIf I am elected, I don\u2019t want you to be surprised that I am a proponent of predator control in order to build those populations of moose and caribou,\u201d Palin said, according to news reports from a gubernatorial debate in 2006.", "Alaska state officials take issue with the use of the phrase \u201caerial hunting,\u201d preferring \u201caerial shooting.\u201d", "\u201cThe predator-control program that we do \u2014 that isn\u2019t hunting and we never claimed it is,\u201d said Tim Barry, spokesman for the Alaska Department of Fish & Game. \u201cIt deliberately gives hunters an unfair advantage. That\u2019s what we want.\u201d", "It\u2019s tougher to assess the ad\u2019s subjective assessment that such practices are \u201cbrutal and unethical,\u201d though many wildlife groups would agree. Defenders of Wildlife has filed\u00a0lawsuits challenging Alaska\u2019s wildlife management practices. President Rodger Schlickeisen said his group takes the view that any killing of animals, outside of a biological emergency, is unwarranted. In September 2007, more than 120 scientists signed a letter to Palin that questioned the biological basis for the state\u2019s intensive predator management.", "Aerial hunting has been banned since 1972 in every state but Alaska, which gets around the federal law by claiming that predator population control is more important.", "The\u00a0ad is missing an important note of context.\u00a0Unlike other areas around the United States where wolf populations are smaller, Alaska officials count between 7,000 and 11,000 in the state. Wolf populations are managed in five parts of the state as part of a program that began in 2003 under former Gov. Frank Murkowski.", "In 2007, Palin\u2019s administration proposed enhancements to encourage hunters to kill more wolves when it became clear that not enough wolves were being taken out of the population to meet the state\u2019s goal for the year. Palin\u2019s office announced a plan to pay hunters $150 for each wolf killed with the money to be paid when hunters turned in the left foreleg of dead wolves to state biologists. The program was axed by a judge who ruled it an improper bounty on wildlife.", "\u201cI have said many times that my administration is committed to management of game for abundance, and to a proactive, science-based predator management program where appropriate,\u201d the governor said in a news release at the time.", "We find her actions are adequate to support the statement that she promotes aerial shooting. But the environmental group\u2019s categorization of the program is debatable and not putting it within the context of a state predator management program is a bit misleading.
