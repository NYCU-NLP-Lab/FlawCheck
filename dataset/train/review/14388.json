He has said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should be listed as a terrorist organization.", "And, during a speech at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Monday, Gorka took it a step further in saying that militant groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State whose leaders are fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are less dangerous than Iran, led by fundamentalist Shiite Muslims.", "\"The far larger threat to America is, in fact, Shia jihadism \u2013 meaning Iran, and meaning the mullahs. Not the people of Iran or Persians, but the Iranian Republican regime,\" Gorka said.", "\"Why? \u2026 this is a regime which every Friday declares war on us \u2013 war and destruction. That America and Israel must be destroyed.\" He raised his voice to emphasize \"every Friday.\"", "Do Iran\u2019s leaders declare war on the United States \"every Friday,\" as Gorka suggests?", "Trump and Iran\u2019s supreme leader have certainly engaged in a war of words recently, with Trump calling a branch of the Iranian armed forces the leader\u2019s \"corrupt personal terror force and militia.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei jabbed back, telling local media that Trump is \"foul-mouthed\" and \"pretends to be an idiot.\"", "But PolitiFact wondered if it\u2019s possible that Iran has been at war with the United States.
