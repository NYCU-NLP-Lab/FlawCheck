But he did well enough in upstate New York\u2019s largest concentration of Democrats to excite Erie County Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy.", "\"Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford, and we found that to be substantial,\" Langworthy told WBFO, the NPR member station in Buffalo. \"He carried towns that haven't gone Republican in years and years in a presidential election, towns like West Seneca and Hamburg. And, he won Cheektowaga, a critical town.\"", "So did Trump really get better results in Erie County than any Republican nominee since Gerald Ford?", "Difference in votes", "Langworthy based his claim on the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival. She won 27,153 more votes than Trump in Erie County, according to the Erie County Board of Elections.", "That\u2019s a tighter margin than in any previous presidential election since 1984, when Democrat Walter Mondale beat Reagan by 15,049 votes in Erie County. Ford\u2019s margin was even tighter in 1976, when he lost to Jimmy Carter by 9,087 votes in Erie County.", "Number of votes", "We also looked at the total number of votes the candidates received.", "Trump received 188,303 votes in Erie County in the 2016 election -- more votes in Erie County for a Republican candidate for president since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won 188,796 votes.", "Reagan received 222,882 votes in his 1984 re-election race.", "Ford won 220,310 votes in Erie County in 1976.", "Percentage of votes", "Looking at the candidates\u2019 percentage of the vote - not their vote counts - offers a more accurate gauge of their strength because Erie County\u2019s population has fallen since the 1970s.", "Trump won 44.4 percent of the total vote in Erie County - excluding blank and voided ballots - in the 2016 election. That is the highest percentage for a Republican candidate since the 1984 election, when Reagan won 48.2 percent of the county vote. Ford won 48.7 percent of the vote in his race in 1976.", "Our ruling", "Langworthy said \"Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford\" in Erie County.", "When we reached Langworthy to ask about his claim, he acknowledged his mistake. He said he made the claim before he had the official results from the county Board of Elections.", "\"I think it\u2019s significant that he performed as well as he did,\" Langworthy said of Trump\u2019s vote tally in Erie County. \"My point is that Democrats came over to vote for him.\"", "Trump won the highest percentage of the Erie County vote for president since the 1984 election. Trump did better than any Republican candidate since Reagan - not Ford. Reagan\u2019s number of votes and percentage of votes were higher than Trump\u2019s.", "We rate Langworthy\u2019s claim as False.", "\"NYS, local GOP enjoying victory tour\", WBFO, Dec. 14, 2016, Accessed Dec. 15, 2016", "Phone conversation with Erie County Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy", "Phone and email conversation with the Erie County Board of Elections", "Election results from 1976 - 2000 obtained from the Erie County Board of Elections via email", "Election results from 2004 - 2016 on the Erie County Board of Elections website, Accessed Dec. 29, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
