Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward one that would prevent $1,400 stimulus checks from going to prisoners. The amendment failed on a party-line vote.", "Cotton tweeted that this was another example of spending tucked in the bill that had nothing to do with pandemic.", "\"Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,\" he tweeted March 6. \"They haven\u2019t lost their jobs, they aren\u2019t worried about paying rent or buying groceries.\"", "Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison. They haven\u2019t lost their jobs, they aren\u2019t worried about paying rent or buying groceries. Another example of the unrelated spending in the Democrats\u2019 partisan slush fund.", "Cotton repeated his point March 8 on Fox News, saying \"every single Democrat\" wanted to send checks to prisoners \u2014 invoking Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof.", "The record shows that Democrats rejected the amendment to prevent payments to prisoners.", "Sen.

Prisoners must be a citizen or legal resident, and either need to have filed a tax return, possibly as part of a joint filing, or complete an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the two previous rounds of stimulus checks during the Trump administration \u2014 in the CARES Act in March, and the supplemental package in December \u2014 allowed prisoners to receive checks, too.", "Cotton voted for both of those bills.", "His press secretary James Arnold said circumstances were different.

Only a few thousand got them, through an exception in the law for those who had just gone to jail.", "In 2020, Washington put a priority on getting checks to people as quickly as possible. The CARES Act kept the eligibility rules broad and simple. Basically, anyone who was an American citizen or permanent legal resident, wasn\u2019t claimed as a dependent by someone else, and had filed a tax return (or didn\u2019t need to because they made very little), could get a check.", "With the December bill, Republicans could have added a prisoner ban to the legislation before it came to an up-or-down vote.", "The issue of prisoners and stimulus checks had long been in the news. Earlier in the year, the IRS blocked CARES Act payments to prisoners. That prompted a class action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people, arguing that the IRS rule was arbitrary and unlawful.", "In October, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks. The judge ruled that the CARES Act had no language restricting payments to prisoners, and the administration couldn\u2019t invent one. That only applied to the CARES Act, but the point is, Republicans had ample opportunity to grapple with the issue as the December bill was being written.", "Despite having the right to stimulus checks, many prisoners hit a stumbling block: The IRS sent the inmates debit cards that some states couldn\u2019t process.", "Cotton said Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to people in prison.", "They did, arguing that to do otherwise would harm the families of prisoners.
