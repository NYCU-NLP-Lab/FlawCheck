That would be me.", "\"I don\u2019t have health care right now,\" Cruz said. \"I had purchased an individual policy and Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31.

That plan was purchased on the individual market, using a private insurance broker, with no government funds. At the time, the broker informed Sen. Cruz that the plan was being cancelled. The broker did not inform him that Blue Cross had automatically enrolled the family in another policy, an HMO with far more limited coverage. Based on this information, Sen. Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy.", "Frazier further said Cruz's family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO but planned to be covered by a Humana PPO effective March 1.", "A Politico news story on Cruz\u2019s Manchester remarks said that in 2015, Cruz and his wife, Heidi, on temporary leave from her job with Goldman Sachs, had purchased an individual plan after previously receiving coverage through the Wall Street firm.", "For this article, we looked into Cruz\u2019s claim that Blue Cross Blue Shield stopped selling health coverage in Texas at the end of 2015, leaving the market, as Cruz put it.", "Not so, we found, and the \"notice\" Cruz mentioned in New Hampshire may have been sent his way a couple months before the year ended, leaving time to consider options.", "July 2015 announcement", "We didn\u2019t hear back from Cruz about the basis of his statement.", "Meantime, the insurer in summer 2015 did announce changes to its Texas offerings.

If we kept the Blue Choice PPO, this would have raised the rates so much for all our other plans that most people wouldn't be able to afford them.
