Ted Cruz added fuel to the long-running fight when he claimed California \"is hemorrhaging population\" in a recent Senate debate with his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.", "Cruz argued O\u2019Rourke offers Texas a future with higher taxes similar to California.", "\"There are also states that implement the kind of policies that Congressman O\u2019Rourke supports, high taxes, high regulations, open borders, states--you look at California, which is hemorrhaging population. You know the cost of a one-way U-haul from California to Texas is more than 300% the cost the other way around.\"", "Sen. Cruz make his claim in the video above.", "In 2014, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the claim that U-hauls from California to Texas are more expensive.

We explored it in a recent fact check on Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox when he made an exaggerated claim that \"half the people\" in California want to leave.", "We reported that California\u2019s once-rapid population growth has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in from the rest of the country for many years, according to a February 2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.", "About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the American Community Survey.", "Here\u2019s who\u2019s moving from and to California, according to the report:", "\"Families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states (Texas, Arizona, and Nevada). College-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California from its top feeder states (New York, Illinois, and New Jersey).\"", "But we also found the gap between the number of Californians who left for other states and those who arrived from the rest of the country has narrowed considerably. That gap was several hundred thousand people per year in the 1990s and mid 2000s, but dropped to a few thousand per year during the Great Recession, before again increasing. Still, that\u2019s hardly a \"hemorrhaging,\" especially considering this is only a subset of the state\u2019s overall population.", "SOURCE: Feburary 2018 report, California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office", "Overall population continues to grow", "The migration to other states does not mean California\u2019s overall population is in decline.

But even that interpretation of the claim doesn\u2019t show a \"hemorrhaging.\" The gap between Californians leaving for other states and those arriving from the rest of the country narrowed considerably over the past decade.", "In the end, the senator ignored key facts that would give a different impression.", "We rate Cruz\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "MOSTLY FALSE \u2013\u00a0The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "U.S. Sen.
