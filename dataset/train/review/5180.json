Scott Walker made it in early 2011.", "Nevertheless, we asked Steineke -- who like Walker was elected in November of 2010 -- for \u00a0backup for the claim.

But it lives on in the archives, and in various retweeted versions.", "Walker\u2019s claim came Feb. 21, 2011, as protests got underway against the budget repair bill, which later became Act 10. The bill curtailed collective bargaining rights for most public employees and required them to pay more toward health care and pensions.", "The governor declared he would not negotiate on the bill: \"We are broke in this state. We have been broke for years.\" He repeated the mantra in his budget speech: \"The facts are clear: Wisconsin is broke and it\u2019s time to start paying our bills today -- so our kids are not stuck with even bigger bills tomorrow.\"", "A spokesman said Walker was referring to $58.7 million plus interest owed to Minnesota under a discontinued tax-reciprocity deal and at least $200 million owed to the Patient's Compensation Fund after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision.
