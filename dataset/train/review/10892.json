The website was updated that evening. It now reads: \"In 2011, our public lottery funded classrooms & other services by over $930 million.\"\n\nStill, Hahn said that didn\u2019t change the fundamental issue that the proposal is bad for businesses and taxpayers.\n\nThe history of privatization in New Jersey is a \"story of graft, fraud and cronyism leading to taxpayers being on the hook for political indiscretion,\" he said. \"We believe that when it comes to funding education, care for the developmentally disabled, and services for our veterans, New Jerseyans deserve better.\"\n\nBill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said the implication that the state is selling the lottery is false. He said a state agency \"will still have an oversight function\" and \"the state is going to continue to get the money from the lottery.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nBig Gamble NJ -- an advocacy group that opposes privatizing management of the state lottery -- said on its website that \u00a0\"in 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million.\"\n\nThe lottery funneled $930 million into education and other social services in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three quarters of that amount funded education-related initiatives.\n\nSo New Jersey\u2019s classroom didn\u2019t receive the full $930 million from the state lottery, but education aid comprised a significant majority of that money.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "Big Gamble NJ, Education, accessed Nov. 13, 2012\n\nE-mail and phone interviews with Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the New Jersey Lottery, Nov. 13-15, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Seth Hahn, New Jersey Legislative and Political Director for Communications Workers of America, Nov. 14, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Lottery, Revenue Recipients: Fiscal Year 2011, accessed Nov. 13, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Lottery, Annual Report: 2011, accessed Nov. 14, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Lottery, New Jersey Lottery Contributes More Than $950 Million to State Education and Institutions with Record Breaking Sales in Fiscal Year 2012, Aug. 20, 2012\n\nNew Jersey Treasury Department: Division of State Lottery, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information for June 30, 2011 and 2010, accessed Nov. 13, 2012\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer, New Jersey joins a list of states considering privatizing their lotteries, April 29, 2012\n\nThe Star-Ledger, Payout or gamble?
