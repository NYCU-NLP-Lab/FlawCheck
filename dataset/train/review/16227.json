Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?

Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That's very dangerous.\u201d", "A similar claim was also shared here and here on Twitter.", "The\u00a0claim is\u00a0misleading.", "This tweet on the WHO's official Twitter account states\u00a0in part: \u201cWhile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\u201d", "Below is a screenshot of the WHO's tweet:", "This video produced by the WHO gives advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection.", "The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which oversees the country\u2019s response to the novel coronavirus, has also not issued an advisory recommending frequent water intake.", "In the \u201cAbout Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d section of its website, the ministry lists washing hands frequently\u00a0and covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing\u00a0as \u201ceveryday preventive actions\u201d to take.", "Below is a screenshot of the relevant section of the website:", "There is no mention of frequent water intake in any of the advisories it has issued.
