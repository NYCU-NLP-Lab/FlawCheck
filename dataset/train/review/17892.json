That is voter fraud.\"", "\"That is voter fraud\" appeared in red lettering in the image.", "The image included a Sharpie pen and phone numbers identified as election hotlines for 15 states, primarily those that were battlegrounds for Trump and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. (The first number we tried, for Ohio, was for a Trump campaign office. Democrats have their own \"voter protection\" hotlines, too.)", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

So did the New York Times. A USA Today fact-check rated a similar claim in Michigan as false.", "Since then, the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office, saying it had received hundreds of complaints from residents, asked the Maricopa County Elections Department for information about the use of Sharpies and any instances of ballots being rejected because of bleed-throughs.", "But officials and experts have repeatedly knocked down #sharpiegate claims, which have been shared by the president\u2019s son, Eric Trump, among other Republicans.", "Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted on Nov. 4:", "\"IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!\"", "A letter dated Nov. 4 to voters from the Republican chairman and the only Democratic member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors explained why Sharpies were recommended and provided to voters.", "\"We did extensive testing on multiple different types of ink with our new vote tabulation equipment.
