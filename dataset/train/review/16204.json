It appears it originated with various news websites that conflated an Oct. 9, 2020, California Department of Public Health list of general requirements with requirements for the upcoming holidays, and then the list took meme form on Facebook.", "For example, one headline from Newsweek, published Oct. 22, 2020, read, \"California Gov.

However, mitigation measures meant to slow the spread of the virus and protect public health, such as mask-wearing and quarantines, have been politicized.", "On Nov. 13, 2020, California released its actual guidance for the upcoming fall and winter holidays. The guidance included limitations placed on gathering depending on each county's restrictions, which are based on local disease rates. The state further recommends that people in high-risk groups, namely the elderly or those with preexisting conditions, do not attend gatherings, with social distancing, hand washing, and mask wearing also recommended.
