["By Katie Busch", "Posted on September 25, 2020", "A social media post claims that Social Security checks have not been sent by mail \u201csince 2013 because it\u2019s not secure.\u201d The Social Security Administration required electronic payment transfers in compliance with a 1996 federal law \u2014 not due to security concerns. Even so, about 850,000 checks are still mailed each month.", "In late August, posts claiming that the Social Security Administration stopped using the postal service due to security concerns began circulating on Facebook.", "\u201cSocial Security checks do not go through the postal service since 2013 because it\u2019s not secure,\u201d one post reads. \u201cLet that sink in.\u201d", "The post has garnered over 19K shares since its publication on Aug. 20. A slightly different version of the post claimed that then-President Barack Obama had \u201cdetermined Social Security would not send checks through the USPS, because it was not secure!?\u201d", "More recently, this misleading statement has resurfaced on Twitter.", "\u201cSocial Security checks do not go through the postal service since 2013 \u2026 because it\u2019s not secure,\u201d reads a Sept. 20 tweet. \u201cLet that sink in.\u201d", "Though these tweets have received significantly less attention than their Facebook counterparts, they still perpetuate the same misinformation.", "It\u2019s true that most Social Security beneficiaries were required to switch to electronic payment in 2013. But the law wasn\u2019t motivated by security concerns and some beneficiaries still receive their Social Security checks in the mail.", "Shortly after the new requirement was implemented, Social Security Administration official Theresa Gruber told a Senate committee that the switch to electronic payment had been mandated by 1996 law that required \u201call federal payments [to] be made electronically after January 1, 1999, with limited exceptions.\u201d", "\u201cOver time and through regulation, Treasury has encouraged more and more beneficiaries to receive their benefit payments electronically,\u201d Gruber testified on June 19, 2013. Treasury issued a final rule in late December 2010 that required Social Security checks to be sent electronically, and it took effect March 2013, she said.", "Prior to the 2013 electronic payment mandate, about 94% of Social Security retirement benefits and 83% of Supplemental Security Income payments were already being made electronically, she testified.", "Additionally, beneficiaries can still apply for a waiver that exempts them from the electronic requirement.", "As of September, the Social Security Administration sent paper checks to 852,279 people who get either\u00a0Social Security\u00a0or\u00a0Supplemental Security Income\u00a0payments. That\u2019s about 1.2% of the 72,296,327 people who received payments that month, according to official data.", "At the Senate hearing,\u00a0Gruber listed the benefits of the electronic transfers, which included a savings in check distribution costs, easier payment during natural disasters, and increased ease of payment tracking. She said it cost the federal government $1.25 to issue a paper check, but only 9 cents for electronic payments.", "\u201cOne of the objectives of the 1996 Act was to save the government money through increased EFT [electronic fund transfer] use,\u201d the U.S. General Accounting Office \u2014 known now as the Government Accountability Office \u2014 said in a 2002 report.", "Gruber did mention that electronic payments also offered some security benefits, such as the minimized risks of check theft or loss. In 2011, over 440,000 Social Security checks were reported lost or stolen and over $70 million worth of checks were fraudulently endorsed.", "However, electronic payments come with their own security concerns, such as identity theft that can result in Social Security payments being rerouted to another bank account without the beneficiary\u2019s knowledge.", "The social media posts started circulating in August at a time when President Donald Trump questioned whether the United States Postal Service could handle the surge of mail-in ballots that are expected in the 2020 election. As we have written, the president has relentlessly attacked mail-in voting as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cfraudulent.\u201d", "But, contrary to the social media posts, the Social Security Administration didn\u2019t stop mailing checks in 2013 \u201cbecause it\u2019s not secure.\u201d It was done to comply with a 1996 law, which was primarily designed to save the federal government money. And, as we said, about 850,000 checks are still mailed each month.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
