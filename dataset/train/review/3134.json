["By Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on February 27, 2019 | Corrected on February 28, 2019", "In a televised town hall, newly announced presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated several misleading claims that we have written about in the past.", "The town hall was televised on CNN on Feb. 25, just a few days after Sanders launched a second bid for the presidency. As we mentioned, he discussed health care, taxes and economic inequality, among other topics.", "Sanders repeated the misleading claim that Trump sought to \u201cthrow 32 million people off of the health care they had.\u201d Some of those are people who would choose not to get insurance if the mandate penalty were removed, so it\u2019s misleading to say they\u2019d all be thrown off.", "The figure Sanders cites is a government estimate of what would happen if Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. The effect of a repeal and replace bill \u2014 which failed to emerge from the Senate \u2014 was not forecast to result in as severe a decline in the number of uninsured. Trump supported the Republican-backed American Health Care Act \u2014 a bill that sought partial repeal and replacement of the ACA \u2014 but when that plan faltered, he also advocated for an immediate repeal of the ACA, with a replacement at a \u201clater date.\u201d", "If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017", "Sanders relies on a July 19, 2017, Congressional Budget Office estimate of the effect of the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, which fits the bill as a \u201crepeal and then replace at a later date\u201d approach. The CBO did forecast that the bill would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years.", "But not all of them would be thrown off their insurance, as Sanders said. As the CBO notes, \u201cIn the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.\u201d", "The ACA imposed a tax penalty on those without health insurance, but the mandate penalty was repealed as part of the new tax law, effective Jan. 1.", "The Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act would have repealed coverage provisions of the ACA after 2020, with the delay \u201cpresumably giving Congress time to come up with a replacement,\u201d Timothy Jost wrote for Health Affairs. What a replacement plan might have looked like is unknown, and CBO did not estimate what the effects of a replacement bill would have on the uninsured. But in his tweet, Trump did advocate for a replacement bill \u201cat a later date.\u201d", "Moreover, Trump did support the \u00a0American Health Care Act \u2014 the main repeal-and-replace effort in 2017. The House passed it, but the Senate did not and it died. That year, Sanders and numerous Democrats claimed the bill would throw 24 million people off the health insurance they have. As we wrote then, however, while an\u00a0analysis by the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation did say that 24 million fewer Americans would be insured under the American Health Care Act than under current law in 2026, not all of them would \u201close\u201d insurance they have \u201ctoday\u201d or be \u201ckicked off\u201d their policies, as some Democrats described it. Rather, we wrote, the 24 million represents a complicated mix of some losing insurance, some deciding not to have it, others gaining it and others not being eligible for Medicaid insurance in the future.", "One other thing to note, as our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post pointed out, CBO has since revised its estimate of the impact of repealing the individual mandate to buy insurance. In a May 2018 CBO report, the Post noted, repeal of the individual mandate is now projected to result in 8 million fewer insured by the end of the decade \u2014 half the number CBO initially forecast.", "Sanders repeated the Democratic talking point that under the Republican tax plan championed by Trump, \u201c83 percent of the benefits go to the 1 percent.\u201d", "But as we have written, that\u2019s misleading. It\u2019s true for 2027, but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then.", "The Republican tax legislation, which Trump signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017, allows most of its individual income tax provisions to expire after 2025, making the tax benefit distribution more lopsided for the top 1 percent than in earlier years.", "In 2018, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of income earners would get 20.5 percent of the tax cut benefits. In 2025, that percentage would be 25.3 percent, with the top 1 percent (those earning above $837,800) getting an average tax cut of $61,090.", "Just two years later, in 2027, the percentage of tax benefits to this income group jumps to 82.8 percent, \u201cbecause almost all individual income tax provisions\u00a0would sunset after 2025,\u201d the TPC explains. The top 1 percent still benefits from some of the remaining tax cuts, such as reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. But their average tax cut drops by nearly two-thirds to $20,660 in 2027.", "Why do these individual tax cuts expire in the law? Republicans say\u00a0they expect a future Congress will extend those cuts, rather than allowing taxes for many to increase. But in order to pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate, Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Nor could they have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.", "The tax law is expected to increase the deficit by $1.46 trillion over 10 years,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.", "Sanders said that while Trump promised during the campaign not to cut Social Security or Medicare, his proposed 2019 budget included cuts of $500 billion to Medicare and $72 billion to Social Security. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, says \u201cthe proposed savings from Social Security and Medicare are in fact quite modest in size, would have little effect on benefits, and would actually reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for most seniors.\u201d", "Sanders: I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s not just a president who said to the working class of this country, \u201cI am on your side, I\u2019m not going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,\u201d and then he came forward with a budget, trillion dollar cut to Medicaid, $500 billion to Medicare, and $72 billion to the Social Security Disability Fund.", "Presidents\u2019 proposed budgets are largely symbolic, more a statement of priorities than anything Congress actually takes up. Indeed, Congress had passed \u2014 and Trump signed \u2014 a bipartisan two-year spending bill a few days prior to the White House releasing its FY 2019 budget proposal.", "While the president\u2019s budget proposal does include spending reductions for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Sanders\u2019 claim is \u201cextremely misleading when it comes to Social Security and Medicare \u2013 less so for Medicaid.\u201d", "In a Feb. 16, 2018, analysis of Democratic claims that Trump\u2019s budget would \u201cslash,\u201d \u201cgut\u201d and \u201cdevastate\u201d Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, CRFB writes: \u201cIt is certainly true that the budget proposes substantial reductions in Medicaid spending, but the proposed savings from Social Security and Medicare are in fact quite modest in size, would have little effect on benefits, and would actually reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for most seniors.\u201d", "Let\u2019s take these one at a time.", "Sanders said Trump\u2019s budget would cut Medicare by $500 billion. While the Congressional Budget Office noted direct spending on Medicare would decrease by $472 billion over 10 years under the president\u2019s proposal, Goldwein notes that some of that is due to moving \u201cgraduate medical education\u201d and \u201cuncompensated care\u201d from the Medicare budget to other parts of the budget.", "According to CRFB\u2019s analysis, the Trump budget would reduce future Medicare spending increases by about $334 billion, and \u201ccome exclusively from reforming the delivery system, lowering drug prices, and reducing inefficiencies rather than cutting benefits for beneficiaries, and could be seen as broadly consistent with the President\u2019s promise during the 2016 campaign not to cut Medicare benefits.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d the analysis says, \u201cthe Medicare policies in the budget would have the effect of reducing drug prices, health care costs, Medicare premiums, and cost sharing. In other words, President Trump\u2019s Medicare policies would reduce costs faced by seniors.\u201d", "\u201cMany of the President\u2019s (Medicare) policies are similar to those put forward by President Obama,\u201d CRFB says.", "As for Social Security, the $25 billion in reductions amounts to \u201cless than 0.2 percent over a decade,\u201d CRFB states, and \u201cimportantly, most of these changes are meant to reduce overlapping or improper payments and address certain inequities in the program.\u201d In fact, the analysis states, \u201cJust over half of the savings come from policies also proposed by President Obama in his own budgets.\u201d", "To get to $72 billion, Sanders also includes $48 billion the Trump budget claims to save from \u201cSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income \u2026 from testing and eventually implementing different return-to-work strategies in these programs,\u201d CRFB says. Goldwein said that $48 billion is \u201cphony baloney,\u201d a mere pilot program that is likely to only save a fraction of that amount. (CBO estimates total Social Security savings in the Trump plan at a much more modest $18 billion over 10 years.)", "\u201cWhen it comes to Social Security and Medicare, there is no slashing, gutting, or devastating to be found,\u201d CRFB states.", "Sanders may have a point with Medicaid, CRFB states. Outlays for Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and non-defense discretionary spending would be reduced \u201cat least 25 percent below their baseline levels for 2019-2028, with even deeper cuts in 2028.\u201d", "\u201cClaims that Medicaid spending is significantly reduced in the budget are therefore reasonable,\u201d CRFB says. Goldwein said the net effect of cuts to Medicaid are close to $1 trillion.", "Sanders again exaggerated the gap in health care spending between the U.S. and the rest of the world. \u201cWe\u2019re now spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as any other country,\u201d Sanders said, echoing a similar claim he has made since at least 2015.", "Sanders has a point that the U.S. spends a lot more on health care than other nations. But he went beyond the facts by saying America spends nearly twice as much as any other country.", "The U.S. spent $10,209 per capita in 2017, according to the most recent data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD. That\u2019s more than double the 2017 OECD average of $4,069 per capita, and quite a lot more than most other developed nations.", "However, Switzerland spent $8,009 per capita, Luxembourg spent $6,475 per capita and Norway spent $6,351 per capita. So, the U.S. didn\u2019t spend almost double what they did.", "Sanders also claimed: \u201cIn the United States right now, we have more income and wealth inequality than any other country on Earth.\u201d That, too, is an exaggerated statement that Sanders has been making for a while.", "The U.S. does not have more income inequality than any other country, according to the OECD Income Distribution Database.", "Measured by the \u201cGini coefficient,\u201d which the OECD says \u201cis based on the comparison of cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of income they receive,\u201d the U.S. ranks 6th out of the 38 industrialized nations for which the organization tabulated income inequality. As of 2016, the U.S. had a rating of 0.39 on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 indicating \u201cperfect equality\u201d and 1 indicating \u201cperfect inequality.\u201d Countries with a higher inequality rating than the U.S. were South Africa, Costa Rica, Mexico, Chile and Turkey.", "By another measure, which calculates a country\u2019s share of \u201cdisposable\u201d income held by the richest 10 percent of individuals, the U.S. (at 6.3 percent) ranked 5th. In that category, the U.S. again trailed South Africa, Costa Rica, Mexico and Chile.", "As far as wealth inequality \u2014 which is different from income inequality \u2014 the U.S. does top the OECD\u2019s list, at least when countries are ranked by the share of wealth held by the wealthiest households.", "\u201cBased on top wealth shares, household net wealth is most unequally distributed in the United States, where the richest 10% of households own 79% of total wealth, while the richest 1% holds 42%,\u201d the OECD said in a June 2018 report.", "But the OECD\u2019s Wealth Distribution Database doesn\u2019t include a wealth inequality calculation for every country.", "When we checked the 2018 Global Wealth Report, which the Credit Suisse Research Institute published in October, we found that the U.S. had less wealth inequality than some nations the OECD leaves out.", "The institute estimated that, in 2018, the richest 10 percent of Americans owned 75.9 percent of all the country\u2019s wealth (see table 6-5 on page 156). That put the U.S. in 5th place out of the 41 economies covered by the report. Countries with greater wealth concentrations were Thailand (85.7 percent), Russia (81.8 percent), Turkey (81.2 percent) and India (77.4 percent).", "When looking at the share held by the wealthiest 5 percent, the U.S. (63.3 percent) fell to 6th place behind those same four countries and Indonesia. And when considering the share held by the wealthiest 1 percent, the U.S. (35.3 percent) moved down further, to 12th place behind the five previously mentioned countries, as well as Colombia, Czech Republic, Mexico, Sweden, South Africa and Finland.", "We asked the Sanders campaign what supporting information the senator had for his claims about income and wealth inequality in the U.S. So far, we have yet to receive a response.", "Correction, Feb. 28: An earlier version of this story cited outdated CBO data on the revised impact of repealing the individual mandate on the number of uninsured.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
