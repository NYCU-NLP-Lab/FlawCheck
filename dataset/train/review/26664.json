["About this rating", "In mid-August 2019, in the wake of back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that left 31 people dead over a single weekend, some social media users began highlighting a seemingly recent Associated Press news report about a single weekend of violence in Chicago that left 11 people dead and several dozen more wounded. Why was this event not receiving much broader and more prominent news coverage, those social media users asked?", "In fact, the story did garner substantial news coverage, as evidenced by the fact that it was reported on by the Associated Press (a national news agency) and other national news publications such as USA Today.", "The reason that story seemingly wasn't receiving much news coverage in mid-August 2019 was because it described events that had taken place more than a year earlier, over the first weekend of August in 2018. While the topic might nonetheless remain an apt subject for discussion well afterwards, news outlets do not typically re-report events from the past unless substantial new activity related to them has occurred.", "Madhani, Aamer. \u00a0 \"At Least 72 Shot, 13 Killed in Chicago Over Violent Summer Weekend, Police Department Says.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 USA Today. \u00a0 6 August 2019.", "Tarm, Michael. \u00a0 \"11 Dead, Nearly 70 Wounded in Weekend Violence in Chicago.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Associated Press. \u00a0 6 August 2019.", "David Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
