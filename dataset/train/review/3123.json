["By Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson", "Posted on July 16, 2018", "Asked whether he believed U.S. intelligence agencies or Russian President Vladimir Putin on whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, President Donald Trump declined to directly respond. Instead, he raised questions about the Russia investigation, including referring to a conspiracy theory that was shot down by his own Justice Department.", "In a joint press conference with Putin after the two men met privately in Helsinki on July 16, Trump was asked by a reporter,\u00a0\u201cWho do you believe?\u201d \u2014 Putin or U.S. intelligence agencies. In his answer, Trump said: \u201cI have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\u201d Here\u2019s the full question and response:", "Reporter, July 16: Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. What \u2014 who \u2014 my first question for you, sir, is who do you believe? My second question is would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again?", "Trump: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven\u2019t they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee?", "I\u2019ve been wondering that, I\u2019ve been asking that for months and months and I\u2019ve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying?", "With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think it\u2019s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server.", "But I have \u2014 I have confidence in both parties. I \u2014 I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don\u2019t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They\u2019re missing; where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails? 33,000 e-mails gone \u2014 just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn\u2019t be gone so easily. I think it\u2019s a disgrace that we can\u2019t get Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 e-mails.", "I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators, with respect to the 12 people. I think that\u2019s an incredible offer. Ok? Thank you.", "We\u2019ll explain the facts regarding the DNC server, the \u201cPakistani gentleman\u201d and Clinton\u2019s emails.", "One of the ways that the president cast doubt on the FBI\u2019s investigation of Russia was to question why the Democratic National Committee refused to give federal investigators access to the computer server that had been breached by hackers.", "It\u2019s true that the FBI never got access to the DNC computer server. It is also true that Trump has been \u201ccalling it out on social media\u201d for many months.", "But there is no evidence that the FBI\u2019s failure to obtain the server hurt its investigation into Russian hackers.", "James Comey, the FBI director at the time, testified before Congress on March 20, 2017, that investigators would have preferred to have access to the server, but it received \u201can appropriate substitute\u201d in the form of a forensic report in June 2016 from a well-respected private cybersecurity company hired by the DNC.", "Here is Comey\u2019s exchange with Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican of Texas, about the DNC server.", "Hurd, March 20, 2017: Have you been able to \u2014 when did the DNC provide access for \u2014 to the FBI for your technical folks to review what happened?", "Comey: We never got direct access to the machines themselves. The DNC, in the spring of 2016, hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system.", "Hurd: [National Security Agency] Director [Michael] Rogers, did the NSA ever get access to the DNC hardware?", "Rogers: The NSA didn\u2019t ask for access. That\u2019s not in our job \u2014 .", "Hurd: Good copy. So, director, FBI notified the DNC early, before any information was put on WikiLeaks and when \u2014 you have still been \u2014 never been given access to any of the technical or the physical machines that were \u2014 that were hacked by the Russians.", "Comey: That\u2019s correct although we got the forensics from the pros that they hired which \u2014 again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this \u2014\u00a0my folks tell me was an appropriate substitute.", "Comey was referring to CrowdStrike \u2014 the cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC.", "In a Senate hearing\u00a0two months earlier, Comey had described CrowdStrike as\u00a0\u201ca highly respected private company.\u201d He said that his office made \u201cmultiple requests\u201d for access to the DNC server, but \u201cwhat was agreed to is the private company would share with us what they saw.\u201d", "Comey\u2019s testimony that CrowdStrike\u2019s forensic report was \u201can appropriate substitute\u201d has been borne out by the July 13\u00a0indictment\u00a0of 12 members of GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency.\u00a0(The indictment comes five months after the Department of Justice announced\u00a0the indictment\u00a0of 13 Russian nationals and three Russian-based companies, including the Internet Research Agency, for illegally operating\u00a0an extensive pro-Trump social media campaign during the 2016 election.)", "In a press release announcing the latest indictment, the Department of Justice said the GRU officers \u201cengaged in a sustained effort to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201d", "The indictment details how and when the Russian agents breached the servers of the DNC, DCCC and the Clinton campaign, and what information they stole.", "For example, the indictment alleges that\u00a0Aleksey Viktorovich Lukashev used the account \u201cjohn356gh\u201d at a URL-shortening service to send a spearfishing email to John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign.", "\u201cLukashev altered the appearance of the sender email address in order to make it look like the email was a security notification from Google (a technique known as \u2018spoofing\u2019), instructing the user to change his password by clicking the embedded link,\u201d the indictment said.", "The ruse worked. Podesta changed his password, and the Russians stole more than 50,000 of his emails on or about March 21, 2016, the indictment says.", "The indictment also details how the Russian agents allegedly moved the data from the Democratic computers to the Russian servers. The Russians used malware known as X-Tunnel to move stolen documents from the DNC through encrypted channels to a leased computer located in Illinois.", "David P. Fidler, a professor of law at Indiana University Bloomington and cybersecurity expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, cited the details contained in the indictment as evidence that the FBI was able to determine who hacked the DNC servers without having access to the server.", "\u201cMany commentators noted how detailed the indictment is, demonstrating not only the quality of the information gathered but also the DOJ\u2019s belief the evidence would stand up in a court of law under the criminal standard of \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt,'\u201d Fidler told us.", "John Villasenor, a professor at UCLA and a nonresident senior fellow in Governance Studies and the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings, and\u00a0Andreas Haeberlen, an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, both said that in general it would be better for investigators to have access to a computer server that had been hacked.", "\u201cAs a general matter, if there is concern that a system has been hacked, the effectiveness of the investigation will be maximized if investigators have access to as many of the components of the system as possible,\u201d Villasenor said.", "Comey made a similar point during his testimony, but as Haeberlen noted, Comey also expressed high regard for CrowdStrike.", "\u201cIf the FBI knew and trusted the company that did the analysis, and if the analysis was done using tools that were comparable to the ones the FBI itself would have used, then it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to rely on that analysis instead of re-doing it in-house,\u201d Haeberlen said. \u201cThe fact that Comey refers to them as professionals \u2026 and the fact that the FBI\u2019s own experts apparently didn\u2019t have any issues with the report \u2026 suggests that this was indeed the case.\u201d", "For more on the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, see our timeline on key events.", "In continuing to ask \u201cwhere are those servers,\u201d Trump mentioned \u201ca Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC.\u201d", "Trump, July 16:\u00a0What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They\u2019re missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails? 33,000 emails gone, just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn\u2019t be gone so easily.", "The president has mentioned this before, referring to a \u201cPakistani mystery man\u201d in a tweet in April, and using the man\u2019s name in a June 7 tweet:", "Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a \u201cplea deal\u201d to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2018", "The U.S. Department of Justice\u00a0struck a plea deal on July 3 with former congressional IT staffer\u00a0Imran Awan, who pleaded guilty to making a false statement on an application for a home equity line of credit. The plea document, written by U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, who was nominated by Trump,\u00a0shot down theories that claimed Awan had stolen computer equipment or government information. Trump himself, in his April tweet, claimed that Awan held \u201cdocuments.\u201d", "But Trump\u2019s DOJ said in its letter to Awan\u2019s attorney that it had investigated public allegations about stolen equipment or illegal actions with House computer systems, and it found \u201cno evidence\u201d that Awan had engaged in such activity.", "Department of Justice letter, Re: United States v. Imran Awan, July 3: The Government conducted a thorough investigation of those allegations, including interviewing approximately 40 witnesses; taking custody of the House Democratic Caucus server, along with other computers, hard drives, and electronic devices; examining those devices, including inspecting their physical condition and analyzing log-in and usage data; reviewing electronic communications between pertinent House employees; consulting with the House Office of General Counsel and House information technology personnel to access and/or collect evidence; and questioning your client during numerous voluntary interviews. The Government has uncovered no evidence that your client violated federal law with respect to the House computer systems. Particularly, the Government has found no evidence that your client illegally removed House data from the House network or from House Members\u2019 offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus Server, stole or destroyed\nHouse information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information.", "In February 2017, news broke that the U.S. Capitol Police were investigating allegations that five individuals had stolen equipment and violated House IT policies. They included Awan and family members who worked for multiple House lawmakers.", "Awan worked partly for the offices of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2011 to the summer of 2016. Wasserman Schultz didn\u2019t fire Awan until July 2017, when he was arrested and charged with bank fraud. An affidavit in the case said Awan and his wife, who are from Pakistan, fraudulently used a rental property, as opposed to a primary residence, to secure a home equity line of credit and subsequently wired the money to Pakistan.", "Wasserman Schultz, who told the Sun Sentinel in 2017 that she had concerns about racial and ethnic profiling in the case, faced criticism for not firing Awan sooner. And the\u00a0investigation sparked conspiracies alleging Awan had something to do with the hacking of DNC computer systems \u2014 hacking that the U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed to Russia.", "BuzzFeed News detailed the evolution of the conspiracy theories in 2017, finding that even Fox News\u2019 Geraldo Rivera floated the allegation that Awan could have given the hacked DNC emails to WikiLeaks.", "Wasserman Schultz told the Florida newspaper that Awan had never worked for the DNC. More important, Trump\u2019s own Justice Department, in its plea letter, debunked claims that Awan had stolen equipment, information or documents from the government.", "As for Trump\u2019s reference to Clinton\u2019s 33,000 missing emails, the president was referring to the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.", "In 2014, at the request of the State Department,\u00a0Clinton turned over about 30,000 work-related emails\u00a0that she sent or received while secretary of state on her private server and ordered another nearly 32,000 emails\u00a0deleted that she said were personal.\u00a0During the campaign, Trump accused Clinton of destroying work-related emails that should have been turned over to the State Department and reviewed by the FBI during its investigation into her handling of classified information.", "At a July 5, 2016, press conference, where he announced that the FBI would recommend that no charges be filed against Clinton, Comey said the FBI had recovered \u201cseveral thousand\u201d work-related emails that had not been turned over to the State Department. But the agency \u201cfound no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d", "\u2014 Eugene Kiely and Lori Robertson, with Robert Farley", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
