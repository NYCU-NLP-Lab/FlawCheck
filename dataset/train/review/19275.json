It seems like I really should share, because this original film seems to have taken on a somewhat classic-movie nostalgia and I get it\u2014 it\u2019s a really cool, great movie. Also people seem to love RDJ more than ever; I get that too- he\u2019s very talented, and quite un-ugly. I had a blast working on it, one of my favorite career experiences ever. This prosthetic makeup was built by Stan Winston Studio, supervised by Shane Mahan, and applied by 3 of us\u2014 my boss, makeup department head Deborah La Mia Denaver, and by Richie Alonzo, and by me. I made a subsequent new sculpture and appliance for when it is more healed up and less ragged (previously posted). But this piece was made by the legendary artists of the late great Stan Winston\u2019s Studio. Fun Fact: These pix are from the VERY first day of filming the first IRON MAN, they are dated March 12, 2007. The very first shot of principal photography was Tony Stark waking up in the cave, with the RT device wired to his chest to keep him alive, courtesy of character Yinsen (actor Shaun Toub) #marvel #ironman #makeup #makeupartist #fxmakeup #makeupfx #prosthetics #charactermakeup #promua #prostheticmakeup #specialmakeupeffects #setlife #specialmakeupfx #sfxmakeup #comicbookmovies #sws #stanwinstonstudio #moviemakeup #rdj #tonystark #shanemahan #richiealonzo #robertdowneyjr #excelsior", "A post shared by  Jamie Kelman (@jkelmakeup) on Mar 11, 2018 at 6:34pm PDT", "IRON MAN (2008) - Marvel Studios is celebrating its 10th anniversary\u2014 happy 10 years of massive success, Marvel! I was the Key Makeup Artist on their very first and imo still best Marvel Entertainment MCU movie, but I know I\u2019m biased ;-)... not that I\u2019ve seen all of them cause I haven't. Fun fact: before Marvel was owned by Disney, this first film was considered \u2018an indie\u2019 film, with distribution by Paramount. Stan Winston Studio (SWS) built the most beautiful robotic suits that I\u2019ve ever seen for this movie. SWS, with Shane Mahan leading their team on this film, also made some other prosthetic makeups, including a fresh torn up version of this chest wound. We see their prosthetic at the first reveal of the new power-source on Tony Stark in the cave. But when production wanted another more healed version of his skin surrounding (and visually countersinking) the power-source in his chest, that build became my responsibility, with the support of Shane and my boss, Makeup Dept. Head Deborah LaMia Denaver. I applied this prosthetic makeup when it worked. Propmaster Russell Bobbitt was responsible for making the actual power-source prop, it was like a light-up hockey puck (see pic) Pictured here: silicone appliance makeup on the very brilliant actor, Robert Downey Jr that I sculpted, molded & ran at my home fx lab, KELMAN STUDIO. The clay sculpture is also in the pix (if u swipe) before it was molded. Also pictured is a sickly makeup on RDJ when his chest power device is stolen by Jeff Bridges villain character, leaving an empty gaping hole in his chest (hence the greenscreen paint to aid VFX to deepen the hole). Shoutout to his hairstylist Nina Paskowitz! If you\u2019re an IRON MAN fan, I previously posted another prosthetic makeup I made for this film, when in the story \u2018Tony Stark\u2019 first suffers the shrapnel wound in his chest.
