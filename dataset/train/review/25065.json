["About this rating", "A screenshot purporting to show a message posted by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands directed at United States President Donald Trump was picked up by the Washington Press blog on 19 June 2018:", "The Trump administration has a penchant for its dismal optics and an almost impressive ability to continue lowering the bar to previously unknown depths. This week, Trump and his tribalistic cohorts opted to punish those seeking asylum along the southern border by implementing a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that would call for the separation of parents and their children, an act so inhumane that it is inviting comparisons to Japanese internment camps of World War 2 and even the Holocaust.", "[...]", "But the international community has been especially outspoken in its opposition to this administration\u2019s visibly inhumane agenda, including the purported account of Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand, the King of the Netherlands, who posted a less-than-subtle threat to a president vying for his spot as one of the cruelest world leaders of this century.", "This is not genuine.
