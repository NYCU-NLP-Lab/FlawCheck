["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 10, 2018", "A Democratic TV ad in the Tennessee Senate race spins the facts on votes that Rep. Marsha Blackburn cast on health care:", "The TV ad was launched in early October by Majority Forward, a 501(c)(4) organization that is affiliated with the Democratic super PAC Senate Majority.", "Blackburn is running against Democrat\u00a0Phil Bredesen, a former Tennessee governor.", "We\u2019ll take the votes referenced in the ad in chronological order.", "In the ad, a woman named Elizabeth from Williamson County, Tennessee, says: \u201cCongresswoman Blackburn voted to give members of Congress health care for life.\u201d Majority Forward\u2019s support for the ad references a July 2012 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0It was not specifically a vote on congressional health benefits, though Democrats spun it that way at the time.", "What does the repeal of the ACA have to do with lawmakers\u2019 health care? When the health care legislation was being debated, an amendment by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley was added to the Senate bill to require that members of Congress and their staffs get insurance coverage through the ACA\u2019s exchanges \u2014 for those who buy their own coverage through the individual market \u2014 as opposed to continuing to get insurance through the\u00a0Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.", "The idea behind Grassley\u2019s amendment was that if the exchanges were good enough for other Americans, they should be good enough for Congress.", "This created some issues, however, for the Office of Personnel Management, which is essentially the human resources department for the federal government. (And it sparked a stream of false claims over the years about Congress being \u201cexempt\u201d from the health care law.)", "Federal employees can keep their FEHB coverage once they retire, provided they are eligible to retire and had at least five years of FEHB coverage immediately before retirement, or coverage for the entire period of their service. It\u2019s not free \u2014 they would continue to pay part of the premiums, just as they do while working.", "But once the ACA was enacted in 2010, it required members of Congress to eventually move to the ACA exchanges, which held the first open enrollment period in late 2013, for plans starting in January 2014. It looked like lawmakers would lose their health insurance retirement benefit.", "So, when House Republicans voted to repeal the law in 2012, Democrats made the argument that the vote would reinstate the benefit for Congress.", "An anonymous Democratic official told the Hill newspaper at the time: \u201cHouse Republicans are set to repeal the promise that members of Congress have health care just like everyone else and to restart the perk of lifetime government health care for themselves.\u201d", "This talking point, however, has grown stale. The ACA wasn\u2019t repealed, of course. And Congress didn\u2019t lose its retirement benefit, either.", "In October 2013, a few months before the ACA exchange coverage would take effect, the Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule saying that lawmakers and their staffs would still be eligible to join the FEHB in retirement, provided they had five years of continuous coverage through either the FEHB or the ACA exchanges, as the Congressional Research Service explained in a 2017 report.", "While some Democrats may have cast the repeal vote in 2012 as one that would have reinstated the health care retirement benefit, Republicans were focused on repealing other aspects of the law. Blackburn issued a statement the day of the vote, saying, \u201cObamacare was a mistake and I\u2019ll keep fighting to repeal it until we get this law off the books. House Republicans remain committed to working step-by-step to replace Obamacare with real\u00a0solutions.\u201d", "And the ad doesn\u2019t mention that eligible lawmakers had this so-called \u201chealth care for life\u201d benefit before the ACA and still have it today.", "In the ad, Elizabeth says she had an \u201cincredibly complicated\u201d delivery that required a lengthy hospital stay and would have cost about $950,000 without insurance. \u201cI met with Congresswoman Blackburn as they were talking about taking away maternity coverage from women,\u201d she says. \u201cShe basically said that there was nothing she could do.\u201d", "The reference is to the Republicans\u2019\u00a0American Health Care Act \u2014 one of the repeal-and-replace efforts in 2017. The House passed it, and Blackburn voted for it. The Senate did not pass it.", "The bill wouldn\u2019t have automatically taken away maternity coverage. But it would have allowed states to get waivers to change or waive the 10 essential health benefits requirement of the ACA for individual market and small-group market plans. That means some states could have waived a benefit requirement like maternity coverage for those markets.", "The ACA\u2019s 10 essential health benefits are:\u00a0ambulatory, emergency, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services and devices, laboratory services, preventive care and chronic disease management, and pediatric services including dental and vision.", "Before the ACA was enacted in 2010, 18 states offered some protections for maternity coverage in the individual or small-group market, and 11 of those required insurers in the individual market to include coverage of maternity care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Tennessee was not among those states.", "A 2012 report from the National Women\u2019s Law Center examined 3,331 individual market policies in state capitals in 48 states and Washington, D.C., and found that just 12 percent of them included maternity coverage. None of the 107 plans in Tennessee included such coverage, though 16 offered a separate maternity rider. Those riders, which function like add-on coverage to the main policy, cost $101.35 to $228.20 per month in the state. The NWLC report notes that riders often included waiting periods as well before they would cover a pregnancy.", "We can\u2019t predict whether Tennessee would have waived the maternity coverage requirements if the Republican health care bill had been enacted. But it certainly would have been a possibility. The TV ad would be accurate to say that Blackburn voted for a bill that \u201cwould have eliminated guarantee of maternity coverage,\u201d as Majority Forward\u2019s support for the ad says in pointing to a brief on this issue by the Kaiser Family Foundation. A state would have to decide to eliminate the coverage requirement.", "In the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of the legislation, it\u00a0estimated that about one-third of the U.S. population lives in states that would \u201cmake moderate changes to market regulations\u201d under the bill, and about one-sixth lives in states that would request both\u00a0waivers to change the essential health benefit requirements and to allow pricing based on health status for a limited time for those without continuous coverage.", "Average premiums would decrease, CBO explained, in states that reduced or eliminated the benefit requirements, but out-of-pocket expenses for those who used the eliminated benefits would go up. \u201cIn particular, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the nongroup enrollees who would use those services,\u201d CBO said.", "To mitigate this issue, the House bill included $15 billion in funding to states to be used for maternity coverage, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. And maternity coverage could be sold as an optional rider, as it was before the ACA. Still, CBO said the cost of the rider would cause \u201csubstantially higher out-of-pocket health care costs for pregnant women.\u201d Insurers would \u201cprice that rider at close to the average cost of maternity coverage, which could be more than $1,000 per month,\u201d CBO said. Or they could offer a less expensive rider for limited coverage.", "Like many aspects of the ACA, the essential health benefits requirement mainly affects the individual market, where 7 percent of Americans get their insurance. Employer plans with 15 or more employees are separately required to cover maternity care under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. And even smaller firms have been affected by that law. The Kaiser Family Foundation\u00a0explained that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 broadened the effect of the PDA by forbidding small-group plans, for employers with as few as two employees, from denying coverage to some employees. \u201cThis means small employers not subject to the PDA nonetheless had the opportunity to buy policies with maternity benefits sold to larger employers,\u201d KFF said.", "The woman in the ad has a personal stake in this issue. She is Elizabeth Wanczak, who \u2014 in addition to meeting with Blackburn in her Franklin, Tennessee, office in April 2017, according to Majority Forward \u2014 also attended a town hall meeting hosted by Blackburn in February of that year. The Tennessean\u00a0quoted Wanczak and reported that she said \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t have been able to have her daughter if not for the insurance she found through the federally run health insurance exchange. She came to learn about maternity coverage included in any replacement plan pledged\u00a0by congressional Republicans.\u201d", "Viewers of this ad, however, aren\u2019t getting the whole story on the Republican plan, how it would have worked and who it potentially could have affected.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
