["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on August 14, 2020", "Contrary to claims in viral internet posts, Sen. Kamala Harris did not call former Vice President Joe Biden a \u201cracist\u201d or a \u201crapist.\u201d Rather, she has been critical of Biden\u2019s position on busing to integrate schools and comments he made about segregationist senators, and she has said that she believed women who accused Biden of making them feel uncomfortable.", "Sen. Kamala Harris was critical of former Vice President Joe Biden when the two were among a crowded field of candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination.", "Now that Biden is the presumptive nominee, he has chosen Harris to run as vice president and the statements she made during the primary race are being inaccurately recast.", "One meme that\u2019s been shared thousands of times on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram uses a picture of Harris \u2014 the first Black woman to be named to a major party ticket \u2014 with the claim: \u201cI just accepted a job offer from a man I called a racist and a rapist.\u201d", "She has not used those words to describe Biden.", "In fact, in one instance, Harris specifically said to Biden, \u201cI do not believe you are a racist.\u201d That was in the June 27, 2019, debate during which moderators asked a question about racial inequities in policing. The question grew into a wider discussion of race among the 10 candidates on stage, and Harris directed her remarks to Biden, who was leading in the polls at the time.", "Interestingly, despite Harris\u2019 preface to her comments, the exchange that followed is the primary piece of evidence used by those advancing the claim that Harris called Biden \u201ca racist.\u201d", "On Aug. 11, the day that Biden announced Harris would join his ticket, President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign released a statement that said: \u201cNot long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist.\u201d The same day, the conservative news outlet the Daily Caller tweeted a clip from the debate below this text: \u201cHow nice of him to pick her after she called him a vile racist on the debate stage a little over a year ago.\u201d", "A Trump campaign spokesperson told FactCheck.org that their statement was based on Harris\u2019 comments at the debate and similar comments she made on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and in a press gaggle earlier that month.", "In June 2019, Biden made news for remarks he had recently made at a fundraiser in New York City. That\u2019s what Harris was addressing in the debate.", "At the fundraiser, Biden had\u00a0referenced two segregationist senators with whom he worked after he arrived in the Senate in 1973. \u201cWell, guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn\u2019t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you\u2019re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don\u2019t talk to each other anymore,\u201d Biden said.", "Biden also said that one of the senators called him \u201cson,\u201d rather than \u201cboy,\u201d in an apparent reference to the racist expression that refers to Black men as boys.", "Sen. Cory Booker, who is Black and was seeking the Democratic nomination, also responded to Biden\u2019s remarks at the time.", "Biden apologized the following month during a speech in South Carolina, saying, \u201cNow was I wrong a few weeks ago, to somehow give the impression to people that I was praising those men who I successfully opposed time and again? Yes, I was. I regret it. I\u2019m sorry for any of the pain or misconception that I caused anybody.\u201d", "Harris had described his remarks as \u201churtful\u201d during the debate. She also criticized his record of opposing federally mandated busing to integrate schools, which he defended by arguing that busing policies were better set by local governments. We wrote about the exchange at the time of the debate.", "As for the claim that Harris called Biden \u201ca rapist,\u201d that\u2019s inaccurate, too.", "Some conservative outlets have either made that claim explicitly, as is the case with the Chicks on the Right, or made the claim more suggestively, as is the case with the website, The Post Millennial.", "In either case, they ultimately point to the same article from The Hill in early April 2019. The article ran as several women came forward to publicly accuse Biden of making them feel uncomfortable with unwanted physical contact. Biden hadn\u2019t yet officially entered the race, but there was widespread speculation at the time that he would run. Biden entered the primary later that month.", "More than a dozen other candidates were already running and many responded to the allegations in early April. The article from The Hill featured Harris\u2019 response to the accusations during a campaign stop in Nevada on April 2, 2019.", "Referring to the accusers, Harris reportedly said, \u201cI believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it.\u201d", "None of the allegations at that time included rape.", "About a year later, in March 2020, one of the women expanded on her original allegation and accused Biden of digitally penetrating her. Biden has denied those allegations.", "We could find no comments from Harris since her remarks in early April 2019, which did not involve any accusations of rape. So the claim that she has called Biden a rapist is false.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found\u00a0here.", "Biden, Joe (@JoeBiden). \u201cI have the great honor to announce that I\u2019ve picked @KamalaHarris \u2014 a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants \u2014 as my running mate.\u201d Twitter. 11 Aug 2020.", "Hartigan, Rachel. \u201cAt least 11 women have vied for U.S. vice president.
