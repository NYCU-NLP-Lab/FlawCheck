Martin O'Malley, left, and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. AP Photo/John Locher", "It was the grandest of stages for a former Warwick mayor turned U.S. senator, turned Rhode Island governor, turned presidential candidate.", "Rhode Island\u2019s Lincoln Chafee was in a nationally televised debate Tuesday night with a chance to shine against just four rivals.", "Chafee set out to distinguish himself in his opening statement, making a number of claims we\u2019ve heard before as well as this boast:", "\"I\u2019m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals,\" Chafee said.", "No scandals? Nothing in almost three decades? A bold claim, especially for a Rhode Island politician.", "It\u2019s true Chafee has never been charged, indicted, convicted or imprisoned. During those 30 years, one governor, the mayor of Providence and a gaggle of others have gone to prison.", "But scandal isn\u2019t strictly a legal term. According to the dictionary, a scandal is a public disgrace. We kept that in mind as we reviewed Chafee\u2019s 30 years of public service.", "One story jumped out at us. A controversy about the purchase of frogs \u2014 yes frogs for the mayor\u2019s aquarium \u2014 as well as toboggans, theater tickets, flowers and other items totalling thousands of dollars a year.", "Chafee\u2019s office bought the four frogs, which cost $1.99 each in 1997, and the rest of the stuff with taxpayers\u2019 money from a discretionary account for the Warwick mayor\u2019s office.", "The story blew up in 2000 as Chafee ran to keep his U.S. Senate seat. Chafee said other mayors had used the same account. But, he said, he was the first mayor to keep records on expenses.", "Unimpressed, Chafee\u2019s critics charged he had inappropriately spent taxpayer money. One, mayoral candidate, Michael Woods, the 43-year-old brother of actor James Woods, called for a state police investigation.", "The Journal\u2019s archives include two chapters in Chafee\u2019s life that are more personal.", "For some politicians, college escapades involving cocaine or other narcotics, are fodder for scandal, especially when it\u2019s something that\u2019s concealed initially.", "Chafee\u2019s experience with cocaine was still under wraps in the late \u201990s and when the much anticipated questions finally came, he took pride in his transparent response. He immediately admitted his use of cocaine. And moved on with his career.", "As governor, there was another controversy surrounding the state\u2019s handling of an underage drinking party thrown by Chafee\u2019s 18-year-old son Caleb Chafee on the family\u2019s Exeter property in 2012.", "The younger Chafee pleaded no contest to a criminal charge of violating the social host law; the state police never released the records on their investigation of the governor\u2019s son. Some suggested that this raised questions about the possibility that there was something to hide.", "As governor, Chafee made an appointment in the final days of his administration that critics saw as a violation of the state\u2019s revolving-door law.", "Chafee nominated a top aide and political ally, Richard Licht, for a state judgeship. The state ethics commission allowed the nomination, but critics argued the\u00a0law should have been applied to Licht, the state\u2019s director of administration.", "Finally, in the first six months of the Raimondo administration, revelations about the management of the Department of Transportation and the Department of Children, Youth and Families have raised questions about conduct in those departments under Chafee.", "Our ruling", "In his opening remarks Tuesday night Chafee said: \"I\u2019m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals.\"", "We\u2019re not entirely sure what Chafee considers a scandal. We reached out to Chafee\u2019s spokeswoman to get the candidate\u2019s definition, but she said she would need more time to respond.", "The dictionary again says a scandal is a public disgrace. Over\u00a0the past 30 years, Chafee has had his share of controversy, and an occasional brush with scandal.", "But scandal, a full blown public disgrace? Probably not.", "After all, in the broader scheme of things, is it disgraceful to buy four frogs for $7.96 to amuse visitors to the mayor\u2019s office?", "We rate this claim Mostly True.", "CNN.com, \"Lincoln Chafee: I have had no scandals,\" Oct. 13, 2015, accessed Oct. 14, 2015", "Providence Journal, \"Sen.
