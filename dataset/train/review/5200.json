["President Donald Trump has repeatedly labeled CNN as \"fake news,\" but is it true that Sen. Bernie Sanders agrees with him? That was the message from Trump in an early-morning Twitter take.", "\"While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network,\" Trump tweeted\u00a0Feb. 12. \"They said technical difficulties.\"", "While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!", "Trump is referring to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett\u2019s interview with Sanders, I-Vt., on Feb. 10, a few days before his tweet.", "Trump\u2019s tweet, however, mischaracterized the reality of the Sanders-Burnett exchange. His tweet echoes a post on InfoWars, a website that pushes conspiracy theories.", "Here\u2019s what actually happened.", "Sanders and Burnett were discussing the news that Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn called the Russian ambassador to the United States before the inauguration to discuss easing sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama in retaliation for interference in the election. Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump officials had said in media interviews that Flynn did not discuss the sanctions with Sergey Kislyak.", "A minute into the interview, Burnett played a clip of Trump responding to reporters\u2019 questions on his plane about Flynn\u2019s comments. Trump said, \"I don't know about that, I haven't seen it. What report is that? I haven't seen that, I'll look at that.\"", "After the clip, Burnett asked Sanders if it\u2019s a \"problem\" that the president hasn\u2019t seen the report. That\u2019s when Sanders actually criticized Trump for his tendency to dismiss news outlets\u2019 negative reports as fake news.", "Here\u2019s the back-and-forth:", "Burnett: \"He says he knows nothing about it, hasn't seen any of these reports. Is that a problem?\"", "Sanders: \"Well, I don't know, maybe he was watching CNN fake news, what do you think?\"", "Burnett: \"You don't buy it?\"", "Sanders: \"That was a joke.\"", "Burnett: \"I know it was a joke. I'm saying, you don't buy what he said, obviously?\"", "Sanders\u2019 audio cut out after Burnett acknowledged the joke, so CNN cut to commercial break.", "\"It looks like we've lost connection with Senator Sanders,\" Burnett said. \"So let's just try to get that back up. Do we have him back? OK. So what we're going to do is take a break, I don't want to waste our time, we only have the senator for a few minutes, we're going to take a break, we're going to come back and continue our conversation with Senator Sanders.\"", "Burnett picked up the interview after the break, going on for nine more minutes to ask Sanders about the administration\u2019s contentious travel ban, the Republican plans to replace the Affordable Care Act and Trump\u2019s attacks on Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.", "CNN reporters including Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper also shot back at Trump\u2019s tweet\u00a0misrepresenting the exchange.", "Untrue. Sanders was *criticizing Trump* for calling CNN \"fake news.\" You can see for yourself, all 11 minutes, here: https://t.co/qhtlb5Wo6Q https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j", "From Michael Briggs, Senator Sanders\u2019 Communications Director: \u201cThe Senator was clearly joking\u201d https://t.co/OzMj8pkTlv", "Our ruling", "Trump tweeted, \"While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!\"", "Trump\u2019s tweet distorted what happened when Sanders brought up \"fake news\" on CNN. \u00a0Sanders was actually criticizing Trump\u2019s repeated outcries that CNN is a fake news source. His audio did go out after this joke, but the CNN host picked up the interview after a commercial break for about nine more minutes.", "Trump gave the inaccurate impression that Sanders was booted for calling CNN \"fake news.\" That\u2019s not what happened.
