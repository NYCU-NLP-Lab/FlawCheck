["Recently, a meeting was scheduled by Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee, Ministry of Urban Development on November 15 to address the deteriorating air quality in Delhi. As per a report by India Today, it had to be rescheduled because vice-chairperson of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), commissioners of three municipal zones and several MPs did not turn up, including former cricketer and current member of Lok Sabha, Gautam Gambhir. On the same day, former cricketer VVS Laxman tweeted some pictures of him in Indore with Jatin Sapru and Gambhir, enjoying jalebis.", "Subsequently, there was a backlash on social media against Gambhir with the narrative that he had missed the meeting because he would rather do cricket commentary for the India vs Bangladesh test series. One of them was Aarti Chaddha, a member of Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s social media team, who tweeted a video of Gautam Gambhir. She tweeted, \u201cPeople of Delhi; Listen to what your MP is saying \u2013 a meeting on Pollution is necessary or Cricket Commentary? Next time you think twice before voting on a celebrity.\u201d", "In the eight-second video, a reporter from ANI questions, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you turn up for the meeting?\u201d to which Gambhir responds \u201cIs the meeting important or my work important? In the past five mo..\u201d", "Delhiites ; Listen what your MP is asking \u2013 Pollution \u092a\u0930 \u092c\u0948\u0920\u0915 \u091c\u093c\u0930\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u093e Cricket Commentary ? \u00d7\u00d7 Next time, before Voting for Celebs, Think Twice ! pic.twitter.com/NTaqRUg1bq", "\u2014 Aarti (@aartic02) November 18, 2019", "Here, Gautam Gambhir\u2019s words \u201cIs the meeting important or my work\u201d has been interpreted as Gambhir saying his personal commitments are more important than a meeting on discussing pollution. \u2018Work\u2019 has been construed as work in personal capacity.", "The video has also been posted by national media coordinator of AAP, Vikas Yogi. He tweeted with the words, \u201cJalebi or meeting?\u201d", "\u091c\u0932\u0947\u092c\u0940 \u092f\u093e \u092c\u0948\u0920\u0915 ? @GautamGambhir pic.twitter.com/BGrs91xoCa", "\u2014 Vikas Yogi (@vikaskyogi) November 18, 2019", "The video in question is real. However, it just shows eight-seconds from a 90-second interview given to ANI on November 18. Additionally, the video is misrepresented because the phrase \u2018my work\u2019 is being portrayed as Gambhir\u2019s personal work. The narrative on social media aims to show that Gambhir has said his personal work or business contract is more important than his duties as an MP.", "#WATCH: Gautam Gambhir, BJP MP says.\u201dAgar mera jalebi khane se Delhi ka pollution badha hai, toh main hamesha ke liye jalebi chhod sakta hoon\u202610 minute mein mujhe troll karna shuru kar diya, agar itni mehnat Delhi ki pollution ko kam karne mein ki hoti toh hum saas le pate.\u201d pic.twitter.com/K2oW5qokht", "\u2014 ANI (@ANI) November 18, 2019", "In the original video, Gambhir says, \u201cIs the meeting important or my work important? I have listed the work I have done in the past five months. Please look at the work done over the past five years by them (referring to the AAP government). I have informed them (Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee) via email on November 11, that I will not be able to attend the meeting because of contractual obligations. It is not like I informed them (the committee) on November 13. Instead of trolling me, if they (AAP government) had worked on addressing the issue of air pollution we would be breathing properly.\u201d", "The video in question has been deliberately clipped. As a result, when Gambhir says \u201cIs the meeting important or my work\u201d, the viewers do not know the full context. As a result, a false narrative was built on social media. After listening to the complete interview, it is clear that Gambhir was referring to parliamentary work and not what is sought to be projected.", "In conclusion, a clipped video of Gautam Gambhir was circulated on social media in order to portray him as indifferent to the issue of pollution in the national capital.", "Donate Now", "Priyanka Jha specialises in monitoring and researching mis/disinformation at Alt News.
