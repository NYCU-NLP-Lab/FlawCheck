["A set of two photographs of the Jammu and Kashmir civil secretariat building is floating across social media platforms. While the image on the top shows both the Indian flag and the flag of J&K hoisted on the building, the image on the bottom shows only the Indian flag. It attempts to suggest that the state flag has been removed from the civil secretariat building. Indian wrestler Geeta Phogat was among those who shared the images.
