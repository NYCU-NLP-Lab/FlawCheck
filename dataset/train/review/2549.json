["About this rating", "A set of images purportedly showing Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 in a bikini were widely circulated on social media in July 2018, as the country's football team advanced to the World Cup final (which they ended up losing to France):", "The bottom two images in this photoset truly do show the Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107. The top three, however, feature an entirely different woman: American model Coco Austin at a Miami beach in 2009.", "Although the Coco Austin images were the ones most widely spread in accompaniment of this errant claim, this wasn't the only time that pictures of a bikini-clad woman have been misidentified as photographs of the Croatian President. A second image showing a woman in a blue bikini has also been shared as if it captured Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 at the beach:", "Again, the woman in this picture is not the Croatian president.", "This image is part of a larger set of photographs that was included in a 2014 gallery on a porn website:", "These images appear to have originated with a set of vacation photographs taken by a private citizen, whom we will not identify here for privacy reasons.", "None of these photographs truly shows Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 in a bikini. However, for those who are simply desperate to see a national leader in swimwear, at least one photograph of the Croatian president in a swimsuit amay be genuine. In January 2015, an picture purportedly showing Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 on vacation was published on the cover of the the magazine 24 Sata Express:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
