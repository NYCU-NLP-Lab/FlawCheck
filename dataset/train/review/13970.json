["By Robert Farley", "Posted on July 23, 2020", "Experts say there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter protests or Mexicans have caused the spike in coronavirus cases in pockets of the U.S., contradicting President Donald Trump\u2019s assertions.", "In a press briefing on July 21, Trump acknowledged cases were rising in some parts of the country and, \u201cIt will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.\u201d In another press briefing the following day, Trump noted that cases are rising in parts of the South and Southwest and the West. Trump offered this assessment of the reasons why:", "Trump, July 22: There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations \u2014 which you know very well about \u2014 which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.", "Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places \u2014 maybe beaches \u2014 four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide \u2014 likely also contributed.", "We\u2019re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the president, and it\u2019s a big problem for Mexico. But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.", "Despite Trump mentioning the protests that followed the death of George Floyd and cases rising in Mexico, experts told us there is no evidence either of those is responsible for the spike in cases around the country. Rather, they said, it is a result of some states reopening too quickly or aggressively, without proper measures in place to test, trace and isolate cases, and people generally socializing in ways that epidemiologists had warned would result in the spread of the virus.", "Many epidemiologists feared that the protests in honor of Floyd \u2014 a Black man who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25\u00a0 \u2014 would trigger a jump in coronavirus cases.", "Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us in a phone interview that he was concerned about large groups of protesters in close quarters screaming and chanting, and in some cases hit with tear gas that would make them cough \u2014 things that can contribute to virus spread. But the feared spike in infections never panned out, he said.", "\u201cThere has been no evidence that protests led to a significant increase in infections,\u201d Adalja said.", "While there have been some cases that have emerged among law enforcement in particular, he said, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been very big.\u201d Any increase, he said, \u201chas been minimal, at best.\u201d", "\u201cIt really hasn\u2019t had a significant impact on the increases we\u2019re seeing in certain states,\u201d he said.", "Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch concurs.", "\u201cTo my knowledge there is no evidence that the spike in cases can be attributed to protests,\u201d Lipsitch told us via email. \u201cWhile I and other epidemiologists have noted the likelihood that some transmissions would likely occur at protests, my understanding is that when testing facilities were opened for those who had been at large gatherings, positivity was very low or even zero among those who came \u2014 probably because the protests were outdoors and largely masked.\u201d", "In a June working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists concluded there was \u201cno evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset.\u201d The paper, which is not peer-reviewed, further concluded \u201cpredictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.\u201d", "The researchers said their analysis of 315 U.S. cities provided \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that as a result of protests, non-protesters generally stayed home more, resulting in a net benefit with regard to spread of the coronavirus.", "\u201cEvent-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non-protesters\u2019 behavior was substantially affected by urban protests,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThis effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence.\u201d", "Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center, told us via email he was \u201cnot aware of evidence that outdoors protests have fueled COVID outbreaks to a significant degree.\u201d", "Nor did the experts we contacted believe there is any validity to Trump\u2019s assertion that Mexico has contributed to the rise of cases in the U.S.", "\u201cThe role of Mexican migrants is utterly without foundation, and surely can\u2019t explain upsurges in the Southeast, Northern California, and many other parts of the country,\u201d Lipsitch told us.", "On March 21, Mexico and the U.S. jointly restricted nonessential land travel between the two countries to prevent spread of the coronavirus. Nonessential travel includes travel that is considered tourism or recreation. At least one Mexican state completely closed its border with the U.S. ahead of the July 4 holiday, fearing spread of the virus from the U.S. into Mexico.", "Statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that apprehensions of people crossing the Mexican border illegally into the U.S. have been relatively low in the first half of 2020 compared with 2019.", "Trump suggested that a rise in coronavirus cases in the Southwest may be due, in part, to the U.S. sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico \u2014 where he said cases are \u201csurging.\u201d But Adalja said that is likely \u201cmere coincidence,\u201d considering that states like Florida, Delaware and some in the Midwest are not border states, and yet have also seen spikes in coronavirus infections.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that Mexico has anything to do with case increases and hospitalization increases in those areas [along the border],\u201d Adalja said. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of that.\u201d", "\u201cIt is possible that some infected people may cross borders, but that could probably work in both directions,\u201d Goodman told us. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not aware it is a significant contributor to the U.S. upswing which has generally correlated with relaxation of social distancing.\u201d", "Several of the things mentioned by Trump were contributors to the spike in coronavirus cases around the country, experts said, such as people ignoring social distancing recommendations and gathering in bars, and people traveling more for vacation.", "The main reason for the spike is fairly obvious, Adalja told us.", "\u201cThe virus never went anywhere,\u201d he said. When the stay-at-home orders were lifted, it was inevitable that there would be spread.", "People began to interact. They went to bars. They gathered at events, often not wearing masks.", "The increase was predictable, he said, especially since some states had not prepared the necessary infrastructure to do proper testing, tracing and isolation to control outbreaks.", "\u201cWhat has consistently been clear is that the most stringent control measures have been in the Northeast and these have been the states with the best control over case and death numbers; government policies and individual decisions about reopening and not masking are clearly the main causes of upsurges in the U.S.,\u201d Lipsitch said.", "Not mentioned by Trump is the belief among many scientists \u2014 including some on the president\u2019s own task force \u2014 that some states opened too quickly and aggressively.", "\u201cYeah, then there are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a FiveThirtyEight podcast on July 9.", "Fauci also attributed the spike to a general attitude among some U.S. residents, \u201cYou know, well, I\u2019m either going to be locked down or I\u2019m going to let it all rip.\u201d", "In a press gaggle on July 22, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said \u201csome of these states blew through our gated criteria, blew through our phases, and they opened up some of the industries a little too quickly, like bars.\u201d", "Conway then engaged in revisionist history when she added, \u201cSo remember, the governors wanted complete latitude over when they would open their states. They pushed back heavily, handsomely, Republicans and Democrats, when it was falsely rumored that the president was going to be in charge of opening the states. He\u2019s a federalist. He believes in states\u2019 rights.\u201d", "In fact, Trump was a strong cheerleader for reopening, and repeatedly \u2014 and wrongly \u2014 claimed that he, not governors, had the ultimate authority to open up states.", "In April, Trump admonished Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for opening \u201ctoo soon.\u201d But he also chastised states with Democratic governors who he thought were being too strict, calling via Twitter to \u201cLIBERATE\u201d Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia.", "He has also praised the reopening efforts by some Republican governors, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who he said has done a \u201cfantastic job\u201d responding to the coronavirus, even as Fauci singled out Florida for \u201cjump[ing] over a couple of checkpoints\u201d and opening too quickly. On July 23, Florida broke its record for the highest single-day death toll.", "The U.S. has now had 4 million people test positive for COVID-19 \u2013 including 1 million in the last 15 days, as the COVID Tracking Project data shows. For the second straight day, the U.S. recorded more than 1,100 daily deaths, on July 22 and 23, and now has had more than 143,000 total deaths.", "Epidemiologists say there are a number of reasons for the recent spike in cases around the country, but there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter protests and a surge of cases in Mexico have been major contributors.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
