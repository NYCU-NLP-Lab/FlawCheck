["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on November 15, 2018", "The Republican National Committee and others have taken to claiming that the number of job openings exceeds the number of job seekers for the first time \u201cin history,\u201d a sweeping claim that is without factual support, and likely false.", "It\u2019s true that the number of unfilled job openings is now greater than the number of unemployed people for the first time on record, but records only go back 18 years. Despite what some GOP spinmeisters would have you believe, \u201chistory\u201d didn\u2019t start in December of 2000.", "That\u2019s when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began its\u00a0Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.\u00a0And\u00a0BLS says, \u201cPrior to JOLTS, there was no economic indicator of the unmet demand for labor with which to assess the presence or extent of labor shortages in the United States. \u201d", "Make no mistake, it\u2019s remarkable when job openings exceed the number of jobless, as happened back in March, and several times since. And\u00a0we noted that\u00a0at the top of our July 11 update of \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers.\u201d", "But that fact has evolved into an economic fairy tale as Republicans have made progressively more sweeping boasts about it.", "A week after our report, on July 18, President Donald Trump declared at a White House event, \u201cJob openings exceed the number of unemployed people in our country for the first time in recorded history.\u201d", "Trump didn\u2019t mention that \u201crecorded\u201d history only goes back 18 years in this case. His use of the word \u201crecorded\u201d is a good example of a \u201cweasel word\u201d \u2014\u00a0a qualifier that sucks the meaning out of a phrase in the way that weasels supposedly suck the contents out of an egg.", "But one week later, on July 26, Trump stood by at an Iowa event while Republican Rep. Rod Blum dropped that qualifier and said flatly, \u201cSo the first time \u2014 the first time, my friends, in our country\u2019s history, we have more job openings \u2014 more job openings than we have workers to fill them. First time in our country\u2019s history.\u201d", "And more recently, on Oct. 31, Trump stood by again while his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump also dropped the qualifier once more and said, \u201cAnd for the first time in history, we have more vacant jobs than we have unemployed workers to fill them.\u201d", "There\u2019s no data to support that claim, and good reason to think it is false. During the Korean War, for example, the unemployment rate was at or below the current 3.7 percent for all of 1951, 1952 and the first 11 months of 1953. It reached 2.5 percent in May and June 1953.", "So we know there was a smaller share of people seeking work then than now. Could that be true if there were not plenty of unfilled job openings as well? We don\u2019t think so.", "Even earlier, during World War II, the demand for wartime workers drew women into the workforce in previously unimagined numbers, and into previously all-male jobs. \u201cRosie the Riveter\u201d might well have been as skeptical of Ivanka Trump\u2019s claim as we are.", "And what of the booming economy of the \u201cRoaring 20s,\u201d when by some estimates unemployment dropped to 2.9 percent, much lower than today?", "Yet this GOP talking point lives on, as in this Nov. 13 mis-tweet from the Republican National Committee, grandly claiming that job openings exceed job seekers \u201cfor the first time in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d It\u2019s unsupported, and probably false.", "\u201cOur nation currently boasts more than seven million open jobs \u2014 more than the entire population of the state of Massachusetts. For the first time in our nation\u2019s history, there is more than one job opening for every American who\u2019s looking for work.\u201d \u2013@senatemajldr", "\u2014 GOP (@GOP) November 13, 2018", "If Republicans wish to be factual when boasting about the economy, they should stick to saying job openings exceed job seekers for the first time \u201con record,\u201d and drop the grand claims about \u201chistory.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
