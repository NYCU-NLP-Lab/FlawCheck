["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The top Democrat in the Georgia Senate recently made his case that his party has the better plan to revitalize the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe proposal by Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson included an interesting claim about Georgia\u2019s finances that we wanted to fact-check.\n\n\"State revenue projections have missed the mark month after month,\" Henson, a veteran lawmaker from DeKalb County, said in a news release.\n\nLiz Flowers, who wrote the news release, explained to us what Henson meant. State budget officials projected revenue collected by Georgia\u2019s government would increase by almost 5 percent during the 12-month fiscal year that will end June 30, said Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democratic Caucus. \n\nHenson\u2019s point is there have been several months in which the state fell below the 5 percent mark. While Georgia lawmakers did not make monthly revenue estimates, Henson believes it is fair to examine revenue on a monthly basis by the 5 percent benchmark, noting that the state\u2019s finances are tracked on a monthly basis.\n\n\"It wouldn\u2019t make sense to check our state budget only annually,\" Henson said.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers passed a budget this year that they expected to collect about $19.2 billion in total revenue for this fiscal year. The overwhelming bulk of state revenue comes from property, sales and income taxes. About $1 billion of that money comes from lottery sales and other sources, which are directed to specific state programs. The $18.2 billion in projected general revenue is a 4.9 percent increase from the prior fiscal year, which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s estimated increase for the current fiscal year was higher than most states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Economists say Georgia\u2019s economy is growing, which they attribute to an increase in information technology, business services, manufacturing and transportation jobs.\n\nEach month, Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s office releases a breakdown of total taxes and revenue the state collected the prior month. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nJuly 2012: up 7.4 percent.\nAugust 2012: up 1.9 percent.\nSeptember 2012: up 3.9 percent.\nOctober 2012: up 6.4 percent.\nNovember 2012: down 0.7 percent.\nDecember 2012: up 9.8 percent.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s revenue increased less than 5 percent in three of those six months, according to those estimates. The monthly breakdowns do not explain why state revenue was lower during some months. Through those six months, state officials estimate they have collected about $8.5 billion in total taxes and other revenue, a 4.9 percent increase over the same period in the prior fiscal year. \n\nThe state\u2019s fiscal economist, Ken Heaghney, told a joint committee of Georgia lawmakers on Jan. 22 that tax collections are projected to increase by 3.9 percent for the rest of this fiscal year. \n\nHenson said the state\u2019s latest estimate of a 3.9 percent increase for the remainder of the fiscal year also validates his argument.\n\n\"In 2012, Georgia's revenue projections remained low for nearly half the year. A spike to 9 percent in December made up ground in the governor's revenue projections,\" Henson said.\n\nTo sum up, the senator claimed \"state revenue projections have missed the mark month after month.\" Revenue increased less than 5 percent in three of the six months so far this fiscal year. The state, though, doesn\u2019t do monthly revenue projections, and Georgia is on pace to increase its revenue by almost 5 percent from the prior fiscal year. \n\nTechnically, there\u2019s accuracy in Henson\u2019s statement, but there\u2019s also some important context missing.
