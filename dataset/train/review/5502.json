Combined\u00a0with general population growth, and this election had 27 million more participants.", "The statistic on counties comes from a report by\u00a0the\u00a0Brookings Institution on Nov. 10.\u00a0It's true that the report first showed Biden at 477 counties and\u00a0Trump at 2,497 counties, though it\u00a0has since been updated to show\u00a0Biden at 509 and\u00a0Trump at 2,547.", "But county wins don't correlate with the popular vote, in part due to tremendous\u00a0variance\u00a0in population size and density by county.", "More than half of all Americans live\u00a0in just 143 counties, per the U.S. Census Bureau.", "A\u00a0single county could have as few as 88 residents,\u00a0like Kalawao County, Hawaii. Or it\u00a0could have almost 10.1 million residents, like Los Angeles County.", "For that reason,\u00a0Rogers M. Smith, a political scientist\u00a0at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reuters\u00a0that \"focusing on counties won as an indicator of the likely popular vote winner makes no sense whatsoever.\"", "\"Biden did well in virtually all of the most populous counties in the U.S., which, along with a larger electorate explains why he defeated Donald Trump by over 7 million votes, despite carrying many fewer counties,\" Smith wrote.", "(Biden, for example, won over 70%\u00a0of the vote in Los Angeles County.)", "Fact check: Biden won the most total votes \u2013 and the fewest total counties \u2013\u00a0of any president-elect", "First, what are bellwether counties?\u00a0From 1980 through 2016, there were\u00a019 counties that consistently voted for the eventual president.

But those states represent just 29, 18\u00a0and six electoral votes, respectively.", "Even combined, they represent only\u00a053 votes \u2014 a fraction of the 538 total electoral votes\u00a0or the 270 electoral votes required to win the White House.", "As long as a candidate wins enough electoral votes from other states, there is no\u00a0reason it's impossible to win an election while losing Florida, Ohio, or Iowa.", "It's happened before.
