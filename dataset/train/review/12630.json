["Actor Samuel L. Jackson has had a storied career, starring in movies like Pulp Fiction and Glass. Is he now taking aim at another creative industry?", "\"Maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s-----\u00a0music,\" reads what looks like a screenshot of a tweet posted to Facebook on March 21. The post makes it look like the Twitter account that tweeted the statement was Jackson\u2019s (handle: @SamuelLJackson).", "This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "It\u2019s true that Jackson is on Twitter, and @SamuelLJackson is his verified account. The profile photo on the account is also the photo that appears in the Facebook post. Recently, he tweeted about the forthcoming Avengers and posted a Capital One commercial.", "But after searching Twitter, we couldn\u2019t find the supposed tweet that was posted to Facebook. We couldn\u2019t find any tweets mentioning music and teachers, either.", "One user made it look like she was retweeting Jackson by using his handle and the letters \"RT,\" meaning retweet, but she didn\u2019t include a link to an original tweet. (She could have just as easily tweeted: \"RT @realDonaldTrump Maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s-----\u00a0music.\")", "When another account asked if he really said that, she only replied: \"Judging from all the tweets I saw, yes, lmao.\"", "We didn\u2019t see any tweets from the actor himself. And though it\u2019s plausible that he could have tweeted and then deleted the statement, it\u2019s less likely erasing such a statement would have escaped public scrutiny. We didn\u2019t find any news coverage suggesting that Jackson ever shared this opinion, or that he tweeted and then deleted it. (By contrast, in 2018, Jackson came under fire for a legitimate tweet he made that some criticized as homophobic.)", "Last summer, one user on the website Quora tried to solve the quotation mystery but turned up empty when he requested any sources or links.", "\"This was a fake post on Twitter,\" another user said.", "Searching online for the quote and Jackson turned up plenty of posts, but none credible enough for us to endorse this Facebook claim.", "In the absence of evidence, we\u00a0rate this post False.", "Facebook post, March 21, 2019", "Samuel L.
