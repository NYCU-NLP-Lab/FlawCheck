["As the father of five young adults, Gov. Bob McDonnell says he feels the pain of rising college tuition.\n\n\"The average kid comes out of Virginia colleges with about $25,000 plus in debt, and that\u2019s just not acceptable long-term,\" he said during a Dec. 6 news conference.\n\nNo doubt, a college education is expensive. But we wondered if the governor\u2019s debt figure is correct.\n\nPaul Logan, a McDonnell spokesman, said his boss\u2019s statement is based on data in an October 2012 report by the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit group that annually examines the debt loads of graduates.\n\nThe study tallied the average student debt in each state for the 2010-2011 academic year. Among Virginia graduates who had taken out loans, the average debt was $24,717, ranking 23rd highest in the nation.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty close to McDonnell\u2019s number, but there\u2019s a major caveat: that figure only averages the debt of students who took out loans. It does not take into account those who were fortunate enough to graduate without debt.\n\nThe institute\u2019s figures show that 59 percent of Virginia students graduated with debt and 41 percent did not.\n\nThe group\u2019s website said the average debt among Virginia graduates who got bachelor degrees during the 2010-11 school year was $14,628.\n\nThe debt data comes from answers colleges provide to a survey by Peterson\u2019s, a college guide publishing company. Peterson\u2019s survey, which looks at students graduating from four-year public universities and private nonprofit colleges, was answered by 55 percent of colleges and universities that awarded bachelor\u2019s degrees in the 2010-2011 school year.\n\nThe institute says there are limitations to the figures it uses in its report. Very few for-profit colleges report figures on student debt, and those schools typically generate high borrowing, the report says. And because the data is provided voluntarily, colleges \"may actually have a disincentive for honest and full reporting,\" the study says. The group also says that colleges may not be aware of the full private loan debt held borne by their graduates.\n\nDespite those concerns, the institute says the Peterson survey is the only data that allows analysis of student debt among bachelors\u2019 degrees recipients.\n\nOne final note: Student loans by no means encompass all the money borrowed for college. In 2011, the federal government disbursed $10.6 billion in Parent Plus loans to just under 1 million families, according to a report by ProPublica and The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcDonnell said the average student graduating from Virginia colleges is about $25,000 in debt.\n\nThe study he cites says that\u2019s the level of debt among students who have taken out loans.\n\nBut McDonnell omits a key point. The average he cited doesn\u2019t count a large number of students who graduated debt free. When they are included, the average is $14,628.\n\nSo we rate his claim Half True.", "Gov.
