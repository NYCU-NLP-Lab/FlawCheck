["By Eugene Kiely and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on April 26, 2018", "President Donald Trump claimed a memo that former FBI Director James Comey gave to a friend \u201cin order to get a special counsel against me\u201d was \u201call classified \u2026 totally classified.\u201d That\u2019s wrong. It was unclassified at the time and remains unclassified.", "In an April 26 interview on Fox News,\u00a0Trump also claimed Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, \u201cdidn\u2019t even spend\u201d and \u201ckept some of\u201d the nearly $700,000 that her 2015 state Senate campaign received from political groups affiliated with Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend of Hillary Clinton.", "In fact, campaign records show that the money was spent on campaign-related expenses and contributions.", "Trump\u2019s phone call to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d came only hours after CNN broadcast a town hall meeting with Comey, the former FBI director who was fired by Trump during the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. Steve Doocy, a co-host of the show, asked Trump about his opinion of Comey, who is on a book tour to promote \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d which is critical of Trump.", "The president said he watched Comey\u2019s televised town hall event and criticized the former FBI director for \u201cleaking\u201d what he called \u201cclassified information.\u201d", "Trump, April 26: Look, Comey is a leaker and he\u2019s a liar and not only on this stuff. He\u2019s been leaking for years.", "He\u2019s probably been using his friend, the so-called professor who now turns out to have FBI clearance, which he never said. He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress.", "He said he gave it to a friend and he gave it to a friend to leak classified information. It\u2019s all classified. It was totally classified.", "So illegally \u2014 he did an illegal act and he said it himself in order to get a special counsel against me.", "Trump is right about one thing: Comey acknowledged at a June 8, 2017, Senate hearing that he gave a memo to Columbia law professor Daniel Richman with instructions that he provide some of the information contained in the memo to the New York Times. Comey said he did so with the hope that it \u201cmight prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d", "Comey wrote that memo\u00a0on the day of a Feb. 14, 2017, meeting with Trump at the White House. Comey writes in the memo that Trump brought up the\u00a0FBI investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn when they met. \u201cHe said, \u2018I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go\u2019,\u201d Comey recalled Trump saying.", "But Trump is incorrect when he says that the memo contained classified information.", "The Feb. 14, 2017, memo was one of\u00a0seven memos\u00a0that Comey wrote about his encounters with Trump. The Department of Justice last week sent all seven to Congress \u2014 four of them contained some level of classified information, but not the one dated Feb. 14, 2017, that was given to Richman. That memo was labeled \u201cunclassified//FOUO.\u201d As explained by the National Archives and Records Administration, FOUO stands for \u201cfor official use only,\u201d which is one of several markings used by some federal agencies for documents\u00a0\u201crequiring a degree of control\u201d but \u201cdo\u00a0not\u00a0designate classified national security information.\u201d", "It was also unclassified at the time that Comey gave the memo to Richman.\u00a0In the memo, Comey writes: \u201cNOTE: because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next.\u201d", "At the CNN town hall event, Comey reiterated that the memo he gave Richman was unclassified and he noted that Richman relayed the \u201csubstance\u201d of the memo to the Times, but not the memo itself.\u00a0\u201cI sent one memo unclassified then, still unclassified and it\u2019s recounted in my book, to my friend Dan Richman and asked him to get the substance of it but not the memo out to the media,\u201d he said.", "Comey also disputed Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201cleak\u201d when referring to the Feb. 14, 2017, memo. Asked if he leaked the memo, Comey said, \u201cWell, not to get tangled up in it but I think of a leak as an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\u00a0That\u2019s how I thought about it as FBI director; we investigated leaks.\u201d", "Trump didn\u2019t make this point in his interview with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d but Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has questioned whether Comey mishandled the classified information that was contained in four of the seven memos.", "In a Jan. 3 letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Grassley said Comey gave Richman four of the seven memos. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that Professor Richman had four of the seven memos, then in light of the fact that four of the seven memos the Committee reviewed are classified, it would appear that at least one memo the former FBI director gave Professor Richman contained classified information,\u201d Grassley wrote.", "The senator\u2019s office told us that Grassley is not accusing Comey of leaking classified information, but is trying to get to the bottom of Comey\u2019s handling of the memos. A staffer, who asked not to be identified, said the office could not discuss Rosenstein\u2019s response to Grassley\u2019s letter. The staffer also said the senator\u2019s office has yet to hear from Comey.", "On CNN, Comey confirmed that he gave Richman copies of four memos. However, he claimed that all four were unclassified.", "\u201cAfter I was fired I put together a legal team with three people, one of whom was Professor Dan Richman at Columbia University,\u201d Comey said on CNN. \u201cAfter I had asked him to give this information to the media I separately gave my legal team four memos which were unclassified.\u201d", "Comey said as director of the FBI he had \u201cthe training and the authority to make decisions about what should be classified and what shouldn\u2019t,\u201d and that he decided that only three of the memos contained classified information.", "When the memos were made public, however, four of them had markings indicating they contained classified information\u00a0\u2014 so one of the memos was\u00a0\u201cup-classified,\u201d which refers to information that is retroactively deemed classified when documents are reviewed for public release. (Comey popularized the term \u201cup-classified\u201d when he used it during the FBI investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information while secretary of state.)", "At this point, we don\u2019t know if Comey mishandled any classified information. But we do know that the president is wrong when he said the memo Comey gave to Richman \u201cin order to get a special counsel against me\u201d was \u201call classified \u2026 totally classified.\u201d That memo was not classified.", "Update, Aug. 29, 2019: The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General issued a report Aug. 29 that said Comey gave a copy of one memo (identified as \u201cmemo 4\u201d) to Richman with instructions to share the contents of the memo with a reporter. The FBI determined that memo 4 \u201cdid not contain classified information.\u201d", "\u201cWe found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media,\u201d the report said.", "The IG did, however, find that the former FBI director \u201cviolated applicable policies and his FBI Employment Agreement\u201d by keeping \u201csigned originals of Memos 2, 4, 6, and 7\u201d at his home after leaving the FBI, and then sharing \u201ccopies of Memos 2, 4, and 6, and a redacted version of Memo 7\u201d with his attorney.", "One of those shared copies, memo 2, contained six words that the FBI later determined to be classified at the \u201cconfidential\u201d level \u2013 the \u201clowest level\u201d of government secrecy. The redacted version of memo 7 did not contain classified information, and Comey did not take home or share memos 1 and 3, which contained classified information at the \u201csecret\u201d level.", "The Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey for mishandling classified information, the IG report says.", "In his interview, Trump also said without evidence that Jill McCabe, wife of the former FBI deputy director, \u201cdidn\u2019t even spend\u201d and \u201ckept some of\u201d the nearly $700,000 that her Virginia Senate campaign received from a Hillary Clinton supporter in 2015.", "In fact, campaign finance reports filed with the Virginia Department of Elections show that Jill McCabe\u2019s campaign spent all of the nearly $1.7 million it raised for her race. So, there were no leftover funds for the McCabes to keep.", "Trump, April 26: You look at McCabe where he takes $700,000 from somebody supporting Hillary Clinton. He takes $700,000 for his wife\u2019s campaign. And by the way, didn\u2019t even spend that money. They kept some of it because under that law you\u2019re \u2014 he took seven.", "As we\u2019ve written before, Jill McCabe unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia state Senate seat in 2015. Her campaign reported receiving a total of $1.67 million, including $467,500 from Common Good VA and $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party.", "Common Good VA is the political action committee of former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend and supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Combined, McAuliffe\u2019s PAC and the Virginia Democratic Party contributed $675,000 to McCabe\u2019s campaign.", "We asked the White House what evidence Trump had that the McCabes \u201ckept some of\u201d the campaign money, but did not receive a response.\u00a0We will update this story if we do.", "Jill McCabe\u2019s campaign actually spent all of the money it raised in 2015, according to a summary of its finances by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.", "As of Nov. 26, 2015, which was more than 3 weeks after the Nov. 3 election, McCabe\u2019s campaign reported a balance of just $13,085.49, according to the financial report it filed on Dec. 3, 2015.", "Its follow-up report on March 28, 2016, (see Schedule D) shows that a good chunk of the remaining money was used to pay staff salaries and donate to other Democratic candidates and committees. There were also payments for services such as email, internet and banking. The largest single payment we saw was $4,000 to Vaquero Blue LLC, a Democratic direct mail firm headed by former McCabe campaign manager, Scott Remley.", "And the campaign\u2019s final financial report \u2014 which was also filed on March 28, 2016, and disclosed an ending balance of $0 \u2014 says that its last two expenditures were campaign contributions. On Feb. 29, 2016, the campaign donated $1,000 to Democrat LuAnn Bennett, who lost her bid for Congress\u00a0in 2016, and it donated $471.33 to Democratic Lt. Governor Ralph Northam, who won his 2017 race to succeed McAuliffe as governor.", "So, McCabe had no leftover campaign funds to keep, according to state election records.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
