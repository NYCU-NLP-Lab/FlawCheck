One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"", "This video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.", "The video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"", "Here's the original video:", "While the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.", "Mbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video.
