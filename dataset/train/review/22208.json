The company\u2019s president said the layoffs would number more than 1,000.", "TC Energy estimated in October that the pipeline would employ 11,000 Americans in 2021, generating more than $1.6 billion in wages.", "The pipeline provided far fewer permanent jobs.", "President Joe Biden spent his first day in the White House signing a spate of executive orders aimed at undoing the policies of the Trump administration. One of them sparked outrage on Facebook over its effect on American jobs.", "On Jan. 20, Biden signed an order that revoked the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. In a Facebook post published the same day, one user said the move would cost thousands of jobs.", "\"By revoking the Keystone pipeline permit, Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs and roughly $2 billion in wages,\" the post says. \"Democrats couldn\u2019t even get through Day 1 without killing jobs for middle class Americans.\"", "The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

And the project has become a symbol for the political debate over fossil fuels.", "The Obama-era State Department had denied TC Energy\u2019s request for a permit in 2015. Trump revived hopes for the project once he took office, ultimately approving it with an executive order. Construction began in April 2020, but that same month, a federal court said that the project had to go through a full endangered species review. TC Energy appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court upheld it in July.", "Before Biden signed his executive order, only a 1.2-mile section of the pipeline had been completed in Montana near the U.S.-Canada border.", "Over the past several years, we\u2019ve fact-checked many claims that the Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of American jobs.

Since the State Department defines \"job\" as \"one position that is filled for 1 year,\" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period.", "In short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary.", "The State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline.
