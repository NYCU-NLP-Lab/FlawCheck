However, not every incident meets the definition of an outbreak. In places such as England, Italy and Russia, some people caught it in their labs. A strain of the virus infected some pigs in the Philippines and some workers there developed antibodies but never showed any symptoms. There were instances where just a single person died.\u00a0If you discount exposures in the laboratory, infections of animals, you are left with 19 outbreaks before the current one.
