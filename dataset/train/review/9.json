The resulting video, he said, looks like a lip sync.", "\"I believe that the Instagram video is a so-called lip sync deepfake in which Zuckerberg\u2019s mouth has been resynthesized to be consistent with a new audio track. I believe that this new audio track is itself synthesized most likely from a system that learned to synthesize speech from previous recordings of Zuckerberg,\" Farid wrote in an email. \"This is not a particularly good fake and there are clear artifacts on the audio and video.\"", "PolitiFact reached out to Facebook for comment about this video clip, but we did not get a response before publication.
