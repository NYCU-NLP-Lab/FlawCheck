Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stirred our curiosity when he asserted that certain rich Americans would face increased taxes off the bat.", "\"By the way,\" Cruz said in Senate debate Dec. 19, 2017, \"there is one subset of people whose taxes will go up under this, the rich people in high-tax Democratic states. The irony of all the high dudgeon from our Democratic friends pounding the table about \u2018this is a tax cut for the rich,\u2019 the only people whose taxes are going up are the really rich,\" Cruz said.", "Cruz, seeking re-election in 2018, was even more specific, saying: \"The middle class, their taxes are all going down. The working class, their taxes are going down. Every taxpayer, their taxes are going down,\" Cruz said, \"except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco. Some of them, their taxes may go up.\"", "We unsuccessfully queried Cruz about how he reached his conclusion about higher taxes solely hitting plump cats in the Big Apple and The City (which--honest--is what San Francisco residents call their town).", "To be sure, studies of the plan signed into law by President Donald Trump suggest that many wealthy Americans will see tax cuts--while some will pay more. We didn\u2019t confirm, though, that those likely paying more live only in San Francisco and Manhattan. But\u00a0experts told us wealthier workers in high-tax states and cities are at risk of higher tabs in the main because the law limits to $10,000 how much anyone may deduct in state and local income taxes.", "Two studies signal plan\u2019s 'winners, losers'", "Toward the end of 2017, PolitiFact in Washington looked at impact studies of the adopted tax plan by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan group that analyzes tax bills for Congress, and the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation.", "According to the committee, taxpayers stand to enjoy reductions in 2019 (the first year of its analysis) with the average tax rate decreasing in each of 11 income groupings. Yet not everyone is projected to see lower taxes every year. In 2027, the committee\u2019s analysis says, taxpayers earning up to $75,000 a year would face average tax rates higher than what they faced under existing law with people in higher brackets still paying less than they would if the law hadn\u2019t changed.", "Why the big changes before 2027? The primary reason is that the law phases out some of the individual tax cuts after 2025. Also, some inflation adjustments imposed by the law are less generous than previous ones.", "Separately, the center\u2019s analysis indicates that from the get-go, some taxpayers within each income bracket will likely pay more in taxes--though 95 percent will see reductions or not lose ground.", "By phone to our inquiry, the center\u2019s Mark Mazur pointed out that the analysis shows a subset of taxpayers in each quintile stand to pay more in taxes in the plan\u2019s first year, 2018. At the low end, Table 4 states, 1.2 percent of taxpayers in the lowest income quintile will pay more; at the high end, the table indicates, 6.2 percent of taxpayers in the highest income quintile stand to pay more in taxes than if the law hadn\u2019t changed.", "Also, the center\u2019s breakdown suggests, nearly one in five of the nation\u2019s tip-top wealthiest will see higher taxes.

McMahon otherwise speculated that Cruz with his locale-specific claim \"was playing to the stereotypes people have\" about where the very wealthiest Americans abide.", "Annette Nellen, a San Jose State University expert on tax law, provided us with a document she drafted spelling out the likely tax effects on different taxpayers. Generally, Nellen\u2019s presentation states, most individuals will see tax reductions though individual results will depend, in part, on types of income and amounts; the ages of dependent children; and whether lost deductions drive up taxes more than savings attributable to reduced rates.", "Our ruling", "Cruz said that under the tax changes, every \"taxpayer, their taxes are going down, except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco.

Also, those most likely to see their taxes go up include wealthy wage earners in high-tax states and cities.", "Still, projections show that across income groups, not every taxpayer will see lower taxes, contrary to what Cruz said, and many of those who do see tax savings are likely to lose them after 2025.
