["President Joe Biden ran his presidential campaign on\u00a0the underlying promise that he would be an entirely different leader\u00a0than Donald Trump. In keeping with that, following his Jan. 20\u00a0inauguration, Biden's administration has been unravelling Trump's policies.", "Since he took office, Biden has signed more than\u00a040\u00a0executive orders and actions\u00a0with focuses ranging from health care\u00a0to the economy.", "Some orders, like the reversal of Trump's\u00a0ban on\u00a0transgender people\u00a0joining the military, undid work from the previous administration. Many others relating to the coronavirus\u00a0are exclusive to advancing the goals of the\u00a0new administration.", "Biden's slew of executive orders has\u00a0been met with pushback from conservatives, against\u00a0both the number of orders issued and the president's past quotes about them.", "For instance, both\u00a0Senate Minority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell and\u00a0Fox News personality Sean Hannity\u00a0have misquoted Biden in trying to use his own words against him.\u00a0The incorrect quotation has been picked up in viral social media posts that also compare\u00a0executive orders among Biden and his predecessors.", "One Facebook post\u00a0shows a graphic of the last five presidents and how many executive orders they signed during their first week in office, which for each\u00a0would be Jan. 20-27. At the bottom\u00a0is a quote attributed to\u00a0Biden: \"You can't (legislate) by executive order unless you're a dictator.\"", "A similar post\u00a0says Biden signed 37 executive orders in his first week, Barack Obama signed nine and Trump signed five. There is also a quote attributed to Biden that reads, \"Only a Dictator legislates through executive orders!\"", "USA TODAY has reached out to both users for comment.", "Let's look into both the numbers and the quote in question.", "More:Fact check: Biden executive order halts border wall construction, redirects funding", "Biden has now signed more than 40\u00a0executive orders, actions and memorandums \u2014 each of which has\u00a0a different power and purpose \u2014 during his first few weeks\u00a0in office. Of those,\u00a029\u00a0are executive orders, according to the Federal Register.", "Social media posts about the number of executive orders signed by Biden in his first week vary. For example, this post says he signed 32, while\u00a0this one says he signed 37.", "The first post, which cites NBC News as its source, compares Biden's orders to four past presidents;\u00a0the second post only includes totals for\u00a0Obama\u00a0and Trump.", "In\u00a0their first week in office,\u00a0Trump signed five\u00a0orders, Obama signed five, George W. Bush signed zero\u00a0and Bill Clinton signed zero. In Biden's first week, he signed 24 executive orders, all according to the Federal Register.", "The Federal Register publishes\u00a0regulations, proposed rules and notices of interest to the public every weekday.", "On top of Biden's 29 orders, he has signed 14\u00a0proclamations and memorandums, bringing the grand total of executive actions to 43\u00a0as of Feb. 8.", "Both posts were slightly off in their final tallies of executive orders signed by Biden and other\u00a0former presidents in their first week in office.", "It's worth noting that Biden explicitly campaigned on a\u00a0promise to sign executive orders \u2014 both targeted at reversing Trump policies and addressing the coronavirus \u2014\u00a0if he was elected.", "For example, the orders Biden signed on climate action fulfill\u00a0the\u00a0campaign promise that is still on his website, \"On day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track.\"", "Of the signed actions, 18\u00a0have been reversals of Trump administration policy.", "Prominent conservatives have expressed their disapproval of Biden's\u00a0use of executive orders and actions, and have attempted to use his own words against him.", "On his Jan. 26 show, Hannity said, \"Biden signed off on a record number of executive orders during his first week but just three months ago, according to Biden himself, that's something only a dictator would do.\"", "And in the Senate, McConnell said, \"As recently as October, now-President Biden said you can't legislate by executive action unless you are a dictator. Well, in one week, he signed more than 30 unilateral actions.\"", "Biden's comment about executive orders and dictators is from an\u00a0October town hall hosted by ABC News.", "The full quote was in defense of his tax plan, following\u00a0a comment from host George Stephanopoulos. \"So, there's not going to be any delay on the tax increases?\" he asked, referencing Biden's plans to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy and Biden's answer to previous questions.", "Biden replied:\u00a0\"No, well, I've gotta get the votes. I gotta get the votes. That's why \u2014 you know, the one thing that I \u2014 I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends even occasionally say, 'Well, if you can't get the votes, by executive order you're going to do something.' Things you can't do by executive order unless you're a dictator. We're a democracy. We need consensus.\"", "Biden's comment was not about the use of executive orders in general, but was instead related to the use of\u00a0executive orders to legislate what\u00a0he said he believes should require approval from Congress.", "The quote\u00a0has been twisted to imply that he\u00a0believes the use of executive orders in general is bad.", "The claims in the post have been rated as MISSING CONTEXT. Biden has signed more executive orders \u2014 29 orders and 14 proclamations and memorandums \u2014 \u00a0in the first weeks of his presidency than previous presidents, but the\u00a0quote in question has been taken out of context. Biden's comment about executive orders and dictators\u00a0was made in response to a question about his tax plan and how he believes that some legislation requires the support of Congress, meaning that presidents should avoid\u00a0using\u00a0executive orders in those instances.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
