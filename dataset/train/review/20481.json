No More Deaths is an Arizona humanitarian group that leaves water, food, and other supplies for migrants traveling through the desert to get to the United States. In January, the group released a report on the \"intentional destruction\" of thousands of gallons of water left for migrants. \"Although it is likely that multiple actors are responsible for the destruction of humanitarian aid at our water-drop sites, the results of our (Geographic Information Systems) data analysis indicate that U.S. Border Patrol agents likely are the most consistent actors,\" the report said.", "Part of the Border Patrol\u2019s January response to the footage said:", "\"All agents in the Tucson Sector have been instructed not to remove or destroy water stations, food or other resources left along trails in the desert.
