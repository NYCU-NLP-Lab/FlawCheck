["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on February 11, 2020", "President Donald Trump posted a five-minute-plus video on social media that falsely implied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disrespected a Tuskegee airman and other Americans during the State of the Union.", "The social media posts claim to show \u201cpowerful American stories ripped to shreds by Nancy Pelosi.\u201d But the Trump video \u2014 which has more than 11 million views \u2014 was misleadingly edited to make it appear that Pelosi ripped up the president\u2019s speech immediately after he honored the Tuskegee airman, retired Brig. Gen. Charles E. McGee, and other White House guests.", "In fact, the House speaker did not tear up a copy of the president\u2019s Feb. 4 address until the speech was over.", "It\u2019s fair game for Trump to claim Pelosi disrespected him by tearing up the speech.", "But, as we show in our video, Pelosi stood and clapped for McGee. She clapped at some point for all the White House guests featured in Trump\u2019s video \u2013 with the exception of conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
