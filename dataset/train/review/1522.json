["About this rating", "Oprah Winfrey delivered a rousing speech on racial and gender equality while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes ceremony on 7 January 2018, prompting media speculation about a future political career, including a possible 2020 presidential bid.", "It also prompted the spread of derogatory rumors by her detractors.", "One such rumor centered on comments Winfrey made during a 2013 BBC interview in which she was asked whether or not she believes the problem of racism has been solved. Her alleged response? In order for the problem of racism to be solved, \"old white people have to die.\"", "Here's an example of a tweet asserting that Winfrey said it:", "Oprah's solution to racism; Old white people \"just have to die\".", "What a horribly divisive message. pic.twitter.com/NOtaft2xxf", "\u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 8, 2018", "This way of framing Winfrey's 2013 remarks isn't new.

Because what could be more racist than planning a post-racial utopia that depends on people of a certain race dying.", "Despite what's stated above, however, Winfrey's remarks weren't specifically targeted at white people. She did not say \"All old white people have to die,\" or \"White older people have to die,\" or any other fabricated, race-based version of her actual remarks. In fact, she never uttered the phrase \"white people\" at all.", "Here is the full BBC interview:", "WINFREY: It would be foolish to not recognize that we have evolved, and that we're not still facing the same kind of terrorism against black people en masse as was displayed with the Scottsboro boys. It's gotten better.", "Are there still places where people are terrorized because of the color of their skin, because of the color of their black skin? Yes.

In other words, those accusing Winfrey of racism draw a false equivalence between \"generations marinated in racism\" and \"all older white people.\"", "However contentious and impolitic it may have been for Winfrey to claim that older generations steeped in prejudice will have to die before the problem of racism can be solved, the objection that it was racist of her to say so is absurd.", "Selk, Avi. \u00a0\"Oprah Might Run for President.
