["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on August 4, 2016", "A common Republican falsehood \u2014 a claim that Syrian refugees being admitted to the U.S. are \u201cunvetted\u201d \u2014 is beginning to infect campaign TV ads.", "In fact, all refugees seeking to enter the U.S. must pass a more rigorous screening than anyone else allowed into the country, and those from Syria are subjected to special measures including iris scans and an \u201cenhanced review\u201d by the Department of Homeland Security.", "We have already seen the misleading term \u201cunvetted\u201d applied to Syrian refugees by some Republican House members, conservative websites and conservative newspapers.", "And now it\u2019s being used in scary-looking GOP TV ads, too.", "In Ft. Myers, Florida, a Republican primary candidate for the House, Francis Rooney, started running an ad July 30 showing hooded Islamic State fighters, as the narrator says, \u201c[President] Obama still wants to let unvetted Syrians in.\u201d Later, Rooney himself appears and says, \u201cAllowing unvetted Syrians into our country is a risk we simply can\u2019t take.\u201d", "And in Minnesota, GOP House hopeful Stewart Mills started airing an ad Aug. 1 accusing incumbent Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan of supporting \u201cbringing 100,000 unvetted Syrians to America before the end of the year.\u201d", "These candidates have a right to argue that the vetting for Syrian refugees isn\u2019t adequate; that\u2019s a matter of opinion. And indeed, FBI Director James Comey testified last year that screening Syrians is particularly challenging, and that he can\u2019t guarantee there is no risk involved.", "But that\u2019s a far cry from saying that Syrians aren\u2019t screened at all, which is what the term \u201cunvetted\u201d means in plain English.", "To \u201cvet\u201d something or someone, according to standard dictionary definitions, means in this context \u201cto evaluate for possible approval or acceptance\u201d or \u201cto examine a person\u2019s record to see that it is acceptable.\u201d And nobody can honestly deny that all refugees \u2014 Syrians in particular \u2014 are examined and evaluated, and rather extensively.", "The U.S. State Department says\u00a0that all refugees \u201care subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to our country.\u201d The process includes reviews by the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Department of Homeland Security.", "In the case of refugees from Syria, an \u201cenhanced\u201d review is made, which can include referral to the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate of the U.S. Citizenship\u00a0and Immigration Services.", "All refugees are fingerprinted and their prints compared to those on file in the biometric databases of the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense, which includes fingerprint records captured in Iraq and elsewhere. In the case of refugees from Syria, iris scans are also used.", "The Mills ad attacking Nolan is particularly dishonest in accusing Nolan of favoring entry of \u201cunvetted\u201d refugees. Nolan favors continued acceptance of Syrians, but also is on record emphasizing that anyone coming into the country must be vetted.", "The Brainerd Dispatch in Minnesota reported months ago:", "Brainerd Dispatch, Nov. 18, 2015: Nolan [said] the U.S. must \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d to protect itself from ISIS. The nation\u2019s intelligence gathering must be examined, and anyone entering the country from abroad must be screened, he said, \u201cregardless of the time or the inconvenience involved.\u201d", "Worldwide there are\u00a0nearly 5 million Syrian refugees who have been displaced by the country\u2019s civil war, which began in 2011, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Obama administration plans to accept up to\u00a010,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. As of Aug. 4, the U.S. had accepted 9,835 Syrian refugees since Obama took office, with the vast majority being accepted in the past two years.", "As for the claim that Nolan supported bringing 100,000 Syrians to the U.S. by the end of 2016, that\u2019s true. Last September, Nolan was one of 72 House Democrats who signed a letter urging Obama to accept a Refugee Council USA recommendation to \u201csettle a minimum of 200,000 refugees by the end of 2016, including 100,000 Syrian refugees.\u201d", "However, after the Nov. 13, 2015, Paris attacks, Nolan\u00a0voted for the Republican-sponsored SAFE Act legislation that would have barred admission of any refugee from Syria or Iraq unless the homeland security secretary, with the concurrence of the director of national intelligence and the FBI, \u201ccertifies \u2026 that the [refugee] is not a threat to the security of the United States.\u201d", "The bill passed the House 289-137, but later died in the Senate when supporters could not muster the 60 votes required to bring it to the floor.", "To be sure, there are valid concerns about the Syrian refugee vetting process. FBI Director Comey testified Oct. 22, 2015, before the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0that \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there\u2019s no risk associated with this.\u201d", "Comey went into more detail in his\u00a0Oct. 21 testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee. He said screening procedures had improved from earlier years, but that U.S. databases have less information on Syrian terrorists than on those from Iraq, where the U.S. military operated for years.", "FBI Director Comey, Oct. 21, 2015: We can only query against that which we have collected. And so if someone has never\u00a0made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interests reflected in our database, we can query our databases until the cows come home but \u2026 nothing [will] show up because we have no record on\u00a0that person.", "Video of Comey\u2019s response begins at 54 minutes into the hearing.", "However, as mentioned earlier, others besides the FBI are involved in the vetting \u2014 including intelligence agencies. Furthermore, techniques other than a simple database check are used. For example, Syrian applicants for refugee status are interviewed by specially trained officials of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.", "So Syrian refugees are all vetted in multiple ways.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/766fb2b9-480f-4ca4-bc61-57cf8addf18f", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
