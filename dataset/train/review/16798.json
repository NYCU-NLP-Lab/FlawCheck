O\u2019Rourke said he\u2019d invest in infrastructure, because aging systems and climate change impact the quality of water Americans drink.", "\"Sixty million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe,\" O\u2019Rourke said April 29.", "Flint, Mich., became a campaign stop and political talking point in the 2016 presidential election as the city grappled with lead-contaminated water.

We found that his framing is more conclusive than the investigation and needs context.", "News21 is a national student investigative initiative at the Walter Cronkite School School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. Its reporters analyzed 680,000 violations logged over a 10-year period (starting Jan. 1, 2007) in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System.", "News21 examined violations by active community water systems, a type of public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round.

The review homed in on violations for health, monitoring and reporting.", "The team documented EPA violations around the country, from rural communities in California to New York City boroughs. They found that many local water treatment plants \u2014 especially in poor, minority and small communities \u2014 didn\u2019t have the money to buy the equipment needed to filter out contaminants. Those include arsenic found naturally in rock, factory chemicals and fecal matter from farming.", "The finding most relevant to this fact-check: As many as 63 million people were exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once during the 10-year period analyzed.", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement reflects the News21 estimate, but leaves out the nuance \u2014 the story didn\u2019t outright say 63 million are actively affected, and it noted that some places had resolved their water issues. (Further, the EPA acknowledged that the database might not include all violations and that some information may be incorrect.)", "The majority of people in affected areas \u200bmight have been exposed to unsafe drinking water only for a very short period of time, said Newsha Ajami, director of Urban Water Policy for the Water in the West initiative at Stanford University.", "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s number is \"broadly reasonable,\" said Manny Teodoro, an associate professor in the department of political science at Texas A&M University.

While drinking water contaminants over a long period of time can be harmful, many contaminants don\u2019t pose immediate health risks and many only last for several weeks or less, she said.", "Allaire\u2019s study did not include monitoring and reporting violations, unlike News21, because she said it\u2019s unclear how to interpret those violations \u00a0\u2014 some of them stem from administrative errors or delays that don\u2019t directly impact water quality.", "Data from the EPA for fiscal year 2017 provides a similar estimate for community water systems with health-based violations.

And short-term violations are different from failing systems that cannot provide safe drinking water over long periods of time. Those failing systems are often found in rural and low-income communities.", "Better data tracking is needed. Currently, the system for monitoring water quality depends on self-reporting. For smaller systems, that\u2019s an issue, due to lack of employees, technology and finances, said Ajami, the water policy expert.
