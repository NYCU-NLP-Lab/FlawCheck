["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on December 14, 2020", "Facebook posts have repeated a false claim about a \u201cone in a quadrillion\u201d chance that President-elect Joe Biden received more votes than President Donald Trump in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Experts told us the claim misuses a questionable statistical analysis that made implausible assumptions about the 2020 election.", "A failed lawsuit seeking to have the U.S. Supreme Court invalidate election results in four battleground states that Biden won makes false claims about the improbability of Biden\u2019s victory. At least one of those claims is now being repeated on Facebook.", "\u201cFor President Trump To Be Ahead As Far As He Was At 3am In Mich,Penn,Wisconsin,And Georgia, And For The Vote To Swing As Much As It Did In Biden\u2019s Favor, The Mathmatical Probability Of That Happening In Just \u2018One\u2019 State Alone Is, 1 And 1 Quadrillion!!,\u201d one of those posts reads. \u201cAnd The Probability Of That Happening In 4 States Simultaneously is: 1,000,000,000,000,000 To The 4Th Power. So,The \u2018False\u2019 And \u2018Baseless\u2019 Election Fraud You Blindly Scream About Is 100% True!!\u201d", "Minus the typos, that\u2019s nearly identical to a claim made in a lawsuit Ken Paxton, the Republican attorney general of Texas, filed in the U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 7.", "The court filing says: \u201cThe probability of former Vice President Biden winning the popular vote in the four Defendant States \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 independently given President Trump\u2019s early lead in those States as of 3 a.m. on November 4, 2020, is less than one in a quadrillion, or 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000. For former Vice President Biden to win these four States collectively, the odds of that event happening decrease to less than one in a quadrillion to the fourth power.\u201d", "White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany promoted the claim on social media and\u00a0repeated it on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show.", "The court filing says the claim is based on an expert declaration written by economist Charles J. Cicchetti. But that\u2019s not exactly what Cicchetti wrote in his analysis of election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.", "Instead, Cicchetti said he tested whether the ballots counted in those states until 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 were from a similarly random pool of voters as the ballots counted in the hours and days after. He also tested whether Biden\u2019s performance in those states was statistically similar to Hillary Clinton\u2019s in 2016.", "In both cases, his analysis, not surprisingly, showed they were not. We know that Biden outperformed Clinton. And we know ballots states counted on and after Election Day weren\u2019t from a random pool of voters: Some states counted mail-in ballots before Nov. 3, while others were still counting them days later. Democrats were more likely to vote by mail.", "\u201cI reject the hypothesis that the Biden and Clinton votes are similar with great confidence many times greater than one in a quadrillion in all four states,\u201d Cicchetti wrote. \u201cThe degree of confidence is even greater for rejecting the hypothesis that the early morning after election tabulations and the subsequent tabulations were drawn from the same population of all voters.\u201d", "His declaration does argue that had Biden\u2019s support been similar to Clinton\u2019s, and had ballots counted before and after 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 come from similar populations of Biden and Trump voters, then Biden\u2019s win would be highly improbable. But that doesn\u2019t actually show Biden had a \u201cone in a quadrillion\u201d chance of victory in those states.", "\u201cI think the Texas [attorney general] intentionally misrepresented what Cicchetti said,\u201d Justin Ryan Grimmer, a Stanford University professor of political science, told us in a phone interview. \u201cThe Texas AG took the Cicchetti analysis to a conclusion that I don\u2019t think Cicchetti says at all in his analysis.\u201d", "We contacted Cicchetti to ask if that was the case, but did not get a response.", "In a Twitter thread about Cicchetti\u2019s analysis, Grimmer wrote: \u201cCicchetti never tries to compute the probability of Biden winning. Instead, he implausibly assumes Biden and Clinton have identical support or that early- and late-tabulated votes are randomly sampled. His probabilities teach us very little about the true chance of Biden winning.\u201d", "Cicchetti wrote that Biden\u2019s win required further scrutiny because Trump\u2019s apparent election night lead in those swing states vanished as more ballots were counted after 3 a.m. the following morning. For example, he said, \u201cThe Georgia reversal in the outcome raises questions because the votes tabulated in the two time periods could not be random samples from the same population of all votes cast.\u201d", "But we know they weren\u2019t, and Cicchetti mentioned the reason why in his declaration.", "\u201cI am aware of anecdotal statements from election night that some Democrat strongholds were yet to be tabulated. There was also some speculation that the yet-to-be counted ballots were likely absentee mail-in ballots. Either could cause the latter ballots to be non-randomly different than the nearly 95% of ballots counted by 3AM EST,\u201d he said.", "That\u2019s exactly what was reported to have happened.", "As of around 8 a.m on Nov. 4, Trump still had a lead in Georgia of roughly 117,000 votes. But about 200,000 absentee and mail-in ballots had yet to be counted, according to the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. The majority of those outstanding ballots were from Fulton, DeKalb and Cobb counties, and Biden ended up winning all three counties with nearly 73%, 83% and 56% of the vote, respectively.", "The fact that Trump lost his lead as more ballots were counted was not unexpected.", "\u201cWe knew there would be a \u2018blue shift\u2019 when [vote-by-mail] ballots were tabulated because Trump discouraged his supporters from voting by mail, resulting in a larger fraction of the VBM ballots having votes for Biden,\u201d Philip B. Stark, professor and associate dean of mathematical and physical sciences at the University of California Berkeley, said in an email. \u201cWe knew that would happen. Cicchetti tests whether the in-person votes are like the VBM votes. They are not, but that\u2019s not surprising and not a sign of fraud. People who voted in person are not a random sample of voters. They are disproportionately Trump supporters. People who voted by mail are not a random sample of voters. They are disproportionately Biden voters. All this is what was expected.\u201d", "That\u2019s supported by a post-election survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, which found that 67% of Trump supporters said they voted in person compared with 58% of Biden supporters who said they voted by absentee or mail-in ballot.", "In Pennsylvania, for example, registered Democrats returned mail ballots at nearly three times the rate of Republicans.", "We also know that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions more Americans voted by mail in 2020 than in 2016. And state laws in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin prevented election officials in those states from counting mail-in ballots before Election Day. That contributed to those votes being counted and reported later than votes that were cast in person on or before Nov. 3.", "\u201cAs many have pointed out, this analysis exploits the fact that Democratic counties reported their results later, primarily due to their larger size and large number of mail ballots, which Republican state legislatures prevented election officials from preparing for counting in advance of Election Day,\u201d said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who runs the United States Elections Project.", "We previously wrote that Biden overtook Trump in Wisconsin early in the morning on Nov. 4 \u201cwhen Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic,\u201d according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. And Biden, on the strength of absentee ballots from large counties, including Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and Kent, took the lead from Trump in Michigan at about 9 a.m. that same day, local news outlets reported.", "It wasn\u2019t until Nov. 6 that Biden went ahead of Trump in the vote count in Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2014 again as more mail-in ballots from heavily Democratic areas were counted.", "As for the Clinton and Biden comparison, Cicchetti\u2019s declaration says that he finds \u201cthe increase of Biden over Clinton is statistically incredible if the outcomes were based on similar populations of voters supporting the two Democratic candidates.\u201d", "But his analysis showed that Biden and Clinton didn\u2019t have similar levels of support. As we\u2019ve written before, Biden outperformed Clinton in every state \u2014 not just swing states \u2013 both by the number and the percentage of votes.", "\u201cThe populations of voters are not the same in the two elections, so the test based on a binomial distribution argument is not well-defined or properly applicable,\u201d Walter Mebane, a professor of political science and statistics at the University of Michigan, explained in an email. \u201cAs a simple descriptive matter it doesn\u2019t tell anything we didn\u2019t know upon observing that Biden received a higher percentage of the votes cast in 2020 than Clinton did of the votes cast in 2016,\u201d Mebane said of Cicchetti\u2019s analysis.", "In another email, Paul Gronke, a professor and director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College, told us: \u201cDr. Cicchetti\u2019s analysis is naive and is being misused.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
