Brazziell).", "A major business group predicts billions of dollars in economic losses should Texas lawmakers advance \"discriminatory\" legislation including so-called bathroom bills or measures limiting local control of non-discrimination ordinances.", "We checked on whether the widely cited projections, linked to actions in other states, hold up.", "Portions of the study commissioned by the Texas Association of Business proved solid. But other elements were shaky. One projection, for instance, rests in the Super Bowl set for Houston on Feb. 5, 2017 being moved to another state. Another extrapolates Texas losses from research rooted in Arizona\u2019s immigration law--not that state\u2019s failed proposal targeting LGBT residents. And the report\u2019s biggest projected loss to Texas starts from an Indiana legislator\u2019s comment that might lack documentary backup.", "There could be heft to claims that a Texas Senate proposal poses economic risks. Opponents of Senate Bill 6, requiring Texas residents to use bathrooms matching their assigned sex at birth, underscore North Carolina\u2019s experience, which gets TAB attention elsewhere in its report presenting the possible economic losses. In 2016, Republicans in the Tarheel State curbed protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, touching off economic losses mostly tied to boycotts adding up to as much as $201 million, PolitiFact North Carolina confirmed.", "The TAB, which calls itself the state\u2019s leading advocate for employers, initially highlighted the study that caught our attention in a Dec. 6, 2016, press release urging the 2017 Legislature to spurn \"discriminatory legislation.\" That release said the study, undertaken at St. Edward\u2019s University in Austin, found that a \u00a0discriminatory law could result in $964 million to $8.5 billion in reduced state gross domestic product and up to 185,000 lost jobs, partly due to fallout in the tourism sector. State GDP refers to the market value of all final goods and services produced within a state in a particular period of time.", "We broke down the figures in the study, exploring research assumptions and identifying instances of unstated or questionable sourcing. Separately, outside experts sounded a few cautionary notes.", "University researchers unavailable for interview", "We were barred from talking to the people who made the projections. But at the association\u2019s request, Brad Zehner, a St. Edward\u2019s associate professor of management, addressed a set of questions in writing. We fielded Zehner\u2019s responses by email from the association\u2019s Belinda Matingou after a university spokeswoman, Mischelle Diaz, advised by email that faculty and students who did the study had signed non-disclosure agreements prohibiting additional commentary. She further said the \"research provided should not be interpreted as the official position of the university, but rather that it contains views and opinions of the student teams based on discussions, observations and analysis.\"", "Study\u2019s timeframe, scope", "Zehner wrote that four St. Edward\u2019s business graduate students under faculty supervision reached the projections in December 2015--or more than a year before the 2017 legislative session.

Arizona\u2019s proposal was vetoed, a Louisiana gubernatorial order was rescinded and Indiana\u2019s law was amended not to apply to LGBT residents.", "Also, the study presents the potential Texas costs as a three-year forecast. Zehner, asked to explain that length of time, said: \"A singular event such as the loss of the Super Bowl or the March Madness tournament does not have a one-time impact on an economy but rather ripples through multiple years as ancillary businesses are impacted. Think about tourism. If out-of-state tourists have a great experience in Austin, Dallas, Houston, or San Antonio, they will tell friends who might decide to vacation in Texas the following year. A multi-year projection is more meaningful than a single-year projection.\"", "State by state", "Let\u2019s look at the numbers behind the projections, state by state.", "Arizona", "In 2014, Arizona\u2019s legislature advanced a proposal, vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer, allowing businesses to deny services on religious grounds--a change in law widely taken as permitting discrimination against gays.

Pollack and Company, the Scottsdale-based firm that reached the figure, to review the Texas citation. By email, Court commented: \"Our report had nothing to do with issues pertaining to religious freedom policies.\" Court further said it\u2019s \"unclear, but likely, that the $140 million figure was not the correct figure to base an extrapolation from.\" Then again, he said by phone, he hasn\u2019t probed if a Texas law would result in greater or lesser losses.", "In the Arizona analysis, the Texas study says the estimated three-year impact of similar Texas legislation could be $464 million to $964 million, that high-end figure, we confirmed, rests in Texas losing the equivalent of the 2017 Super Bowl.

But a web search yielded a May 2015 Travel Weekly news story quoting Stephen Perry, ceo of the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau, talking about the failed legislation. According to the story, Perry said 80 percent to 85 percent of the city's \"most important corporate customers\" called to say that if it were to pass, \"it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019re going to be able to come back here.\" The story also quoted Perry saying Jindal\u2019s order \"caused a lot of consternation and confusion.\"", "We asked a bureau spokesman, Kristian Sonnier, about Perry\u2019s conventions statement.

After negative reactions, the study notes, legislators amended the law to blunt its effect on LGBT residents. Still, the study says, the economic impact was calculated as $1.5 billion in short-term losses alone.", "The study footnotes that figure to a web link that didn\u2019t work when we tried. But we found an April 2015 WNDU news story attributing the $1.5 billion figure to an Indiana legislator, Terri Austin, quoted saying that she\u2019d talked to industry professionals and concluded the original Indiana act had caused the state to lose $1.5 billion in meetings and conventions. \"I talked to some of the industry professionals just to get the facts and figures so I didn't just pull them out of thin air,\" Austin said.", "We tried to reach Austin about what went into her figure, which she brought up in April 2015 legislative debate. At our inquiry, John Schorg, a staff spokesman for Indiana\u2019s Democratic House caucus, said Austin told him that she drew on discussions she had with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the Indiana Restaurant and Hotel Lodging Association and the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce. Schorg said documentation of the figure, if any, is long gone.", "Indiana\u2019s losses might not have been that huge.

The story said Chris Gahl, vice president of marketing for Visit Indy, reported that in 2015, 12 conventions cited RFRA as at least one reason they chose not to book Indianapolis. But that loss of $60 million amounted to a small piece of Indianapolis's $4.5 billion tourism industry, the story said.", "Matingou put us in touch with Gahl, who affirmed the $60 million loss, adding by email: \"This economic impact number would have significantly escalated had the amendment\" protecting LGBT residents \"not been put in place so swiftly.\" Neither he nor other Indiana\u00a0officials we reached offered a basis or backup data for the $1.5 billion figure.", "The Texas study accurately recapped fall-out in Indiana before its law was amended including an NCAA chief expressing serious concerns over hosting events in the state, Apple CEO Tim Cook penning a critical\u00a0commentary\u00a0and Indianapolis-based Angie\u2019s List saying it was cancelling a $40 million headquarters expansion due to Indiana\u2019s law.", "The Texas study says that if a similar law passed in Texas, the estimated impact could reach $8.5 billion.", "How so? \"Given that the Texas travel industry has a $31 billion annual impact, a 15 percent reduction would result in an overall loss of $8.5 billion,\" the study says, \"or 0.5% of the State GDP, the same percentage GDP loss experienced by Indiana,\" which equates to more than 150,000 \u00a0jobs, the study says.", "This needed unpacking.", "We didn\u2019t see a study source for the stated $31 billion annual impact of the Texas travel industry though Matingou pointed out that Oregon-based Dean Runyan Associates, which employs its model to calculate travel and tourism spending for states, pegged the 2015 GDP of the Texas travel industry at $33.5 billion.", "Also, Matingou told us, the \"15 percent\" reduction was a typo that should have said \"0.5 percent,\" as the study states otherwise. She further said the researchers projected Texas potentially losing $8.5 billion in GDP starting from the realization that the $1.5 billion in declared losses to Indiana was equal to 0.5 percent of that state\u2019s GDP. Applying the same percentage to Texas\u2019s GDP of $1.7 trillion, she noted, breaks out to $8.5 billion.", "We didn\u2019t spot sources for state GDPs in the study. When we asked, Matingou said the study relied on a July 2015 report from the Texas state comptroller stating Texas had a 2015 Gross State Product of $1.657 trillion; researchers rounded that up to $1.7 billion, she said, with 0.5 percent of that being $8.5 billion.", "Outside experts", "Experts including economist John Gnuschke of the University of Memphis mostly saw no major problems with the research approach. Gnuschke wrote: \"State-to-state impact comparisons are widely used for studies of this kind but are difficult given the wide range of policy variations and economic conditions in each state,\" Gnuschke wrote. \"Individual states find it difficult to assess the impact of any policy.\"", "But economist Craig Depken of the University of North Carolina-Charlotte and Timothy Werner, a University of Texas professor, each urged caution in converting data from other states into specific Texas forecasts. Werner said: \"One of the biggest challenges faced by this sort of study is that we don\u2019t have a lot of data on the actual effects of these bills, as only one (in North Carolina) has gone into effect.\"", "A Wharton professor, Maurice Schweitzer, and Don Hoyte of Austin, a former 20-year analyst for the Texas state comptroller\u2019s office, each said he\u2019d expect an anti-LGBT law to be detrimental to the Texas economy.

Though I cannot forecast the exact amount, I am positive that a measure limiting transgender bathroom choices will harm the Texas economy.\"", "Hoyte said a weakness is the study\u2019s focus on the overall state economy when it makes better sense to expect distinct effects among local economies--tourism-dependent San Antonio, for instance, or other big cities in terms of the likelihood of big sporting events not coming to town.", "Matingou later reminded us the study presented ranges of possible impact, also saying: \"The researchers you consulted echo TAB\u2019s concern that discriminatory legislation will have a significant, negative impact on the Texas economy.\"", "Our ruling", "The TAB said a study projects up to $8.5 billion in lost GDP and up to 185,000 lost jobs in Texas if\u00a0lawmakers approve a discriminatory measure like proposals\u00a0in other states.", "Such a law might cause economic shivers.
