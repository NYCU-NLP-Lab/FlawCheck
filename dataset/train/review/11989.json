I can't find anything about it and I'm sure I'm not the only one looking.", "The Freddy Kruger character was based on a real serial killer who lived in Cincinnati,OH in the 1800s. According to police files of the time, Mr. Kruger had killed at least twenty children within a three mile radius of where he lived. He reportedly murdered the children using only a gardening claw, and he lived inside an abandoned factory; having set up a small living area (and torture area) within the \"mechanical room\" of the facility. Oh...back then, a \"mechanical room\" was also known as a \"boiler room\".", "Mr. Kruger was eventually caught, tried, and found to be criminally insane. He spent the rest of his life in Kings Park Psychiatric Hospital before dying unexpectedly in his sleep at the age of 72.", "To this day (and LONG before the Elm St. films) Kings Park Psych Hospital was said to be haunted by the ghost of Freddy Kruger!", "Iterations of the rumor placed the \"real-life\" Freddy Krueger murders (often misspelled \"Kruger\") as local to Cincinnati, Brooklyn, and other areas.

He told his parents he was afraid that if he slept, the thing chasing him would get him, so he tried to stay awake for days at a time. When he finally fell asleep, his parents thought this crisis was over. Then they heard screams in the middle of the night. By the time they got to him, he was dead.
