["\u201cNow he wants to tax our 401k's and IRA's (page 78, Dems' platform),\u201d James Woods said in a September 13, 2020 tweet shared more than 45,000 times.", "The actor is one of the few Hollywood celebrities to openly support President Donald Trump.", "His tweet was shared on Facebook, including here and here. A similar claim was also shared on Facebook here.", "\u201cIt's very exaggerated and misleading,\u201d Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told AFP by phone.", "Garrett Watson, of the non-profit Tax Foundation, agreed that the claim is misleading. \u201cThat's the best way to frame it,\u201d he said.", "Contrary to Woods\u2019 assertion, Page 78 of the Democratic Platform deals with veterans, military and transnational issues -- not retirement savings.", "A reference on Page 23 to reforming the tax code promises \u201ceasier and more equitable access to tax provisions that help working families build wealth, including by equalizing tax benefits for retirement contributions,\u201d but makes no specific mention of 401(k) plans or IRAs.", "A similar pledge appears on the Biden campaign website.", "Contributions to traditional 401(k) and Individual Retirement Arrangement plans are deductible from taxable income. Investment income earned by the accounts is also tax-free -- but these deferred taxes on contributions and earnings are paid when money is withdrawn.", "\u201cThis benefit of having a tax-free accumulation of income is not affected by the Biden proposal. So that major benefit of having a 401(k) will remain intact,\u201d said Toder, a former Treasury Department appointee.", "However, the Biden plan would end the tax deductions, replacing them with a tax credit that analysts calculate would be 26 percent of an individual\u2019s contribution.", "Whether or not that amounts to a benefit would depend on a person\u2019s income, Toder explained, using a $1 contribution as an example.", "\u201cIf you're in the 15 percent tax bracket it's a benefit because now you only get basically 15 cents back from deducting it. If you're in the 37 percent bracket -- which he's going to raise to 39.6 percent --\u00a0 then you're better off getting the deduction which is worth 39.6 cents than the credit which is worth 26 cents,\u201d Toder\u00a0said.", "For higher income earners, \u201cit can be looked at as a tax increase,\u201d he added.", "\u201cSome high income people are going to lose a little bit of their tax benefit from a 401(k),\u201d but most of those earners will still benefit from 401(k) contributions because tax-free accumulation of earnings will continue, Toder said.", "Watson agreed that a reduction in the benefit for those with higher incomes \u201cwould increase the tax burden\u201d that they may face.", "\u201cThis credit is expected to be roughly revenue neutral, with the elimination of deductibility offsetting the revenue lost from the new tax credit,\u201d Watson wrote in an analysis of the Biden plan.", "Wealthier taxpayers would still have the option to use Roth accounts, contributions to which are taxed but can be withdrawn tax-free along with the earnings. This won\u2019t change, the analysts said.", "The social media posts are correct in saying that then-senator Biden voted in 1983 for the Social Security Amendments, under which a portion of Social Security benefits became taxable. But he was one of 26 Democrats and 32 Republicans in the Senate supporting the measure.", "In 1993, he also supported the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. It included raising to 85 percent the maximum taxable amount for some social security beneficiaries, based on a formula.", "Biden was one of 50 Democratic Senators supporting that bill in the Conference Report vote. Fifty other Republicans and Democrats were against, leading to a tie-breaker vote by Vice President Al Gore. He, not Biden, was the \u201cdeciding\u201d vote.", "Republicans have falsely claimed that Biden wants widespread tax hikes, but the presidential contender has repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year.", "According to Watson, Biden\u2019s team has said the changes to retirement benefits would also not affect those earning less than $400,000, \u201cbut they haven\u2019t specified how they would do that.\u201d", "The Verify Team, as reported by WUSA-9, first examined\u00a0Biden's Social Security benefits voting record and the claim about his proposal for retirement funds.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
