When he headed back to the White House from the hospital, he advised people on Twitter, \"Don\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life.\"", "He followed that up with another tweet the next morning.", "\"Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,\" he wrote Oct. 6. \"Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!\"", "Twitter has now flagged that tweet for \"sharing misleading and potentially harmful information\" about COVID-19.

The CDC said that \"the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19.\"", "Broadly, for people of all ages who show flu symptoms, the CDC data shows a death rate of about 0.1%.
