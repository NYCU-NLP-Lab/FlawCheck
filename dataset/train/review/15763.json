["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on August 1, 2018", "President Donald Trump is saying that the U.S. balance of trade improved by a \u201ctremendous\u201d $52 billion in the second quarter of 2018. But the correct figure is much smaller \u2014 $22 billion \u2014 as two economists with expertise in trade statistics have confirmed for us.", "Actually, the government hasn\u2019t yet released its official trade figures for the second quarter. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has only released figures covering through the end of May, and it will\u00a0publish June (and second quarter) figures Aug. 3.", "So where does Trump get the notion that \u201cthe quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by $52 billion,\u201d when it hasn\u2019t?", "That figure comes from the trade components of the BEA\u2019s estimate of gross domestic product released July 27. That\u2019s OK, in theory; the GDP trade figures closely parallel the more commonly used \u201ctrade in goods and services\u201d figures from BEA. The two differ only a little, due to differing coverage, definitions and timing of revisions. For example, the GDP figures count goods shipped between Puerto Rico and the 50 states as U.S. exports and imports, while the official trade figures count the island as part of the US.", "But Trump \u2014 or whoever came up with this figure \u2014 makes a couple of rookie errors in his calculations.", "Most important, the trade components of the quarterly GDP figures he uses are stated as annual rates, not as the actual value of imports and exports during the quarter. They are, in other words, four times larger than the actual value of imports and exports for the quarter.", "Also, Trump takes his figure from table 3b, which gives \u201creal\u201d or inflation-adjusted figures for net exports of goods and services. These are stated in 2012 dollars, not today\u2019s dollars.", "Correcting Trump\u2019s mistakes \u2014 taking the figures from table 3a to get the annual-rate figures in today\u2019s dollars, and dividing by four to get the actual value of imports and exports for the quarter \u2014 shows a drop in the second-quarter trade deficit of $21.7 billion from the previous quarter.", "That\u2019s notable to be sure.\u00a0The trade deficit \u2014 which totaled more than $570 billion during the most recent 12 months on record \u2014 has been going down since March, after rising at the beginning of 2018. It dropped 6.6 percent in May alone, as we noted in our recent update of \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers\u201d\u00a0(though, as we explained, exporters may have been trying to beat retaliatory tariffs from China). The deficit in the most recent three months on record (March, April and May) was nearly $24 billion less than in the three months immediately preceding, a drop of 15 percent.", "But Trump\u2019s mistaken figure of a $52 billion quarterly drop is a big exaggeration. We checked our calculations with two economists, who agreed.", "\u201cI got the same number as you got ($21.7 billion/quarter) using BEA quarterly data,\u201d said Lucy Lu, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an email exchange.", "And a government economist familiar with trade statistics told us, \u201cyou are correct to focus on current-dollar\u00a0values,\u201d not the 2012 dollars Trump uses, adding: \u201cAnd, as you note, the GDP\u00a0data are reported at annual rates. Simply dividing those values by 4 will result in quarterly rates.\u201d Trump did not do that. (This economist did not wish to be named or identified by agency.)", "Nevertheless, Trump has been repeating his bogus figure enthusiastically. In his July 27 remarks\u00a0touting the GDP report,\u00a0he called it \u201cone of the biggest wins\u201d\u00a0 and \u201ca tremendous drop.\u201d And at a July 30 press conference with Italy\u2019s prime minister,\u00a0he again boasted of a\u00a0\u201c52 billion reduction in the trade deficit for the quarter.\u201d", "Trump also said the $52 billion figure \u201cwas not reported very much.\u201d Turns out, there\u2019s good reason for that. The figure is wrong.", "Update, Aug. 3: The BEA released its June figures for trade in goods and services. Those figures show that the trade deficit went down by $20 billion from the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter (see Exhibit 1).", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
