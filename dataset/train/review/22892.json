(Rick Wood/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)", "Vice President Mike Pence is in Philadelphia on Monday to speak about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and attend a fundraiser for U.S. Senate candidate Lou Barletta. Protesters are expected to greet him, as they did\u00a0during an earlier visit\u00a0this year.", "Ahead of his trip, Pence published an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0in the\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0that declared the Trump administration\u2019s policies are benefitting Pennsylvania: \"Our agenda is delivering real results \u2013 and we\u2019re just getting started.\"", "Among the \"real results\" touted by Pence? That \"the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded.\"", "As jobs will likely be a major talking point during the midterm elections in Pennsylvania, we decided to check that statement.", "Most experts agree that presidents have\u00a0little\u00a0control\u00a0over the\u00a0economy. In his piece, Pence uses the unemployment rate for the Philadelphia area to bolster his argument that the Trump administration\u2019s policies are benefiting the city. But presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change.", "Experts also debate whether the unemployment rate is a\u00a0meaningful indicator\u00a0of the economy\u2019s well-being. That probably rings true for the 48 percent of city residents\u00a0living below the poverty line\u00a0or for those who have\u00a0stopped looking for work. But for the purposes of this fact-check, we stuck with the numbers.", "\"Based on data from the Philadelphia Metropolitan Division, the unemployment rate (4.7%) in May 2018 was the lowest ever recorded,\" the vice president\u2019s spokesperson, Alyssa Farah, said via email when asked about the source of the claim.", "Unemployment data comes from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The\u00a0Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division\u00a0is a\u00a0subset\u00a0of the\u00a0Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD\u00a0metropolitan statistical area and\u00a0includes\u00a0both Philadelphia and Delaware counties.", "BLS releases both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted Local Area Unemployment Statistics. The Pa. Department of Labor & Industry uses seasonally adjusted data, as it allows for month-to-month comparisons and accounts for trends like layoffs after the holiday season, analyst Jeff Newman told\u00a0PolitiFact Pennsylvania.", "For the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in May, according to BLS. That number is preliminary and will be finalized within a month, Newman said.", "That 4.7 percent rate is the lowest number on record since January 1990. That\u2019s as far back as BLS went when it\u00a0reconstructed\u00a0unemployment data based on MSA and metro division delineation changes that happened after the last census.", "Pence\u2019s claim would not be true using non-seasonally adjusted unemployment data. The unadjusted unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, according to BLS, and was lower in April 2000 (4.3 percent).", "Ahead of his visit to Philadelphia, Vice President Mike Pence claimed in an opinion piece that the unemployment rate for the city\u2019s metro area is the lowest on record.", "That is true only if one looks at seasonally adjusted unemployment data for the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division (which includes Delaware County) since 1990, which is important context.
