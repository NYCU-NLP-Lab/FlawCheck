["The Republican Party of Florida's mailer included a similar list of Alex Sink's tax positions as earlier fliers.", "Alex Sink\u2019s campaign for Pinellas County\u2019s open U.S. House seat has been under attack by Republicans resurrecting her positions on Florida taxes over the years.", "One such claim is rooted in Sink\u2019s record as the state\u2019s chief financial officer. A Republican Party of Florida campaign mailer that reached Pinellas County homes by Feb. 10 accused her of leaving out \"some key facts\" in one of her TV ads. The flier read, \"Alex Sink supported higher taxes. She has a long record of supporting higher taxes -- higher property taxes, higher sales taxes, even higher taxes on water and TV.\"", "We\u2019ve checked many of these claims before; we found the sales tax attack Mostly False, and the water and TV taxes claim Mostly True. But what about the property taxes?", "Back on the homestead", "The GOP said it was basing their accusation on a Jan. 23, 2008, story in the Tampa Bay Times in which then-CFO Sink voiced her opposition to Amendment 1, a ballot measure focusing on how the state\u2019s homestead exemption would be applied to property taxes.", "The amendment aimed to increase the exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits under the 1992 Save Our Homes Amendment, which capped assessment increases on homes, to a new residence. The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually.", "In the story, Sink was briefly mentioned as not supporting the measure because she was afraid of the potential loss of services that might happen if tax revenues fell. Specifically, she mentioned firefighters losing jobs, because they are paid with property taxes. She said her constituents largely shared her opposition.", "\"They're really more concerned about the little amount of money (they would get back) and the possible broader implications for our quality of life,\" Sink said.", "The GOP did not make any reference to a statement Sink made a day earlier, which clarified her stance on the measure.", "\"For 20 dollars a month, I'm not willing to take the risk that my fire service is going to be deteriorated, my schools aren't going to be supported, and I'm not going to get my potholes fixed,\" Sink told the Times Jan. 22, 2008, prior to the article Republicans cited.", "The piece noted that as Florida\u2019s fire marshal, a role the CFO assumes, she was hearing from fire chiefs statewide that they were worried about losing firefighters. Fire agencies relied solely on ad valorem taxes for their budgets.", "She said in the piece that she shared the views of Florida TaxWatch, which opposed Amendment 1. She also noted she didn\u2019t think tax policy should be a part of the state Constitution.", "\"If the policy's in the Constitution and it's not working right, how do you unwind it?\" Sink added.", "Her public position on the measure, which passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote, came up in June 2009 when she spoke before the Latin Builders Association in Miami to ramp up her campaign for governor. She said then that she couldn\u2019t recall how she voted on the amendment, drawing criticism from conservatives.", "Combined with a plunging real estate market during the Great Recession, the amendment led to a precipitous drop in tax revenues statewide. The expanded homestead exemption alone, which was retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008, took $93 billion out of coffers statewide in the first year, according to state records. The resultant budget cuts did eventually force many fire agencies to institute hiring freezes or cut personnel, including first responders, and delay or kill equipment purchases and capital improvements.", "Our ruling", "The Republican Party of Florida says Sink supported \"higher property taxes,\" referring to her somewhat lukewarm opposition to 2008\u2019s Save Our Homes Amendment 1, which adjusted property taxes in a way that lowered them for most homeowners.", "The claim is misleading in that it implies to voters she wanted to raise property taxes across the board. That wasn\u2019t the case; Sink wanted to keep taxes at the same level, not raise them.", "There\u2019s an element of truth here, but it leaves out context that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "Tampa Bay Buzz blog, \"Amendment 1 bad for Florida, Sink says,\" Jan. 22, 2008", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Tax vote foes speak softly,\" Jan. 23, 2008, accessed Feb. 20, 2014 via Nexis", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Voters flock to property tax relief, \" Jan. 30, 2008", "Destin Log, \"Amendment 1 \u2018not a killer\u2019 but it \u2018hurts\u2019,\" Feb. 2, 2008, accessed Feb. 21, 2014 via Nexis", "Florida Today, \"City avoids layoffs in 1st round of cuts,\" Feb. 29, 2009, accessed Feb. 21, 2014 via Nexis", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Extra penny could fund firefighters,\" March 2, 2008, accessed Feb. 21, 2014 via Nexis", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Fire cuts begin; 4 must go so far,\" March 2, 2008, accessed Feb. 21, 2014 via Nexis", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Fire rescue board cuts new hires, won\u2019t fire,\" April 4, 2008, accessed Feb. 21, 2014 via Nexis", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Amendment 1 delivers record plunge in Pinellas taxable property values,\" April 16, 2008", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Pinellas County Commission, fire service leaders at odds on tax,\" July 19, 2008", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Despite Amendment 1, Floridians are still trapped in their homes,\" Feb. 7, 2009", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Sink makes her case for governor to a GOP crowd in Miami,\" June 19, 2009", "Tampa Bay Buzz blog, \"Fasano blasts Sink's Amendment 1 amnesia,\" June 22, 2009", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Alex Sink supported 'more taxes on water and TV,' Republicans say,\" Jan. 27, 2014", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Alex Sink 'supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies,' NRCC says,\" Jan. 31, 2014", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Florida GOP says Alex Sink 'supported higher sales taxes,\u2019\" Feb. 21, 2014", "Ballotpedia, \"Florida Save Our Homes, Amendment 1 (January 2008),\" accessed Feb. 20, 2014", "Interview with Susan Hepworth, Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman, Feb. 19, 2014", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
