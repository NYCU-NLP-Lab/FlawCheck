["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf used his 2016-17 budget proposal address on Feb. 9 \u00a0to castigate Republican legislative leaders and introduce doomsday scenarios about what he says will happen if lawmakers don\u2019t address a rising structural deficit.", "During his address, Wolf chided the legislature as an eight-month long impasse from the 2015-16 budget continues, saying that \"if the General Assembly does not approve a responsible plan to solve this crisis,\" Pennsylvanians will begin to feel the consequences, teachers will be laid off and \"more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools.\"", "We decided to put that statement to the test. If Pennsylvania doesn\u2019t address its deficit in the 2016-17 budget, would 23,000 education professionals across the state really be \"immediately\" laid off?", "Wolf\u2019s spokesman Jeff Sheridan said that figure is based on a projection by the Department of Education examining what would happen if $1 billion was cut from public education funding in Pennsylvania. The Wolf administration says that total mandated spending for 2016-17 -- including to pensions, corrections and human services -- is about $32.5 billion.", "Without raising personal income or sales taxes, advocated by many Republican legislators, total revenue for 2016-17 is estimated at $30.2 billion, leaving the state with a more-than-$2 billion structural deficit. Sheridan said this deficit would lead to a $1 billion cut to education.", "Department of Education spokeswoman Casey Smith said based on that funding cut, about 599 administrators, 8,749 classroom teachers and 12,988 support staff would be laid off. That adds up to 22,336 positions.", "These projections were derived from public school staffing changes that took place after federal stimulus dollars under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were not renewed by Congress. When Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s administration was crafting its 2011-12 budget, it opted not to replace the stimulus dollars with state funds.", "That left school districts dealing with about $1 billion in funding cuts statewide over the course of the next several years. Those districts addressed the cuts through a combination of staff reductions, cost-cutting measures and property tax increases.", "James Paul, a policy analyst with the Harrisburg-based Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank, disagreed with the Wolf administration\u2019s assessment. Paul said the Wolf interpretation assumes the education system would bare the brunt of a projected shortfall if Wolf\u2019s budget proposal isn\u2019t adopted by the legislature.", "\"That is something that is inherently difficult to predict,\" Paul said, \"and it\u2019s unwise to make sweeping claims about teacher layoffs. I think any type of projection like that is more of a political comment.\"", "Mark Price, an analyst with the progressive Harrisburg-based Keystone Research Center, also said it\u2019s difficult to precisely estimate layoffs or other staff losses that would occur after another round of funding cuts to public education.", "\"It seems highly likely that another round of cuts in state aid would be met with a combination of layoffs, property tax increases and program cuts,\" Price said in an email.", "According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number employees in educational services in Pennsylvania did decrease by 23,000 under Corbett, but it wasn\u2019t immediate and not all the job loss could be tied specifically to budget cuts. In January 2011, there were 313,300 employees statewide in educational services. By January 2013, that number dropped to 290,300.", "Though those 23,000 staff cuts made through both layoffs and attrition were made over two years, Sheridan said the administration believes future layoffs would happen \"immediately\" if large budget cuts occurred today \"because districts are still suffering from the 2010-11 cuts.\"", "Our ruling", "During his fiery budget proposal address on Feb. 9, Wolf said Pennsylvania\u2019s ongoing budget problem is based on math, saying that if the Republican-controlled legislature doesn\u2019t address the state\u2019s structural deficit, \"more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools.\"", "Experts and analysts from organizations leaning toward both sides of the aisle say it\u2019s difficult to precisely estimate how local school districts would address funding cuts. His administration said that\u2019s based on cuts made after funding was slashed under former Gov. Tom Corbett.", "While the amount of educational service jobs in Pennsylvania did decrease by 23,000 positions by January 2013, those cuts took two years to play out and were not immediate, as Wolf\u2019s administration said would happen this time around if the same cuts were to occur.", "We rule the claim Mostly False.", "PowerPoint presentation, \"Structural Deficit PowerPoint,\" Scribd, Published by Gov.
