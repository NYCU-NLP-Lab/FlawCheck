The video said that India\u2019s 2008 score was 35.6 and in 2018, this number stood at 31.1. BJP implied that the country\u2019s index score has improved by 4.5 points (a lower GHI score implies better performance) in the last 10 years.", "However, the party got it wrong.", "BJP picked up the 35.6 value from GHI 2017 report and compared it with India\u2019s 2018 GHI index score, which is 31.1. However, the 2018 report clearly mentions that GHI scores are comparable within each year\u2019s report, but not between different years\u2019 reports because every year the scores are revised.", "The 2018 report also states that \u201ceach report includes GHI scores and indicator data for three reference years in addition to the focus year.

This is because a country\u2019s deteriorated ranking does not necessarily imply a fall in its index score, and vice-versa. For instance, India\u2019s GHI score in 2017 was 31.4 and its current score is 31.1. Even with the 0.3 point improvement, India\u2019s rank came down three places. This can be attributed to various factors, including a better performance by other countries.", "However, as GHI clarifies, previous years\u2019 index scores are comparable within the same report. BJP could have only referred to the 2018 report and compared the revised index scores of 2000, 2005 or 2010 and compared it with the current year\u2019s score (31.1) to show an improvement. Instead, the party picked up data from an entirely different report.", "Another misleading information provided by BJP\u2019s in its fact-check video was terming India\u2019s current Global Hunger Index score of 31.1 as \u201cnot alarming\u201d.
