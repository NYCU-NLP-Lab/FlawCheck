["The video was shared on\u00a0Facebook by an Australian-based user here on November 28.", "The man narrating the video shows a purported list of ingredients for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0He then focuses on a yellow tag which reads; \u201cLipid nanoparticles that carry and protect the mRNA from degradation\u201d.", "The narrator then says: \u201cWe know people have been talking about nanotechnology and being injected with nanotechnology. Well there it is, you have to say that is what\u2019s happening, nanotechnology is made of nanoparticles.\u201d", "The narrator then suggests Bill Gates could be\u00a0involved in creating the technology, echoing long-running Covid-19\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what's in those particles, but they are so f***in nano that just about you could definitely have little computers in there,\u201d the narrator claims.", "Nanotechnology is the manipulation or creation of materials and devices at the atomic scale. Nanoparticles are microscopic particles that measure less than 100 nanometres. Nano refers to a unit of size on the nanoscale, which is measured in billionths of the metre.", "The video has also been viewed thousands of times in multiple Facebook posts\u00a0here, here and here\u00a0alongside similar claims.", "The claims in the video, however, are misleading.", "Griffith University professor of infectious diseases, Nigel McMillan, told AFP in an email that \u201cno such technology exists at this time\u201d that would allow robots or computers to be encased in the lipid nanoparticles found in the new Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.", "The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which sends instructions to our cells to create a section of the spike protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus, according to the CDC. \u201cOur immune systems recognize that the protein doesn\u2019t belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies,\u201d the CDC adds.", "Professor McMillan said\u00a0the lipid nanoparticles found in the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0mRNA vaccine are a form of protection for the mRNA vaccine as they enter cells. \u201cThey [the lipid nanoparticles] are made of fats that either naturally occur in your body (eg think cholesterol) or are derived from plants (think margarine),\u201d he said in a December 8 email.", "Canadian biotechnology company Acuitas Therapeutics developed the lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine and described the process here, explaining: \u201cIn simple terms, it takes the mRNA safely through the body and delivers it into our cells, placing it exactly where it needs to be,\u201d the company said.", "Conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and false suggestions that he plans to\u00a0use the Covid-19 vaccine to microchip people have been circulating online throughout\u00a0the pandemic. The Bill Gates Foundations told AFP in June the claims were false.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
