At a March 12, 2020, forum hosted by the Milwaukee Bar Association, Kelly called the criticism a cheap political hit.", "Meanwhile, at the same forum, Karofsky called Kelly posing with an assault-style rifle \"a clearly partisan move.\"", "Even before that, Kelly\u2019s campaign made a stronger accusation in a March 3, 2020 email sent to supporters, in which Kelly claimed: \"Judge Karofsky and her radical liberal allies want to disarm law abiding citizens.\"", "Is the assertion correct?", "When asked to back up the claim, Kelly campaign manager Charles Nichols first pointed to a series of Karofsky tweets.", "\"In December 2019, Jill Karofsky called for increased gun control laws on Twitter following two incidents in Wisconsin schools,\" Nichols said in an email. \"Law enforcement later revealed that the weapons used in both incidents weren\u2019t actually guns.

What\u2019s more, it specifically describes finding ways that are constitutional to make any changes.", "\"Judge Karofsky has made it clear throughout this campaign that she supports the Second Amendment and the precedent established in the Heller decision,\" Karofsky spokesman Sam Roecker said in an email. \"Dan Kelly knows this precedent requires judges to uphold the law and an individual's right to own a gun.\"", "Kelly claimed Karofsky wants \"to disarm law abiding citizens.\"", "Rather than cite any past rulings as evidence, Kelly points to a series of tweets and a Karofsky quote in a newspaper story on the race.", "In both cases, Karofsky indicates she feels lawmakers should take steps to reduce gun violence -- even calling on them to \"step up to the plate.\"", "But nowhere did she call for disarming residents.
