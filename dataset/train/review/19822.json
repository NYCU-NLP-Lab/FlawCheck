But it was hard to ignore headlines in June 2011 that revealed that Justice Ann Walsh Bradley had accused Justice David Prosser of putting his hands around her neck.", "Other witnesses said Bradley came at Prosser with fists raised and he put up his hands to block her or push her back.\nThe June 2011 confrontation came during a discussion on the day before the high court released a 4-3 decision upholding Gov. Scott Walker's highly controversial bill to curtail the collective bargaining rights of public employees. A special prosecutor investigated the incident and decided not to file any criminal charges.", "On Feb. 13, 2013, news surfaced that Bradley had received stepped-up security from law enforcement more than two months before the incident.)", "Rancor on the court had already been an issue. In March 2011, it was revealed that 13 months earlier, Prosser called Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson a \"bitch\" and threatened to \"destroy\" her.

(Fallone spokesman Nathan Schwantes said Fallone focused on the January-through-August period because that's when the vast majority of opinions are issued during a term.)

But Fallone is mixing apples and oranges -- and ending up with an overcount.", "Sheehan, the state courts spokesman, told us that older reports, such as the two Fallone cited, combine civil and criminal opinions with opinions issued in attorney discipline cases, thus producing a higher total number of opinions. Reports in more recent years, he said, break out tallies for opinions issued in the three types of cases.", "Fallone also said his own \"hard count\" of opinions issued in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 indicate there were more than 100 opinions issued in civil and criminal cases in each term. But even if he were correct, that would indicate the number of opinions issued dropped off before 2008, which is when Fallone says tensions among the justices spiked upward.", "Going back further", "Fallone also cited a 2010 article in the magazine of the Wisconsin Public Research Institute, a conservative think tank, which argued that discord among the justices led to reduced productivity. The article said the state Supreme Court was issuing fewer opinions than it had in \"decades,\" but the statistics it cited lumped attorney discipline cases in with civil and criminal cases that were decided by opinion.", "We examined annual reports from the court dating to 1992, hoping to gather two decades\u2019 worth of data, but there were two problems. Reports issued before 2006-2007 did not provide separate statistics for opinions issued in civil and criminal cases -- the opinions in attorney discipline cases were included in the totals. Moreover, the tallies were on a calendar-year basis, rather than following the September-through-August Supreme Court terms, like the newer reports do.", "Our rating", "Citing incivility on the Supreme Court in the past several years, Fallone said the court's justices are \"deciding fewer opinions in civil and criminal cases than they used to.\"", "But he doesn\u2019t provide evidence to establish that.
