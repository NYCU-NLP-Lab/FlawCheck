["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on September 11, 2019", "A social media meme inaccurately claims that Walmart will no longer sell rifles. Walmart stopped selling \u201cmilitary-style rifles such as the AR-15,\u201d in 2015, and has announced it will no longer sell ammunition for \u201cmilitary-style weapons.\u201d It still sells \u201clong guns for hunting and sport shooting.\u201d", "After several mass shootings this summer, Walmart announced that it would stop selling handguns in the only remaining state where the store still offers them, and would stop selling handgun ammunition and ammunition that can be used in large-capacity clips on what it described as \u201cmilitary-style weapons.\u201d", "That decision drew condemnation from the National Rifle Association and conservative commentators. It also sparked a number of critical memes. One popular meme, though, includes inaccurate\u00a0 information. That meme has been shared more than 13,000 times and says: \u201c10,874 people killed by drunk drivers in 2017, and 403 by rifles. Walmart stops selling rifles. Still sells alcohol\u2026\u201d", "Walmart hasn\u2019t discontinued selling all rifles. The retailer still sells \u201clong guns for hunting and sport shooting, including shotguns, single-shot hunting rifles and light sporting rifles,\u201d according to its firearms and ammunition guidelines.", "On Sept. 3, though, the company announced that it would stop selling handguns\u00a0in Alaska, the only state where it currently sells them. Walmart\u00a0stopped selling handguns elsewhere in the country in the 1990s. Over the years, Walmart has made various changes to its gun-sales policy:", "These new changes, which Walmart announced on Sept. 3, will take effect after current inventories of these items are sold:", "As for the numbers quoted in the meme, those come from federal agencies.", "According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 10,874 people died in drunk-driving crashes in 2017. More than half of those people \u2014 6,618 in total \u2014 were the drunk drivers themselves, according to an NHTSA report.", "The other number quoted in the meme comes from the FBI\u2019s crime statistics for 2017. That year 403 people were murdered with rifles \u2014 not, as the meme claims, killed by rifles. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 39,773 people died from gunshot wounds in 2017 and most of those deaths \u2014 60% \u2014 were suicide. The FBI figure doesn\u2019t include suicides or accidental deaths.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
