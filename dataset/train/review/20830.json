["Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum speaks during a rally on the campus of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Fla., on Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. (Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP)", "A viral blog post claims that Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee in the Florida governor race is \"indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor in light of a fatal shooting in Tallahassee at a yoga studio on Friday.\" The article, posted to the site The Grio on Nov. 3, notes Gillum\u2019s response to Friday\u2019s shooting.", "\"I\u2019m deeply appreciative of law enforcement's quick response to the shooting at the yoga facility in Tallahassee today. No act of gun violence is acceptable. I'm in close communication with law enforcement officials and will be returning to Tallahassee tonight,\" Gillum tweeted Friday night.", "This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The blog post does little to justify its misleading headline and lead paragraph.", "The Grio article doesn\u2019t cite any source for Gillum\u2019s announcement to suspend his campaign \"indefinitely,\" but does outline what took place during Friday\u2019s shooting where Scott Paul Beierle killed two people and wounded five in a yoga studio in Tallahassee before killing himself, according to the Guardian.", "The Grio post notes that the gunman \"reportedly had a history of arrests for grabbing women,\" and links to a USA Today article published Nov. 3 that digs into Beierle\u2019s background. Emails sent to The Grio Saturday all bounced back. An email sent to the author of the article and messages sent to Gillum\u2019s campaign were not immediately returned.", "Gillum\u2019s tweet from Friday is quoted in the article, along with remarks the Tallahassee Democrat reported he made near where the shooting occurred.", "The Grio\u2019s post is similar to the Nov. 2 New York Daily News article with the headline, \"Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum suspends campaign after 2 dead in Tallahassee shooting.\"", "The Guardian wrote in its Nov. 3 article that Gillum \"tweeted that he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee.\" However, there\u2019s no evidence that Gillum is \"indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor\" following Friday\u2019s shooting like The Grio\u2019s post claims.", "In fact, Gillum is still campaigning.", "On Saturday afternoon, Palm Beach Post political reporter George Bennett tweeted photos of Gillum at a Jimmy Buffett concert being held to garner support for Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson. The concert in West Palm Beach was being held \"to rally voters before Election Day on Tuesday,\" according to a Nov. 1 Miami Herald article announcing the concert.", "Bennett tweeted pictures of Gillum with Norman Lear and Nelson, noting that both Gillum and Nelson \"went with the khaki/blue shirt combo\" for the rally.", "Gillum also retweeted Bay News 9 and News 13 Florida capitol reporter Troy Kinsey\u2019s Nov. 3 tweet that showed Gillum onstage speaking to the crowd in West Palm Beach.", "Similarly, the Orlando Sentinel reported Nov. 2 that Gillum was scheduled to join other politicians and celebrities at the University of Central Florida to rally students Saturday.", "In campaign press releases sent Saturday, Gillum\u2019s campaign said campaign events would be taking place throughout the day.", "\"On Saturday, November 3, the Gillum for Governor \u2018Bring It Home\u2019 bus tour will continue with stops across South and Central Florida. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam will campaign for Mayor Gillum in Lake Worth, followed by a \"Get Out the Vote\" event at UCF and concluding the day at a Jimmy Buffett GOTV concert in West Palm Beach,\" a campaign email sent at 12:06 a.m. on Nov. 3 said.", "A Nov. 3 Spectrum News 13 story also showed what Gillum was up to Saturday, with time stamped updates.", "A post from The Grio claimed that Gillum is \"indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor in light of a fatal shooting in Tallahassee at a yoga studio on Friday.\" While Gillum did leave the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee and met with some of the victims, he is not ending his campaign for governor because of the shooting.", "We rate this claim False.", "The Grio, \"Andrew Gillum suspends campaign for Governor after 2 killed in Tallahassee shooting,\" Nov. 3, 2018", "Andrew Gillum\u2019s tweet, Nov. 2, 2018", "The Guardian, \"Florida yoga studio shooting: two killed before class members tackle gunman,\" Nov. 3, 2018", "USA Today, \"Scott Beierle, suspected gunman in Tallahassee yoga studio shooting, had history of arrests for grabbing women,\" Nov. 2, 2018", "Tallahassee Democrat, \"Andrew Gillum: One wounded victim was shot nine times in Tallahassee yoga studio shooting,\" Nov. 3, 2018", "New York Daily News, \"Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum suspends campaign after 2 dead in Tallahassee shooting,\" Nov. 2, 2018", "The Miami Herald, \"Jimmy Buffett to perform free concert for candidates Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson,\" Nov. 1, 2018", "George Bennett\u2019s tweet, Nov. 3, 2018", "George Bennett\u2019s tweet, Nov. 3, 2018", "Troy Kinsey\u2019s tweet, Nov. 3, 2018", "CBS News, \"Obama campaigns for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson in Florida,\" Nov. 2, 2018", "Orlando Sentinel, \"Andrew Gillum to rally at UCF Saturday with rapper Common, politicians,\" Nov. 2, 2018", "Spectrum News 13, \"ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL: Gillum back on trail at UCF, DeSantis in Lakeland, Daytona,\" Nov. 3, 2018", "Gillum for Governor campaign emails, Nov. 3, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
