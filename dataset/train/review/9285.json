["By Lori Robertson, Eugene Kiely, Rem Rieder, Jessica McDonald, Robert Farley and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on August 10, 2020", "President Donald Trump made several false, misleading\u00a0and\u00a0exaggerated\u00a0claims in press briefings he held Aug. 7 and 8 at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, spinning the facts on COVID-19 and the economy, among other topics:", "The\u00a0HEROES Act, or the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act,\u00a0passed\u00a0the Democratic-controlled House in May by a vote of 208-199. (One Republican\u00a0voted\u00a0in favor; 14 Democrats voted against.) But negotiations broke down on Aug. 7 between the White House and congressional Democratic leaders to find a coronavirus relief bill both sides could support.", "Trump spoke about the Democratic bill, his executive orders on relief efforts, the coronavirus pandemic and more in the Aug. 7 and 8 press briefings.", "On Aug. 8, Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0that directs his administration to identify federal funds \u201cto provide temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners\u201d and \u201cto promote the ability of renters and homeowners to avoid eviction or foreclosure\u201d due to the coronavirus.", "In signing the order, Trump falsely claimed that \u201cthe Democrats don\u2019t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction,\u201d even though the House Democrats had already passed a bill to do exactly that.", "Trump, Aug. 8:\u00a0So I\u2019m protecting people from eviction. Yet you\u2019ve been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don\u2019t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s do that separately. That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live.\u201d And they didn\u2019t even want to protect people from eviction.", "In fact, the House \u2014 without a single Republican vote \u2014\u00a0passed\u00a0the\u00a0Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act, which would provide $100 billion for emergency rental assistance and create a $75 billion homeowners assistance fund. It also would extend the\u00a0eviction and foreclosure moratorium\u00a0for certain renters and homeowners that was put in place by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act.", "The CARES Act protected \u201cmost residents of federally subsidized apartments, including those supported by HUD, USDA or Treasury (Low Income Housing Tax Credit developments) as well a moratorium on filings for evictions for renters in homes covered by federally-backed (FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac) mortgages\u201d for 120 days,\u00a0according to\u00a0the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The moratorium expired July 24, but the House Democratic bill would extend the protections\u00a0until March 2021.", "The Senate Republicans\u00a0did not\u00a0include an extension of the eviction protections in their package of coronavirus relief bills.", "Trump made the curious claim that he would pursue an executive order to require \u201chealth insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers,\u201d claiming this had \u201cnever been done before.\u201d The Affordable Care Act already enacted such preexisting conditions protections.", "The ACA, signed by then-President Barack Obama in 2010, prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, charging them higher premiums or excluding coverage of certain conditions based on health status.", "The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 website says these protections went into effect in 2014: \u201cThese rules went into effect for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 7: Over the next two weeks, I\u2019ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers. That\u2019s a big thing. I\u2019ve always been very strongly in favor \u2014 we have to cover pre-existing conditions. So we will be pursuing a major executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all of its customers.", "This has never been done before, but it\u2019s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of.", "Trump acknowledged to reporters on Aug. 10 that this executive order would simply reinforce what the ACA had already done. \u201cJust a double safety net and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally and strongly in favor of preexisting conditions, taking care of people with preexisting conditions,\u201d he said. Trump justified his \u201cnever been done before\u201d comment by saying \u201cas an executive order, it hasn\u2019t been done before.\u201d", "Of course, an executive order restating existing law wouldn\u2019t change anything.", "The Trump administration has actually worked to reduce the preexisting condition protections under the ACA in several ways. It has backed a lawsuit to nullify the law, even arguing at one point that preexisting condition provisions would have to go if the suit were succesful. The administration later backed the full invalidation of the health care law. (The Supreme Court should hear arguments for that case \u2014 California v. Texas \u2014 in the fall, with a decision not expected until next year.)", "Trump also supported Republican health care legislation in 2017 that would have included some, but not all, of the ACA\u2019s protections. And the president pushed the expansion of cheaper short-term health plans that wouldn\u2019t have to abide by the ACA\u2019s protections, including prohibitions against denying or pricing coverage based on health status.", "In claiming that the U.S. is \u201cdoing very well\u201d with the coronavirus, Trump boasted in the Aug. 7 briefing of the large number of U.S. counties with fewer than 20 cases of COVID-19.", "\u201cMore than half of America\u2019s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week,\u201d he said.", "Data from\u00a0USAFacts, a not-for-profit that supplies data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that the president is correct, if using cases reported between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7. In that time span, 1,635 counties or county equivalents had fewer than 20 COVID-19 cases, versus 1,507 with 20 or more.", "But what Trump does not share is the number of people who live in those areas \u2014 less than 31 million, or 9.4% of the U.S. population. That means more than 90% of the American population lives in a county with 20 or more COVID-19 cases.", "The numbers flip if looking for new cases reported between July 31 and Aug. 7, which covers the full past week. In that timeframe, 1,608 counties or county equivalents \u2014 accounting for 91.5% of the population \u2014 had 20 or more cases, versus 1,534 below that threshold.", "Trump then proceeded to overstate\u00a0the progress seen in the nation\u2019s surveillance system.", "\u201cNationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July,\u201d Trump said.", "But data from the CDC does not show that much of a drop. On Aug. 7, the CDC\u00a0released\u00a0its figures for the week ending Aug. 1, which found 2.9% of emergency room visits were for a COVID-19-like illness. That\u2019s an improvement from three weeks prior, when the\u00a0July peak\u00a0was at 4.1%. But it\u2019s only a 29% decline, not one of almost 50%.", "Later, Trump returned to one of his favorite topics: COVID-19 testing.", "Trump, Aug. 7:\u00a0The United States is only 5% of the world\u2019s population, but we have conducted over 25% of the world\u2019s testing. Think of that: 5% and we\u2019ve given 25% of the world\u2019s testing. Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we\u2019re constantly showing cases \u2014 cases, cases, cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up, because we\u2019re doing \u2014 one of the reasons \u2014 we\u2019re doing a lot of testing. We\u2019re doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests where other countries have done very little testing.", "Trump is right that the number of confirmed cases needs to take testing into account. But as we have\u00a0explained\u00a0before, the large number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. isn\u2019t just due to testing; it also stems from increased transmission of the virus. And many other countries are still doing more testing per coronavirus case \u2014 meaning they are doing more testing for the size of their outbreaks.", "Figures from Our World in Data\u00a0show that as of Aug. 10, or around that date, the U.S. has done only 12.4 tests per COVID-19 case, which is below the majority of the rest of the world. New Zealand has done a whopping 407; Australia, 235; and South Korea, 110.", "It\u2019s difficult to know what percentage of the world\u2019s tests the U.S. has done because data is missing for numerous countries and countries report test data differently. The White House did not explain how the president arrived at his 25% claim. But according to the information available\u00a0on Worldometer, the U.S. accounts for about 17.8% of all tests to date. That includes 90 million tests in China, which if correct, would be more than the U.S.\u2019s 66 million tests. If leaving out all tests from China \u2014 an extreme underestimation \u2014 the U.S.\u2019s percentage swells to 23.6%.", "The U.S. is actually 4.3% of the world population,\u00a0per\u00a0the Census Bureau, not quite 5%. More critically, Trump highlighted testing percentage, which is uncertain, but did not also share that the U.S. has 25% of the world\u2019s coronavirus cases and 22% of the world\u2019s coronavirus deaths,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. Caveats about reporting aside, it\u2019s clear that the U.S. has a disproportionate number of both cases and deaths, given its population.", "Trump also falsely\u00a0said\u00a0that if the Democrats controlled Washington, they would pass \u201clegislation gutting every single police department in America.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 7:\u00a0If the Democrats controlled in Washington \u2014 the Democrats\u2019 control of Washington \u2014 they\u2019d pass \u2014 with all of the things they do \u2014 legislation gutting every single police department in America. They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department. At a minimum, they\u2019re to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department.\u00a0No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe. Your suburbs would be a disaster. Your cities, your towns would be a disaster.", "First of all, even if the Democrats in Washington wanted to, they would not be able to do much \u201cgutting\u201d of police spending. According to a\u00a0backgrounder\u00a0by the Urban Institute, 86% of police funding in 2017 was from local governments, with additional money ponied up by state governments. \u201cNearly all spending on both police and corrections was funded by state and local governments because federal grants account for a very small share of both expenditures,\u201d the report said.", "But there is no reason to think they want to. As we have\u00a0written, presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said several times that he is opposed to defunding the police. \u201cWhile I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,\u201d the former vice president said in a\u00a0June 10 op-ed.", "A campaign spokesman also told us Biden supports more funding for police for initiatives to strengthen community relationships and for body-worn cameras.", "That hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from making the false claim about Biden, as he did in a highly publicized\u00a0interview\u00a0with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d which aired on July 19. Wallace quickly pointed out that Biden didn\u2019t support defunding the police. And it hasn\u2019t stopped the Trump campaign from running a\u00a0series of ads\u00a0suggesting criminals would run amok in a Biden administration. The ads, which feature images of rioting and mayhem and ringing but unanswered police telephones, convey the message that people \u201cwon\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America.\u201d", "Trump also falsely claimed in the Wallace interview that \u201cdefunding the police\u201d was called for in a collection of recommendations put together by supporters of Biden and his vanquished rival in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. That also is false. There is no mention of it in the\u00a0recommendations\u00a0of the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force.", "There is no agreed upon definition for the\u00a0term\u00a0\u201cdefund the police.\u201d Some critics of the police, who believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement, really do want to abolish police forces and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. Others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies.", "But Trump\u2019s comments and campaign ads depict defunding the police as meaning taking away significant amounts of money, crippling law enforcement.", "In one interview, Biden did say he was open to the idea in some cases of shifting some funds from the police to social service agencies. But Biden said in the same interview,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police.\u201d", "Nothing Biden has said backs up the idea that he would seek legislation \u201cgutting\u201d law enforcement and making Americans unsafe.", "Trump falsely\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201ceverybody\u201d \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 was in favor of the payroll tax cut he has long sought.", "Reporter, Aug. 8:\u00a0Sir, the payroll tax cut was opposed by both parties on Capitol Hill. Can you give your rationale as to why you think that\u2019s important, particularly since it doesn\u2019t help Americans who (inaudible)?", "Trump:\u00a0Yeah. Okay. It helps people greatly. It helps our country get back. And anybody that would say anything different, I think, is very foolish. Everybody wanted it. By the way, the Democrats want it. The Republicans want it. They just couldn\u2019t get it \u2014 they just couldn\u2019t come to an agreement, but everybody wants it. And the very important thing is the people want it, and the people need it, actually.", "But that is not the case. Democrats have resisted\u00a0cutting or suspending the payroll tax. And Republicans, who have loyally supported the president on many issues, have expressed little enthusiasm for the idea. Even before the talks on the latest coronavirus assistance legislation\u00a0broke down, the White House\u00a0gave up\u00a0on the payroll tax cut in the face of GOP opposition.", "For example, Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0reporters on July 21, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of that. I\u2019ve been very clear about that. We\u2019ll see what it looks like, but if it\u2019s a choice between doing [stimulus] checks and a payroll-tax cut, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the checks have a more direct benefit to the economy.\u201d", "Sen. Charles Grassley, a Kansas Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also expressed reservations. \u201cGo to the fact that Social Security people think we\u2019re raiding the Social Security fund,\u201d Grassley\u00a0said\u00a0on July 20. \u201cAnd we are raiding it, but we have always put in general fund revenue in it so it is made whole. But that creates \u2014 it might create political problems \u2014 but it creates a public relations problem.\u201d", "In a television\u00a0interview\u00a0on July 24, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, generally a staunch ally of the president, explained why the payroll tax provision would be left out of the legislation. He said there was \u201cbipartisan opposition\u201d to the idea, adding, \u201cI think we\u2019re a lot better off just to send another direct cash payment to those who\u2019ve been left out of all of this. It\u2019s the quickest and easiest way to get relief. A payroll tax [cut], of course, would only help those who have a job.\u201d", "From the outset, Democrats on Capitol Hill were against the idea. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer\u00a0said\u00a0on July 21 that a payroll tax cut \u201cnot only will harm those who rely on Social Security, but will do nothing for the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs during this crisis.\u201d", "Trump claimed in the Aug. 8 briefing that \u201cthe Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.\u201d That\u2019s true only for some individuals living in the U.S. illegally who also file federal income taxes.", "The\u00a0HEROES Act\u00a0includes\u00a0another\u00a0$1,200 refundable tax credit \u2014 paid in advance \u2014 for eligible individuals and households based on their 2018 or 2019 federal income tax returns. The credit is $1,200 for single taxpayers and $2,400 for joint filers. An additional $1,200 would be available for each dependent up to a maximum of three dependents. For individuals, the tax credit phases out starting at $75,000 of modified adjusted gross income. For heads of households and joint filers, the income cutoffs are $112,500 and $150,000, respectively.", "Unlike the\u00a0Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law in late March, the HEROES Act would make the \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d available to those who filed federal income taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN.", "ITINs\u00a0are used\u00a0by individuals \u2014 including people living in the U.S. illegally \u2014 who file their taxes and do not have, or are not eligible to receive, a Social Security number. \u201cIn 2015, 4.4 million ITIN filers paid over $5.5 billion in payroll and Medicare taxes and $23.6 billion in total taxes,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0a 2015 report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service.", "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0has argued\u00a0that those people should\u2019ve never been\u00a0left out\u00a0of the CARES Act, which\u00a0denied\u00a0stimulus payments of similar amounts to individuals without \u2014 or joint filers married to someone without \u2014 a Social Security number.", "The HEROES Act would make some taxpayers who filed with ITINs \u2014 and meet other requirements \u2014\u00a0retroactively eligible\u00a0for payments under the CARES Act as well.", "Trump boasted of job growth since May, but neglected to mention the historic job losses that preceeded it.", "In his Aug. 7 remarks, Trump correctly said the U.S. had \u201cadded 1.8 million new jobs in July\u201d and exaggerated slightly in saying the job growth totaled \u201cover 9.3 million jobs since May.\u201d It was just under that: 9,279,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "\u201cAnd I will say that the job growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last three months \u2014 9.3 million \u2014 is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history,\u201d he continued.", "BLS data on employment, dating back to 1939, shows no other three-month period coming close to the magnitude of that job growth; however, no other two-month period comes close to the job loss in March and April. Those losses totaled 22.2 million.", "The unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April and was 10.2% in July. In February, the U.S. rate was 3.5%.", "Trump touted a drop in the unemployment rate for Latinos, saying, \u201cHispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32%.\u201d That\u2019s the drop in the unemployment rate, from 18.9% in April to 12.9% in July, a decline of 6 percentage points. The rate was 4.4% in February.", "He also cited a record for African Americans: \u201cJobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns \u2014 incredibly hard \u2014 increased by nearly 1 million over the past three months, and that\u2019s also a record. That\u2019s a job record: African American, 1 million. It\u2019s job record.\u201d", "Similar to the job losses and gains for the U.S. as a whole, African American employment has rebounded somewhat, with the gain of 921,000 jobs from May through July. But that comes after 3.5 million jobs lost in March and April.", "Trump exaggerated in claiming the\u00a0Democratic relief bill\u00a0would \u201crequire the mass release of illegal aliens from detention\u201d and \u201ccompel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 8:\u00a0They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons. How do you like that one? And this is in the bill that we\u2019re talking about? What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy? What does this have to do with the coronavirus?", "The\u00a0$3 trillion\u00a0House bill, known as the HEROES Act, includes provisions that are designed to reduce populations in crowded federal facilities, such as immigration detention centers and prisons, to prevent coronavirus outbreaks.", "In a section known as the \u201cPandemic Justice Response Act,\u201d the bill would require the release of inmates who are within 12 months of being released from prison, or those who are juveniles or over 50 years old, or have a \u201ccovered health condition,\u201d such as diabetes, heart disease and chronic lung disease. Such inmates would be subject to community supervision for the remainder of their prison sentences.", "The director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons \u201cmay not place in community supervision any individual determined, by clear and convincing evidence, to be likely to pose a specific and substantial risk of causing bodily injury to or using violent force against the person of another,\u201d the bill states.", "It is worth noting the bill would apply only to federal prisons \u2014 which hold a small percentage of those incarcerated in the U.S. Of the nearly 2.2 million people incarcerated in the U.S. in 2016, only 188,000 \u2014 or 8.7% \u2014 were held in federal prisons,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Bureau of Justice Statistics (table 3). There are currently only about 157,000 federal inmates,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Federal Bureau of Prisons.", "In the case of immigrant detainees, the Democratic bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to review immigration files of all detainees and release those \u201cwho are not subject to mandatory detention laws\u201d and not a \u201cthreat to public safety or national security.\u201d", "Those subject to mandatory detention (and therefore not eligible for release under the Democratic bill) have been convicted of crimes \u201cinvolving moral turpitude,\u201d such as drug offenses, human trafficking and money laundering, or specific offenses, such as aggravated felony and firearm offenses, according to a\u00a02019 report\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "The Democratic bill is consistent with existing law. The Immigration and Nationality Act \u201cpermits aliens who are not subject to mandatory detention to be released on bond or on their own recognizance,\u201d according to the CRS report.", "The bill is also consistent with current ICE enforcement policy. In mid-March, ICE\u00a0announced\u00a0that because of the pandemic it would temporarily adjust its enforcement priorities to \u201cfocus enforcement on public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds\u201d \u2014 the two groups that would still be detained under the Democratic bill.", "Since announcing its new enforcement policy, the detainee population has declined from\u00a037,888\u00a0on March 7 to\u00a021,546\u00a0on Aug. 1, and the percentage of detainees with criminal convictions has increased from 38% to 53%.", "So, the Democratic bill is consistent with existing immigration law and current ICE enforcement policy.", "Trump again wrongly claimed that Biden \u201cwants to rip down the wall\u201d the Trump administration has constructed along the Mexican border.

Less than four miles of fencing has been built where there was no fencing before.", "Biden has not said he would tear down the fencing that has been constructed by the Trump administration, nor has he advocated for open borders. To the contrary, in an\u00a0Aug. 5 interview, NPR reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro asked Biden directly, \u201cTrump campaigned on \u2018Build that wall.\u2019 Are you willing to tear that wall down?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d\u00a0Biden responded, \u201cthere will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration. \u2026 I\u2019m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it\u2019s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry \u2014 that\u2019s where all the bad stuff is happening.\u201d", "For nearly two years, Trump has been spreading a bogus tale that he was responsible for enacting legislation to create the Veterans Choice program, when, in fact, that legislation was signed by Obama in 2014.", "The president again made the claim in his Aug. 8 press briefing, saying, \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no president\u2019s ever been able to do it, and we got it done so veterans have choice.\u201d", "That echoes Trump\u2019s prior claims that it\u2019s something people had been \u201ctrying to get\u201d for \u201calmost 50 years,\u201d or \u201c44 years.\u201d He has even claimed the program \u2014 which allows veterans to receive care from non-VA health care providers if they were unable to get timely appointments or face long travel to VA facilities \u2014 was his idea, calling it \u201cthe greatest idea I think I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d", "The Veterans Choice legislation passed easily in August 2014, with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. Only eight lawmakers in Congress opposed the final bill.

It was passed in 2014. \u2026 But it\u2019s a false statement, sir.", "Trump: Okay, thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
