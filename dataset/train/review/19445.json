It was posted\u00a0twice on Facebook by The Political Insider, a conservative news and media website, which initially\u00a0said, \"This may be Joe Biden's most humiliating gaffe yet.\" It linked to an article by the publication that commented at length on the speech, though it does not note that Biden was trying to recite the entire pledge.
