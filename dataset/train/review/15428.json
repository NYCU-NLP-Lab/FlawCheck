This problem is exacerbated by the use of screenshots and images of fake accounts that may be taken from one social media platform and shared on another. For example, Facebook users may not be familiar with spoof accounts on Twitter and might end up sharing fake messages. Typically, the blue tick feature of Twitter is used to indicate authenticity of accounts of many individuals and especially celebrities. However, tweets from parody accounts are often mistaken to be those of actual persons since there are no visual markers to suggest that a particular tweet has been posted from a parody account.
