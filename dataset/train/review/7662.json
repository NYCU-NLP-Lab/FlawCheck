In fact, Iran has more holders of American Ph.D.s in its presidential cabinet than France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, or Spain \u2014 combined.", "What\u2019s the significance? The cabinet of scholars could launch a new chapter in Iran\u2019s typically troubled relations with western countries and negotiations over its nuclear program -- or not, Na\u00edm wrote, since the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ultimately calls the shots.", "\"But compared to the kind of people that Ahmadinejad had in his cabinet, they were a very different kind of crowd,\" Na\u00edm told PunditFact by phone. \"So one would expect people with American Ph.D.s to be more sophisticated, more integrated in the world.\"", "His piece singled out three Iranian cabinet officials from the 30-position body with American degrees. PunditFact verified each of the following officials graduated from these American universities:", "Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, Rouhani\u2019s chief of staff, was awarded a Ph.D. in economics on Jan. 30, 1994, from George Washington University.", "Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country\u2019s foreign affairs minister, completed his Ph.D. in international law and politics at the University of Denver in 1988.

His minister of information and communications technology, Mahmoud Vaezi, enrolled at a doctoral program at Louisiana State University after studying at other American schools but ended up finishing his Ph.D. in international relations at Warsaw University in Poland. Even Rouhani earned a doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, and several other members have advanced degrees from Iranian universities.", "Rouhani\u2019s cabinet has an important role in preparing policy and budgets, but it\u2019s not all that powerful because decisions can be overruled by the supreme leader\u2019s office and the Guardian Council, which is appointed by the supreme leader and considers legislation, said Alex Vatanka, an expert on Iran at the Middle East Institute. The U.S. Cabinet does not face similar wildcards, he said.", "\"There is no sort of element of surprise in the middle of it with one of the priests coming from nearby churches saying, \u2018No, no, this is ungodly and shouldn\u2019t be done\u2019,\" Vatanka said.", "\"The cabinet has been a way for the president to cautiously advance a reform agenda in Iran,\" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.", "He pointed out that another Rouhani adviser who is not in the cabinet, Mahmood Sariolghalam, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.", "How does Obama\u2019s Cabinet compare?", "There are a couple of ways of looking at Obama\u2019s Cabinet, and neither measure produces more doctoral degrees from American universities than the three we confirmed in Iran.

Of those, just one has an American Ph.D.", "Ernest Moniz, Obama\u2019s energy secretary, has no fewer than four honorary degrees.
