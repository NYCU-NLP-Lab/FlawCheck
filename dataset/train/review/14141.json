["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 15, 2020 | Updated on August 16, 2023", "At a campaign rally in Iowa, President Donald Trump cited an unsubstantiated news report to revive a widely debunked false narrative about Joe Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration.", "As we have reported more than once last year, Biden traveled to Kyiv as vice president and warned Ukraine\u2019s then-president, Petro Poroshenko, that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees until Ukraine removed its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who was widely viewed as corrupt.", "At the time, the international community and anti-corruption advocates in Ukraine were also calling for Shokin to be removed from office for his failure to aggressively prosecute corruption.", "But Trump has repeatedly distorted the facts about Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine to baselessly accuse his Democratic rival of seeking Shokin\u2019s removal to help his son, Hunter, who at the time was a board member of a Ukraine gas company called Burisma. He left the board in 2019.", "In Des Moines, Iowa, on Oct. 14, Trump cited \u201cexplosive documents\u201d published earlier that day by the New York Post to revive his widely discredited claim that Biden \u201cwent to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for.\u201d", "As\u00a0we\u2019ve written, there\u2019s no evidence Hunter Biden was being investigated.", "The president made this line of attack against Biden a central campaign theme last year \u2014 until a whistleblower last fall alleged Trump had pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25, 2019, phone call to investigate Burisma, Biden and his son, Hunter. The administration released a memo of the phone call that confirmed the whistleblower\u2019s account, and a subsequent House investigation confirmed that the Trump administration withheld U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky to publicly announce that he would launch the investigations sought by Trump.", "As a result, the president was impeached by the House in December for abusing his office and obstructing the House investigation.", "Undeterred, the president at the Iowa rally cited unverified emails allegedly sent and received by Hunter Biden that had been obtained by the New York Post from Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as evidence that \u201cJoe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son\u2019s corrupt business dealings.\u201d", "But the Post story and Hunter Biden\u2019s emails \u2014 which may or may not be authentic \u2014 don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s claims.", "In one of several stories on Hunter Biden, the New York Post wrote about a \u201csmoking-gun email\u201d that it claims proves the Democratic presidential nominee helped his son and Burisma. The story is based on a photo of an email that Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma, allegedly sent to Hunter Biden to \u201cthank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.\u201d We have no way to verify that the email is authentic.", "The Biden campaign says \u201cno meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place\u201d because it wasn\u2019t on Biden\u2019s schedule. Of course, that isn\u2019t evidence a meeting didn\u2019t occur \u2014 but the email (if authentic) isn\u2019t evidence that a meeting did occur, either. The New York\u00a0Post did not confirm that the meeting happened, and it\u2019s unclear from the email if the meeting did occur.", "\u201cThere was no meeting. Period. I was in all of the Vice President\u2019s meetings that touched on Ukraine, and I\u2019d never heard of this guy until now,\u201d Mike Carpenter, who was Biden\u2019s lead adviser for Ukraine at the time, said in a statement provided to us by the campaign. \u201cThis has all the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.\u201d", "Update, Aug. 16, 2023: Pozharskyi met Joe Biden and others at a dinner in Washington, D.C., in April 2015 \u2013 which is when Pozharskyi reportedly sent Hunter Biden the email mentioned in the New York Post story. Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partner, discussed the dinner during a closed-door interview with the House oversight committee on July 31, 2023, according to a transcript of the interview. However, Archer said business was not discussed at the dinner and that Joe Biden had nothing to do with Hunter Biden\u2019s business ventures.", "We asked the Biden campaign about the authenticity of the emails and the claim that the laptop belonged to Hunter Biden, and it referred us to Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney. We will update this story if we get a response.", "Citing another email from that same story, Trump said that \u201cthe same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an email saying quote \u2018we urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence.\u2019 In other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his vice president father who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia.\u201d", "Trump is referring to a May 12, 2014, email Pozharskyi allegedly sent to Hunter Biden that asked for \u201cadvice on how you could use your influence\u201d to help Burisma. Again, we don\u2019t know if the email is authentic, but even so, the email isn\u2019t evidence that Hunter Biden agreed to use his \u201cinfluence\u201d with his father to help Burisma. And it certainly isn\u2019t evidence that Joe Biden did anything to help Burisma.", "Another story by the New York Post published the same day included an April 13, 2014, memo purportedly written by Hunter Biden to one of his partners, Devon Archer. The New York Post says in the memo Hunter Biden \u201crepeatedly mentioned \u2018my guy\u2019 while apparently referring to then-Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d", "The memo said: \u201cThe announcement of my guys [sic] upcoming travels should be characterized as part of our advice and thinking- but what he will say and do is out of our hands.\u201d It was written about a week before Biden, as vice president, visited Kyiv, where he talked about anti-corruption efforts during a press conference with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in the wake of the Ukrainian revolution.", "Update, Aug. 16, 2023: In his July 31 testimony, Archer discussed the April 2014, memo, although his attorney, Matthew Schwartz, said he could not authenticate any emails produced by the committee. Archer said the email was an example of Hunter Biden taking credit for his father\u2019s trip, even though he had nothing to do with it. Hunter Biden gave Burisma executives the \u201cillusion of access to his father, other than social,\u201d such as a dinner, Archer said. For more about Archer\u2019s interview, read \u201cRepublicans Oversell Archer\u2019s Testimony About Hunter and Joe Biden.\u201d", "Biden\u2019s April 22, 2014, press conference came a few months after\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych, the former pro-Russia president of Ukraine, fled to Russia during\u00a0the revolution.", "\u201cUkrainians have also made clear that after an era of staggering public theft \u2014 not debt, public theft \u2014 that they will no longer accept corruption from public officials,\u201d Biden said at the press conference. \u201cYour former leader had to run in hiding for fear that after everyone saw the excesses to which his theft had taken him and others. The fact of the matter is I\u2019m of the view \u2014 and it\u2019s presumptuous to ever tell another man what his country thinks \u2014 but I\u2019m of the view that Ukrainians east, west, north and south are just sick and tired of the corruption.\u201d", "Under the new regime, Shokin became\u00a0prosecutor general in early 2015. But he failed \u201cto indict any major figures from the Yanukovych administration for corruption,\u201d according to\u00a0testimony\u00a0that John E. Herbst, a\u00a0former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine\u00a0under President George W. Bush, gave in March 2016 to a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "\u201cUkraine has had a long line of prosecutors whose function has not been to enforce the law, but to perform the political function of selectively prosecuting political enemies and to hold out the threat of prosecution in order to secure political loyalty and compliance. Shokin was precisely that kind of prosecutor,\u201d\u00a0Keith Darden, an associate professor at American University\u2019s School of International Service, told us in an email for a story last year. \u201cHe would open cases as a way of holding the threat of prosecution over a business, but he did not actually prosecute cases.\u201d", "Biden later publicly disclosed that on another trip to Kyiv he told Ukraine\u2019s new leadership that Shokin needed to be removed, warning that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees until Shokin was replaced. (Biden did not say when he made the threat, but he addressed the Ukrainian Parliament in Kyiv on\u00a0Dec. 9, 2015, and dangled the prospect of future U.S. aid if the country rid itself of the \u201ccancer of corruption.\u201d)", "\u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u201d Biden recalled in remarks at an event hosted in January 2018 by the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u201d", "Trump repeatedly cites Biden\u2019s January 2018 remarks as evidence that the former vice president pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin because he was investigating Burisma.", "But, as we said, the evidence shows Biden was carrying out U.S. policy, and the United States was not alone in pressuring Ukraine to fire Shokin.", "In February 2016, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde\u00a0threatened\u00a0to withhold $40 billion unless Ukraine undertook \u201ca substantial new effort\u201d to fight corruption after the country\u2019s economic minister and his team\u00a0resigned to protest government corruption. That same month, a \u201creform-minded deputy prosecutor resigned, complaining that his efforts to address government corruption had been consistently stymied by his own prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin,\u201d according to a Jan. 3, 2017, Congressional Research Service\u00a0report.", "\u201cAfter President Poroshenko complained that Shokin was taking too long to clean up corruption even within the [Prosecutor General\u2019s Office] itself, he asked for Shokin\u2019s resignation,\u201d the CRS report said. Shokin submitted his\u00a0resignation\u00a0in February 2016 and was\u00a0removed\u00a0a month later.", "It\u2019s important to note, too, that Trump is citing from unverified emails that were allegedly obtained in a bizarre way by his own lawyer. According to the Post, the emails were found on a laptop that had been abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store, and the shop owner turned it over to the FBI but before doing so he \u201cmade a copy of the hard drive and later gave it to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello.\u201d", "As we documented earlier this year, Giuliani has visited Ukraine and worked with current and former officials there in an attempt to obtain information damaging to Biden.", "More recently, we wrote that Giuliani had been working with Andriy Derkach, who has been identified by the U.S. intelligence community as a \u201cpro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian\u201d who is \u201cspreading claims about corruption \u2026 to undermine former Vice President Biden\u2019s candidacy and the Democratic Party.\u201d Those were the words of National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina, who issued an \u201celection threat update\u201d on Aug. 7 that said: \u201cRussia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden.\u201d", "This, of course, isn\u2019t the first time Trump is using material obtained from questionable sources against a Democratic opponent.", "As we wrote in 2016, then-candidate Trump used hacked materials released by WikiLeaks to repeatedly distort the facts about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the final days of the 2016 campaign. In that case, the Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, which is responsible for intelligence collection for the Russian military,\u00a0hacked into computer servers of the Democratic National Committee and party officials and released the hacked material to WikiLeaks and others \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances,\u201d the U.S. intelligence community said in 2017. A counterintelligence investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller resulted in multiple indictments against Russians and Russian companies.", "Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that the GRU successfully hacked Burisma\u2019s computers.", "\u201cThe timing of the Russian campaign mirrors the G.R.U. hacks we saw in 2016 against the D.N.C. and [Clinton campaign chairman] John Podesta,\u201d Oren Falkowitz, co-founder of Area 1, a security firm that discovered the hacking attempts, told the Times. \u201cOnce again, they are stealing email credentials, in what we can only assume is a repeat of Russian interference in the last election.\u201d", "We don\u2019t know at this point how Giuliani obtained emails and documents that purportedly belong to Hunter Biden.\u00a0But we do know that they don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s baseless accusations against Joe Biden.", "Updated, Oct. 16: We added a comment from Mike Carpenter, who was Biden\u2019s lead adviser for Ukraine.", "Editor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
