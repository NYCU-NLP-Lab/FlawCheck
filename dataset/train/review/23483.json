["In a\u00a0crucial election year, changes in voting procedures draw sharp scrutiny from all sides.", "A Facebook user in California posted a meme raising questions about\u00a0recent changes instituted by Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-led legislature\u00a0on the number and location of voting stations.", "The post:\u00a0\"So Newsom closed all voting precincts through California. In our county of ventura, 379 precincts will be closed voting day and instead only 47 'voting stations' will be open. newsom said this is because of CV19, but that makes no sense. If that were really his concern, you would want more locations with fewer people at each place, not less. Even more scary no one knows this is happening throughout all of California.\"", "The Facebook user, Bill Gentry, added his own observations: \"Beware of this happening right under your noses. CA Governor closing voting precincts only allowing few to remain open. They are afraid of the in person voter turnout and want to limit the ability of those wanting to vote in person. What they want is to ensure the fraudulent mail in votes to be counted over everything else.\"", "USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user for a response but did not get an immediate reply.", "More:Fact check: What's true and what's false about voting by mail in 2020", "The issue involves a new law, signed by Newsom in August,\u00a0that would allow counties to offer fewer in-person polling places in exchange for opening the sites several days earlier. This comes about five months after the governor\u00a0ordered election\u00a0officials in the state to send a vote-by-mail ballot to every active registered voter.", "In many ways, the new measure\u00a0builds on\u00a0the 2016 Voter's Choice Act\u00a0that\u00a0has allowed counties to send\u00a0every registered voter a ballot, expanded\u00a0in-person early voting and replaced\u00a0polling places with voting\u00a0centers.", "More:Fact check: 2018 empty mail-in ballot envelopes in California dumpster spur false fraud claims", "Newsom said he was taking the new\u00a0measures in response to the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic and its effect on in-person voting.", "He initially tried to implement the changes\u00a0through an executive order\u00a0in June, KQED reported, but that\u00a0raised some legal challenges regarding his authority. In response, the legislature passed the latest law, which he has signed.", "The law offers counties some options, but it does not mandate that they\u00a0adopt them.", "First, some terms:\u00a0Precincts are electoral districts\u00a0\u00a0and are not synonymous with polling places. It was not uncommon for several precincts in the past to vote at the same location.", "More:Fact check: Trump extends wildfire aid to California, offers help to Russia", "In Ventura County, which includes the cities of\u00a0Oxnard, Ventura, Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley,\u00a0voting in the March primary was conducted under the old rules. The\u00a0county, with a population of 850,000, chose not to adopt the Voter's Choice Act changes, saying they were\u00a0too restrictive, too expensive and officials did not think voters were ready to lose their polling places.", "That changed after the coronavirus pandemic hit.", "Looking toward November, Ventura County election officials said they expected challenges in finding enough locations or volunteers to work at the polls. In the past, many of those who volunteered were elderly and so at higher risk of severe illness from the coronavirus.", "\"I can tell you that counties need our help,\" Secretary of State Alex Padilla told reporters in August.\u00a0\"More than half the counties have communicated to my office that they need our assistance specifically in finding new voting locations.\"", "The new law allows\u00a0counties to merge precincts\u00a0for voting purposes as long as they keep the ratio of one voting place\u00a0per 10,000 registered voters instead of the typical 1,000 voters. These new, larger, consolidated polling places must be open for four days \u2014 from Oct. 31 through Nov. 3\u00a0\u2014 instead of just one, and for at least eight hours each day, and from 7 a.m.-8 p.m. on Election Day.", "Voters are not assigned a specific voting location but can cast ballots at any one of them.\u00a0In addition, counties are\u00a0required to open one ballot drop-off location for every 15,000 registered voters for 28 days before the election.", "State Sen. Tom Umberg, D-Santa Ana, said\u00a0he wrote the August bill \"to guarantee that there will be accessible, secure and safe in-person opportunities for voters who cannot or choose not to use their vote-by-mail ballot,\" KQED reported.", "He said that despite the\u00a0state's emphasis on mail voting, many voters will still need to vote in-person, including those who\u00a0need language or disability access assistance, or those who need to update their registration or address.", "In adopting the new measures, Ventura County reduced\u00a0the number of voting locations from\u00a0389\u00a0to 48,\u00a0while\u00a0expanding voting to four days instead of one, the Ventura County Star reports. The in-person voting locations include one at\u00a0the main elections office in Ventura, where early voting was set to begin Oct. 5; the other 47 places are open just ahead of Election Day.", "\"There will be no polling places, and I think that\u2019s the part that people are having a hard time with,\" said Miranda Nobriga, spokesperson for the county's election division. \"There are still voting locations, but they aren\u2019t the familiar traditional neighborhood polling places.\"", "Voters can also cast their ballot at any of the 48\u00a0locations, not just the one nearest their precinct.", "She notes that voting by mail is not\u00a0new in Ventura County, with more than 70% of the county\u2019s registered voters already voting\u00a0by mail. She says the county is encouraging people, during the pandemic, \"to stay home, stay safe and vote at home.\"", "In\u00a0addition to mailing ballots, voters can deliver them to 34 county drop boxes or vote in person.", "\u201cSo, we aren\u2019t asking the 485,000 registered voters to all go to these locations,\u201d she says.", "Nobriga says\u00a0that county elections officials mailed postcards to all registered voters on Aug. 21, urging them to\u00a0check their voter registration to make sure their mailing address was correct and provided details about some of the changes this year.", "We rate this claim as PARTLY FALSE. It is true that Ventura County officials have changed and reduced the number of\u00a0voting locations. Along with this, they increased the number of days for early voting and\u00a0set up locations to drop off ballots. That undercuts the claim that the governor was trying to reduce the turnout or\u00a0to limit the ability of those wanting to vote in person. It is also false to say no one is aware this is taking place; the election changes have been given wide coverage in the California news media and in Ventura County, each registered voter was sent a card outlining the new measures.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
