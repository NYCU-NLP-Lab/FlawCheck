Many of these rumors centered on Dominion Voting Systems, a company that provides election software to several counties around the United States.", "We have already debunked a number of these rumors (no, Dominion did not delete millions of votes; no, the company is not owned or funded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton; no, a \"glitch\" did not switch votes from Trump to Biden), but new wrinkles are continuously being added to this conspiracy theory.", "One recent rumor claimed that a member of Biden's transition team, Peter Neffenger, sat on the board of Dominion Voting Systems' \"subsidiary\" Smartmatic:", "There are a few kernels of truth to this claim.

In fact, Neffenger is only listed as a \"volunteer,\" as opposed to a \"detailee\" or a \"full-time transition employee,\" with the advisory team dealing with Homeland Security. Here is how Biden's \"Build Back Better\" website describes the purpose of agency review teams:", "Agency review teams are responsible for understanding the operations of each agency, ensuring a smooth transfer of power, and preparing for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris and their cabinet to hit the ground running on Day One. These teams are composed of highly experienced and talented professionals with deep backgrounds in crucial policy areas across the federal government.
