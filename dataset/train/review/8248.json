["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on March 25, 2020", "President Donald Trump recently said \u201cclose to 100 million people died\u201d from the 1918 Spanish flu, and that \u201cif you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying.\u201d But 100 million is a high-end estimate of global deaths from that influenza pandemic, and we found no evidence the case fatality rate for those who had it was 50%.", "Trump made those claims during a March 24 virtual town hall from the White House Rose Garden that aired on Fox News. He argued that the current coronavirus pandemic cannot be compared to the 1918 flu pandemic because of how deadly the latter was.", "Trump, March 24: You can\u2019t compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died. That was a flu, which \u2014 a little different. But that was a flu where if you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying.", "I think we\u2019re substantially under 1% because the people that get better are not reporting. So we only know people that go to doctors and go to hospitals, and we\u2019re taking that. And we\u2019re still a little bit above 1%. When you add all of the people \u2014 the millions of people that have it, that get better, we\u2019re substantially less than 1%.", "Trump has criticized the World Health Organization\u2019s March 3 estimate of a 3.4% global case fatality rate for individuals with COVID-19, the pneumonia-like disease caused by the new coronavirus. The president called it \u201ca false number\u201d because it was based on known cases and fatalities and does not account for unreported cases.", "It\u2019s not a false number, as we\u2019ve explained before, but the fatality rate for COVID-19 may end up being much lower \u2014 perhaps less than 1% \u2014 when more data about the total number of people who had it is available.", "Trump\u2019s claims about deaths from the so-called Spanish flu, however, are more suspect. To start, he relied on one of the highest estimates of fatalities; others are lower.", "In a 1991 report\u00a0published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, K. David Patterson and Gerald Pyle estimated that between 24.7 million and 39.3 million people died worldwide during that pandemic \u2014 but the authors wrote that \u201cwe believe that approximately 30 million is the best estimate for the terrible demographic toll of the influenza pandemic of 1918.\u201d", "The authors also noted that a much earlier, and much cited, estimate from 1927 put the death toll lower, at 21.6 million.", "Then in a 2002 report, also published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Niall Johnson and Juergen Mueller, referring to those earlier estimates, produced their own \u2014 50 million deaths, globally \u2014 which they said may have been an underestimate by as much as 100%. \u201cConsequently, the real pandemic mortality may fall in the range of 50 to 100 million,\u201d they wrote.", "It appears Trump was referring to that upper estimate.", "But more recently, in 2018, Peter Spreeuwenberg, Madelon Kroneman and John Paget did their own analysis \u2014 which was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology \u2014 and concluded that \u201c100 million deaths is highly unlikely.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe true estimate,\u201d the authors wrote, is \u201cprobably closer to our final estimate of 17.4 million deaths (1918 and 1919 combined).\u201d", "And even Johnson and Mueller, who estimated as many as 100 million deaths, said \u201cit would seem unlikely that a truly accurate figure can ever be calculated.\u201d", "What we also don\u2019t know for certain is how many people around the world contracted the Spanish flu.", "But if 500 million became infected, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, then those who contracted that influenza strain had a much lower chance of dying than Trump said, based on the previously discussed estimates of deaths.", "For instance, if 17.4 million of 500 million infected people died, then the global case fatality rate was about 3.5%. If there were 30 million deaths, then the rate would be 6%. And even if the number of deaths was 50 million or 100 million, then the rate would be between 10% and 20%.", "None of those equals a \u201c50/50\u201d chance of death, or a ratio \u201cvery close\u201d to it.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
