She\u2019s opposed by Republican state Del. Nick Freitas in Virginia\u2019s 7th District which, prior to Spanberger\u2019s election in 2018, had a long history of voting Republican.", "The National Republican Campaign Committee says Spanberger is lying in her ad and accepting backdoor corporate contributions. So we fact-checked Spanberger\u2019s claim that she\u2019s spurned corporate PAC contributions, and found it needs elaboration.", "According to her latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, Spanberger has raised $4.2 million in contributions since the start of 2019 through the end of June 2020. We found no money that came directly from corporations.", "But the NRCC has a small point. While Spanberger refuses direct corporate donations, she accepts contributions from PACs that do take corporate contributions. In other words, she receives a small amount of corporate PAC money that has been filtered.", "A corporate PAC is affiliated with a specific company that gathers donations from its employees and distributes it to politicians and political interest groups. Corporate funds cannot be contributed to the PAC.", "There are two main conduits that receive corporate PAC money and pass it on.", "One of the pipelines is formed by leadership PACs, which are set up by most members of Congress to help candidates from their party. For example, Spanberger has received a maximum $10,000 from the Forward Together PAC, associated with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. Forward Together has accepted contributions from a list of corporations, including Merck, Citigroup, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, General Electric and Altria. We counted 60 leadership PACs that have contributed to Spanberger\u2019s campaign.", "The second conduit is formed by ideological PACs, which are established by groups focusing on special causes, such as regulation, defense or health care.", "Spanberger has received $651,000 from PACs since the start of 2019. About $111,000 of that money filtered down from corporate PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics - a Washington nonprofit that tracks political money. The Center made its estimate by converting the percentage of money each Spanberger PAC donor received from corporations to a fraction of money it gave to her campaign.", "Perspective", "As we\u2019ve said, Spanberger has raised $4.2 million since 2019 began. The $111,000 that trickled in from corporations is 2.6% of all contributions to her campaign.", "Sixty members of Congress - including three Republicans - have promised not to accept corporate money, according to End Citizens United, a Washington nonprofit seeking to tighten campaign finance laws. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-2nd, is the only other Virginia congress member to make the pledge. Campaign finance advocates told us they\u2019re unaware of any incumbent who is declining both corporate and leadership PAC money.", "End Citizens United has endorsed Spanberger largely because of her no-corporate-money pledge and is not upset by her acceptance of leadership PAC money, according to Adam Bozzi, spokesman for the organization. Michael Beckel, research director for Issue One, another Washington non-profit seeking campaign finance reform, also told us Spanberger has been consistent.", "Bozzi and Beckel said direct contributions often give corporations access to politicians. They said office holders are far less likely to feel beholden to a corporation when its money has been filtered through a leadership PAC. \"If anything, the candidate may feel indebted to the politician whose leadership PAC contributed to his or her campaign,\" Beckel said.", "Spanberger \"has kept her promise to voters,\" Bozzi said.", "Sarah Bryner, research director for the Center for Responsive Politics, said it\u2019s become \"vogue\" for Democrats to decline corporate PAC money, but voters should be aware.", "\"Candidates trying to remove themselves are putting themselves in an awkward position because to completely shut themselves off from corporate donations right now is impossible,\" she said. \"...If you need money to run a political campaign, unless you\u2019re independently wealthy, you\u2019re getting money from people. And most people work for corporations.\"", "Bettina Weiss, Spanberger\u2019s campaign manager, said, \"Abigail does not take corporate PAC money.
