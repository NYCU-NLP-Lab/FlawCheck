A transgender man, for example, refers to a transgender individual who currently identifies as a man.", "Transsexual, according to the center, is an \"older term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth who seeks to transition from male to female or female to male. Many do not prefer this term because it is thought to sound overly clinical.\"", "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not attempt to count the number of Americans who identify themselves as transgender.", "An estimate made in 2011, by an expert in LGBT demography at UCLA Law School, put the figure at nearly 700,000, or 0.3 percent of the population.", "The laws", "We\u2019ll start our analysis by noting that we have rated True a claim by U.S. Rep.

Wisconsin statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation in three areas --\u00a0employment, housing and public accommodation -- do not expressly include transgender people.", "(According to Leech, Milwaukee and Madison include gender identity in ordinances that prohibit discrimination in all three areas. Milwaukee County and Dane County include gender identity in housing and employment discrimination ordinances; and Appleton includes gender identity in its fair housing ordinance.)", "2. That means that -- unlike gay men, for example, who have a right to file a complaint alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation -- it\u2019s unknown whether a Wisconsin state court would accept complaints from transgender people alleging discrimination based on their transgender status.", "3. Instead, a transgender person would have to persuade a judge that transgender people are covered either by state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex or on sexual orientation.", "4.
