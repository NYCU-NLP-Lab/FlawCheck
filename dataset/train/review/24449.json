Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., he praised her for being a reliable soldier for the Republican agenda.", "\"We need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half,\" Trump said.", "But on one key vote, Blackburn broke with many of her Republican colleagues, and the Tennessee Democrats are chiding her for it. Blackburn was one of 90 Republicans to vote against a sweeping $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that funded agencies across the government. Inside its many pages was a 2.4 percent pay hike for the military.", "In an email to the media May 30, party spokesman Mark Brown had the subject line \"Blackburn voted against military pay raise.\"", "The rest of the email was a copy and paste of an op-ed in the Tennessean from an Army veteran who criticized Blackburn for her vote.", "\"This is a congresswoman that constantly touts her support for the military and veterans, so her vote against something that would improve our quality of life is both puzzling and troubling,\" the veteran wrote.", "We decided to give Blackburn\u2019s voting record a closer look.", "Blackburn made no secret that she opposed the spending bill.", "At the time of the vote, she released a statement decrying its impact on deficits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the appropriations bill would put the country deeper in debt by many billions of dollars.", "\"Marsha has a record of supporting our military and veterans,\" campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler told us. \"Congressman Blackburn voted against the bloated spending package \u2014 that included a smaller military pay raise than the one she supported (2.6 percent) \u2014 because of its reckless spending.\"", "As with any all-encompassing legislation, lawmakers will find some elements they support and others they oppose. Whichever way they vote, it is difficult to tie their decision to a specific section.", "In her 15 years in Congress, Blackburn has voted for appropriations bills that increased military pay at least four times, in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. The military pay hikes in those appropriations bills ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.5 percent.", "There are a number of authorization bills with pay increases that Blackburn has also supported. We counted 14 over the years, including the most recent one that passed in November 2017 with a 2.4 percent pay hike.", "Authorization bills don\u2019t carry the same weight as appropriations measures, because they don\u2019t actually give agencies the green light to spend money.", "Despite her opposition to the latest spending bill, Blackburn welcomed Trump\u2019s support, and several of the victories he described at the rally, such as hikes in military spending, came out of the appropriations bill she voted against. And when the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel took to Twitter to praise Trump for the military pay raises, Blackburn\u2019s campaign retweeted the message.", "The Tennessee Democratic Party said that Blackburn voted against a military pay increase. Blackburn did vote no on a $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that increased pay for members of the armed forces by 2.4 percent.", "However, over many years, Blackburn has a consistent track record of voting in favor of pay raises for the military. To tie her recent vote to a single part of a massive spending measure leaves out a great deal of context. In this case, the legislation was estimated to add billions to annual deficits.", "We rate this claim Half True.", "Tennessee Democratic Party, ICYMI email, May 31, 2018", "Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028, April 2018", "Congressional Budget Office, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, March 22, 2018", "Marsha Blackburn, Blackburn Issues Statement on the $1.3 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill, March 22, 2018", "Tennessean, Blackburn Said She Supports Military Raises, But She Voted Against Them, May 30, 2018", "Marsha Blackburn, tweet, Feb. 6, 2018", "U.S. Congress, H.R.5515 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, May 24, 2018", "U.S. Congress, Military Pay Protection Act of 2017, May 23, 2018", "U.S. Congress, Blackburn appropriation votes, see links in the fact-check", "Email interview, Abbi Sigler, spokeswoman, Blackburn for Senate, June 1, 2018", "Email interview, Mark Brown, spokesman, Tennessee Democratic Party, May 31, 2018", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
