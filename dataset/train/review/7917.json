["About this rating", "On 30 April 2016, the web site\u00a0Departed.co\u00a0published a clickbait article claiming that American flags were removed from a Pearl Harbor memorial at President Obama's request. \u00a0The piece had no context beyond\u00a0a series of photographs of what they said was the flag being taken down.", "While Departed.co\u00a0published several photographs of the memorial \u2014 some of which included a flagpole, while\u00a0others were taken after the flagpole was\u00a0removed \u2014 \u00a0they provided little information about the memorial or the flag's removal. No photographs showed any proof, even by inference, that President Obama was either present or responsible for the order:", "As it turns out, there's also a good reason that President Obama was not shown in any photographs: this didn't even\u00a0take place\u00a0during Barack Obama's presidential term.\u00a0The images were first posted in 2007 by the web site\u00a0CapVeterans.com.", "A couple of years previously, the Honolulu Advertiser\u00a0had reported that Pearl Harbor was undergoing major renovations and that some veterans were worried about potential changes:", "The memorial's visitor center is overburdened \u2014 the lines to bathrooms there are the stuff of legend \u2014 and the National Park Service would like to expand its facilities.", "(Hawai'i entrepreneur Patrick) Brent said he transformed \"a filthy parking lot with broken glass and a high crime rate\" into a respite for visitors. \"Every time we put out a chair, someone sits down,\" Brent said.", "But aging survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor have frequently complained to Brent about his for-profit organization. One veteran told him that the sailors entombed in the USS Arizona are crying because he is selling cola, Brent said. \"They attack us because of the respect thing.\u00a0There is no one in this neighborhood more respectful than myself and my people.\"", "We have reached out to the National Park Service for details about this incident, but it's clear that the flagpole's removal had more to do with renovations than politics. \u00a0Regardless of why it was removed, the flagpole was not taken down on the orders of President Barack Obama.", "CapVeterans.com. \u00a0 \"The National Park Service Wants To Remove The Marine Corps PEARL HARBOR Remembrance Memorial.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2007.", "Gordon, Mike. \u00a0 \"Navy's $84M development deal is changing the face of Pearl Harbor.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Honolulu Advertiser. \u00a0 21 February 2005.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
