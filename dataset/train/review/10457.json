There\u2019s no evidence Wolf was scheduled to do a special for Hulu.", "The controversy surrounding comedian Michelle Wolf\u2019s remarks at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner on April 28 has spawned several false stories.", "We recently wrote about one that wrongly claimed she had been fired from Comedy Central.", "A similar story, claiming that Hulu cancelled a comedy special starring Wolf, has also been circulating on Facebook. Users of the social media site were right to flag that one as potentially false, too. It\u2019s not true.", "Like the story that claimed Comedy Central fired Wolf, the story about Hulu originated on a website called Daily World Update, which describes its content as satire. But the story has been copied by at least one other site that doesn\u2019t have a disclaimer and presents it as news.", "Not only is the story made-up, some of the people named in it are made-up, as well. The story quotes \u201cHulu President Irwin R. Fletcher,\u201d but Hulu doesn\u2019t have a president. It has a CEO whose name is Randy Freer, and Irwin Fletcher is the name of the title character in the 1985 movie, \u201cFletch.\u201d", "The made-up story claims, \u201cWolf has been defending her disgusting remarks, but has not yet commented on the cancellation of the show she has spent so much time promoting.\u201d", "But there\u2019s no evidence that Wolf had plans to do a comedy special on Hulu, which she did not promote on her website or on Twitter. Her HBO special aired in December, and her weekly Netflix series debuts May 27.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "C-Span. \u201cMichelle Wolf COMPLETE REMARKS at 2018 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\u201d YouTube. 28 Apr 2018.", "\u201cBREAKING: Hulu Cancels Michelle Wolf\u2019s Standup Special After Disgustisting Attacks.\u201d DailyWorldUpdate.us. 29 Apr 2018.", "\u201cMichelle Wolf: Nice Lady.\u201d HBO.com.\u00a0 Accessed 2 May 2018.", "Netflix. \u201cThe Break with Michelle Wolf Comes to Netflix on May 27.\u201d 11 Apr 2018.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
