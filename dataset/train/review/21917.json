["\u201cAOC Wasn\u2019t Even in the Capitol Building During Her \u2018Near Death\u2019 Experience,\u201d the headline on a February 3, 2021 article from conservative news site RedState said.", "\u201cIf she was in her office, she was in the Cannon Building which is nearby, but a different building. But of course, many didn\u2019t get the logistics and just assumed that she was in the Capitol building,\u201d RedState wrote.", "RedState\u2019s article was cited by others including Trending Politics which said she had been called out over a \u201cmassive hoax,\u201d as well as on Twitter, and in a Facebook post by author and filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza. In a February 5 Facebook video, D\u2019Souza further addressed the congresswoman\u2019s purportedly \u201cfake account.\u201d", "Ocasio-Cortez has been a regular target of criticism from Republicans and former president Donald Trump.", "She posted her nearly 90-minute Instagram live video on February 2, beginning with a revelation that she was a sexual assault survivor. \u201cTrauma compounds on each other,\u201d she said.", "Almost a month earlier, hundreds of Trump supporters had invaded the domed Capitol, where legislators were meeting to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory, in a riot fueled by false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election.", "The unrest led to the deaths of\u00a0five people and prompted\u00a0the House of Representatives to impeach Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection. His Senate trial began February 9.", "Although her video is titled \u201cWhat Happened at the Capitol,\u201d she never claims in the clip to have been at the legislative building itself during the January 6 violence.", "\u201cMembers of Congress, except for the Speaker and other very, very high ranking ones, don't actually work in that building with the dome. There's buildings right next to the dome and that's where our actual offices are,\u201d she said in the video.", "Hers is in the Cannon House Office Building southeast of the Capitol, which Google Maps shows as being roughly 200 yards away.", "Ocasio-Cortez said there was a moment on January 6 when she \u201cthought everything was over\u201d and that she was going to die after an unidentified man repeatedly banged on the door of her office, prompting her to hide in a bathroom while he yelled, \u201cWhere is she? Where is she?\u201d", "When her staffer said it was OK to come out, she saw it was a Capitol Police officer, who told them to go to another building but did not accompany them.", "She fled to the Longworth House Office Building, which is connected by a tunnel network and was under a shelter-in-place order.", "Her office did not respond to an emailed query for elaboration, and Capitol Police did not respond to a question about the situation at Cannon and Longworth offices on that day.", "Ocasio-Cortez said she and her staffer eventually ran into Representative Katie Porter, who\u00a0let them hide in her office in Longworth.", "Even those on the periphery of potentially traumatic events can experience emotional distress.", "\u201cWe know that there are acute reactions and stress that are nearly universal,\u201d\u00a0 said Farris Tuma, chief of the Traumatic Stress Research Program at the National Institute of Mental Health, who was speaking generally and did not discuss what happened to Ocasio-Cortez.", "\u201cNot everybody experiences the same thing the same way,\u201d however, Tuma said.", "So it is likely that not only those at the epicenter of an event, but \u201cpeople close to what happened in one way or another, either physically close or because of a relationship and a connection they have with someone,\u201d would experience distress, anxiety and worry, he said.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
