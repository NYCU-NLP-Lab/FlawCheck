The tweet included the following images, and was sent out at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on April 19, 2017:", "Patriots' turnout for President Obama in 2015 vs. Patriots' turnout for President Trump today: https://t.co/OxMEOqZonI pic.twitter.com/pLmJWhOw1j", "The top image is the team\u2019s trip to the White House on April 23, 2015, to celebrate the Patriots\u2019 victory in Super Bowl XLIX. The bottom image is their April 19 visit for their come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI. The post was retweeted almost\u00a049,000 times.", "The photos appear to show that a mere fraction of the team showed up to visit Trump, compared to the sprawling entourage that visited Obama. The comparison recalled the January 2017 dispute over images showing smaller crowds for Trump\u2019s inauguration than for Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in.", "But while several players were absent from the 2017 visit, it\u2019s difficult to fairly compare the two photographs. The 2015 photo showed the team and its administrative staff, while the 2017 photo did not.", "The Patriots pointed this out at 8:45 p.m. the same day, noting that more than 40 staff members were seated instead of lining the staircases, forcing the New York Times to backpeddle a bit.", "These photos lack context. Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs. In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn. https://t.co/iIYtV0hR6Y", "Why no photo with the entire staff this year? \"That\u2019s just what the White House chose to do,\" team spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Globe.

So has quarterback Tom Brady, who had announced in a statement before the gathering that he would be absent because of \"personal family matters.\" Brady also skipped the 2015 ceremony.", "NESN Patriots reporter Doug Kyed tweeted out a list of players who did not attend the ceremony before the New York Times story published.", "We attempted to contact both the New York Times and the Patriots via phone and email, but neither responded with any comment beyond prior public statements.", "Another element to the attendance appears to be that, well, it\u2019s just not all that special for a team that\u2019s won five Super Bowls since 2002 to visit the White House.", "The New York Times story provided figures from James, who said 45 players went to the White House in 2002, when Bush was president, closer to 2015\u2019s 50 players. But in 2004 and 2005, the players numbered closer to this week\u2019s 34 player attendees.
