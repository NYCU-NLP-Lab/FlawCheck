["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on October 25, 2020 | Updated on September 1, 2022", "Social media posts, including one retweeted by Donald Trump Jr., falsely claim that a yearbook photo shows Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly dressed as Hitler for Halloween. Kelly\u2019s campaign and several of his former classmates told FactCheck.org that the photo is not of Kelly.", "Drawing on a report from a conservative news site, several social media posts claim \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that Mark Kelly, a Democrat running for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, was photographed in an Adolf Hitler costume at a 1985 Halloween party at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.", "\u201cBreaking: Yearbook Photo emerges of AZ (D) Senate candidate Mark Kelly dressed as Adolf Hitler!\u201d reads one Facebook post that racked up more than 2,600 shares in less than a day.", "Another post, by the group \u201cPresident Trump Fans,\u201d includes images of a tweet by the reporter who originated the story on Oct 23.", "The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., also retweeted the story the day it was published in National File, a conservative web outlet founded in 2019 that has previously trafficked  in misinformation, as we\u2019ve reported.", "\u201cTrump is literally Hitler\u201d", "Nope, but apparently Mark Kelly is! https://t.co/zuP24UxWI2", "\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 23, 2020", "The allegation about Kelly is baseless.", "There is no identifying information linking Kelly to the photo, and numerous classmates told FactCheck.org that it wasn\u2019t him. Representatives for Kelly, who is perhaps best known as a former NASA astronaut and husband to former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, also denied that he is in the photo.", "\u201cThe website that published this has been unable to provide any evidence or verification of their original claim \u2014 and that\u2019s because it is not true,\u201d\u00a0said Kelly\u2019s communications director Jacob Peters in an email.", "National File states in its report that it \u201chas obtained yearbook photos that show Mark Kelly dressed as Hitler for Halloween,\u201d but provides no evidence to support that claim. The photos in question are black and white and show a young white man in aviator sunglasses with a mustache and a swastika armband.", "The article does not include any sources who say the person in the Hitler costume is Kelly. One piece of circumstantial evidence, the story suggests, is that Kelly is photographed wearing similar sunglasses on his yearbook\u2019s senior page.", "We found the photos National File purportedly unearthed online in a publicly available scanned copy of the 1986 yearbook. Photos of a costumed Hitler appear on two pages, neither of which are captioned to provide identifying information.", "Shortly after publication of the allegation, the Kelly campaign issued a statement saying that Kelly was not in the Hitler photos and \u201che never dressed up in such a costume.\u201d", "\u201cThe story is false and should be retracted immediately, and those who have spread this misinformation online should delete it,\u201d said campaign manager Jen Cox. \u201cAnyone using it to try to smear a combat veteran should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d", "The campaign also relayed statements from five classmates who said the person dressed as Hitler was not Kelly. The Arizona Republic also wrote a story detailing Kelly\u2019s denial and that of four classmates.", "National File then published a second story claiming that Kelly\u2019s classmates went \u201cdark\u201d after their Friday statements, suggesting that those statements might have been fabricated by the campaign, since it was unclear if the Arizona Republic reporter had spoken directly with those individuals.", "FactCheck.org can confirm that Kelly\u2019s classmates did not go \u201cdark,\u201d as we subsequently spoke by phone to two classmates who gave statements to the campaign.", "Ed McDonald verified that he was a classmate of Kelly\u2019s, had attended the Halloween mixer, and that Kelly was not dressed as a Nazi. He added that the people in the photo were from Second Company \u2014 a different company from Kelly\u2019s.", "McDonald said he first heard about the allegation from fellow classmate Jennifer Boykin, and that when he went to consult his yearbook, he \u201cimmediately\u201d knew that the costumed Hitler was not Kelly.", "Peter Lindsey, another classmate who provided a statement to the campaign, also confirmed similar details in a phone call with FactCheck.org, saying that he and his classmates were in \u201cincredulous shock that this even came up.\u201d", "Noting that he is a Republican and that he contacted the Kelly campaign \u2014 not the other way around \u2014 Lindsey said Kelly was not in the Halloween photos, and that since Kelly was as a regimental officer who was in charge of the plebes, or freshmen, the concept that Kelly would dress as Hitler was preposterous.", "It\u2019s \u201cinconceivable\u201d that someone in Kelly\u2019s position would have worn a Nazi costume two months into the school year, he said, noting that Kelly \u201cwasn\u2019t the kind of guy to do that\u201d anyway.", "Lindsey further said that he had been contacted by someone on LinkedIn about six weeks ago who asked him if Kelly was in a particular photo. The photo was similar to one of the Halloween photos in the yearbook, but did not obviously show that the person was dressed as Hitler and did not show a swastika.", "In screenshots of the exchange that were shared with FactCheck.org, Lindsey replied that the photo was grainy, but that the person did not look like Kelly \u2014 and that the other people he recognized in the photo were from a different \u201cbattalion / company,\u201d so he \u201chighly doubt[ed]\u201d that it was Kelly.", "The LinkedIn request came from Karim Addetia, who claimed to be a research and communications intern at the Center for Responsible Enterprise and Trade.", "The Kelly campaign has identified Addetia as a consultant with the Senate Leadership Fund, a super political action committee dedicated to expanding the Republican Senate majority.\u00a0According to Federal Election Commission\u00a0filings, the super PAC has paid Addetia nearly $29,000 this year and the group has\u00a0spent\u00a0more than $31 million in an effort to defeat Kelly in his race against Republican Sen. Martha McSally. (In addition to reporting more than $17 million in independent expenditures against Kelly, the Senate Leadership Fund contributed $13.8 million to a separate super PAC, DefendArizona, which has spent $15.5 million to defeat Kelly.)", "Three additional classmates also told us Kelly was not in the Halloween photos. We independently reached out to the two contacts listed on the Merchant Marine Academy\u2019s alumni website, and both 1986 class representatives told us by email that Kelly was not in the Hitler photos.", "\u201cIt is absolutely not Mark Kelly,\u201d said Geoff Pletcher.", "\u201cI was at the Halloween party in 1985, in fact \u2013 I am one of the \u2018jail birds\u2019 in the bottom left photo,\u201d said Connie Dato English. \u201cThe person in question in the middle photo is not Mark Kelly, nor a public figure. I can say unequivocally that Mark Kelly is not pictured on that page at all.\u201d", "Joe Martino, the 1986 class president, also said in a phone call that the Hitler figure was not Kelly. He added that he had heard from at least five other classmates who said the same.", "Martino, too, noted that the people he recognized in the photo were from Second Company \u2014 and said that given that Kelly was second in command of his regiment, it was hard to imagine him even attending the party.", "\u201cFor him to even be at this party, in costume of any kind,\u201d he said, is \u201chard to figure.\u201d", "Clarification, Oct. 26: We updated this story to provide additional details on how the Senate Leadership Fund has spent more than $31 million to date in its effort to defeat Kelly.", "Update, Oct. 29: Kelly filed a libel lawsuit against National File\u2019s operator, Flyover Media,\u00a0on Oct. 26, Pima County Superior Court\u00a0records\u00a0show. The suit\u00a0argues\u00a0that the outlet knew when it published its story that Kelly was not dressed as Hitler.", "A day after the suit was filed, National File\u00a0updated\u00a0its story to include denials from Kelly\u2019s classmates and the campaign, but claimed it was unable to contact the classmates to \u201cindependently confirm their accounts,\u201d and said it had spoken to an unnamed classmate who \u201crefused to deny\u201d that Kelly was dressed as Hitler. FactCheck.org did confirm several of those denials and also identified new sources who corroborated that Kelly was not in the Halloween photos.", "Update, Sept. 1, 2022: Attorneys for Kelly and Flyover Media jointly moved to dismiss the libel suit in a court filing on July 16, 2021, and Arizona Superior Court Judge D. Douglas Metcalf issued an order granting the \u201cStipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice\u201d on July 19, 2021. Under the agreement, each party would pay their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and Kelly could not refile the libel suit against Flyover Media. The resolution of the case came about two months after the court denied Flyover Media\u2019s motion to dismiss Kelly\u2019s suit on May 21, 2021.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
