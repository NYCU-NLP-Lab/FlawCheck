["By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore and Lori Robertson", "Posted on January 6, 2021 | Updated on August 1, 2023", "Prior to the violence that disrupted Congress\u2019 counting of the electoral votes, President Donald Trump gave an indignant speech filled with falsehoods about the presidential election he lost two months ago to Democrat Joe Biden.", "\u201cNow it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy,\u201d Trump told his supporters at a \u201cSave America\u201d rally. \u201cAfter this, we\u2019re going to walk down [to the Capitol]\u00a0and I\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d", "Trump wasn\u2019t there with them. But that was the least of his false statements on a day when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and halted the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes in a joint session of the House and Senate.", "The president made numerous false claims of election fraud in several swing states that decided the Nov. 3 election:", "Several times at the rally and twice\u00a0on Twitter on Jan. 6, Trump claimed that Pence, who has a ministerial role in the official congressional counting of the electoral votes, could \u201csend it back to the states to recertify, and we become president.\u201d Trump told his supporters: \u201cHe has the absolute right to do it.\u201d", "Pence, who serves as president of the Senate, said he does not have the right to do it.", "While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress directly contradicting Trump\u2019s claim that somehow Pence could do \u201cthe right thing\u201d and \u201cwe win the election.\u201d", "Pence wrote: \u201cIt is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.\u201d", "The Constitution stipulates that after state electors have certified and sent their sealed votes for president and vice president to the president of the Senate, he \u201cshall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.\u201d", "That process was supposed to play out on Jan. 6, as stipulated by U.S. law, but was derailed by violent protesters who stormed the U.S. Capitol.", "\u201cSome believe that as Vice President, I should be able to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally,\u201d Pence wrote. \u201cOthers believe that electoral votes should never be challenged in a Joint Session of Congress. After a careful study of our Constitution, our laws, and our history, I believe neither view is correct.\u201d", "Trump, for one, believed that Pence could reject electoral votes, as he said in a Jan. 5 tweet. \u201cThe Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,\u201d Trump claimed.", "Pence went on to say: \u201cOur Founders were deeply skeptical of concentrations of power and created a Republic based on separation of powers and checks and balances under the Constitution of the United States. Vesting the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide presidential contests would be entirely antithetical to that design.\u201d", "Garrett Epps, professor of law emeritus at the University of Baltimore School of Law, told us he didn\u2019t know of \u201cany text anywhere\u201d upon which Trump could base this claim of Pence being able to change or reject the electoral votes. \u201cThis just has been made up out of whole cloth,\u201d he said.", "The Constitution doesn\u2019t say the vice president shall count the votes, Epps said. \u201cIt says the votes shall be counted.\u201d And the Electoral Count Act says that counting is done by tellers in Congress.", "The Electoral Count Act, which was signed into law in 1887, says that the Senate and House each shall appoint two tellers to count the votes. The president of the Senate (the vice president) is supposed to hand the tellers the state certifications after he opens them, and the tellers are then to read those documents and make a list of the votes. Once all the votes are counted in that manner, the result is given to the president of the Senate, who announces the result.", "There is a process under that law for objections by members of Congress \u2014 which Pence referred to in his letter. But that procedure \u201cis lodged in the two Houses, not in the VP,\u201d Epps said.", "That procedure, which began to play out on Jan. 6 with the announcement of Arizona\u2019s certified electoral votes in a joint session of Congress, requires any objection to be made in writing, signed by one senator and one representative at least, as a Congressional Research Service report explains.", "Such an objection would then \u201ctrigger a debate in each chamber and a majority vote in each chamber as to whether or not to sustain the objection to the counting of any particular state\u2019s electoral ballots,\u201d Keith E. Whittington, a politics professor at Princeton University, wrote for the Lawfare blog on Jan. 5. \u201cIf even one chamber votes to overrule the objection\u2014as the Democratic-controlled House will undoubtedly do\u2014then the count will continue. The recognition of Biden\u2019s electoral victory will be delayed, but it is inevitable.\u201d", "Pence explained his limited role in this process by quoting Supreme Court Justice Joseph Bradley, who after the 1876 election wrote that \u201cthe powers of the President of the Senate are merely ministerial. \u2026 [I]f any examination at all is to be gone into, or any judgment exercised in relation to the votes received, it must be performed and exercised by the two Houses.\u201d", "Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s attorney during the impeachment trial, also said on his radio show on Jan. 5 that Pence didn\u2019t have the power to reject some electoral votes. \u201cSome have speculated that the vice president could simply say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to accept these electors,\u2019 that he has the authority to do that under the Constitution,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the Constitution has in mind. If that were the case, any vice president could refuse any election.\u201d", "Trump falsely claimed that in Pennsylvania there were \u201c205,000 more ballots then you had voters.\u201d That figure comes from a flawed partisan analysis that was \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the Pennsylvania Department of State.", "Trump, Jan. 6:\u00a0There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Now think of this. You had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. \u2026 Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody\u2019s imagination.", "The president first made this claim in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0on Dec. 28 \u2014 the same day a group of Republican legislators in Pennsylvania issued a\u00a0press release\u00a0that said there were \u201c202,377 more votes cast than voters voting,\u201d citing an \u201cextensive analysis\u201d of state and county election data.", "\u201cA comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted,\u201d the press release said, explaining how it arrived at the 202,377 figure.", "But the Pennsylvania Department of State\u00a0called\u00a0the allegations \u201cfalse and misleading,\u201d because the analysis was \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data\u201d from \u201cvery different systems and data points with different timeframes.\u201d", "The data contained in the Department of State\u2019s Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors, or SURE, system were incomplete at the time of the GOP analysis because some counties had \u201cnot yet finished entering into the SURE system what are called voter histories,\u201d the department said in a Dec. 29 statement.", "\u201cEach history is tied to the record of the individual voter who cast a ballot, including regular or provisional ballots,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt the time of the legislators\u2019 release, these counties included Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, which would account for a significant number of voters, and other provisional voter histories in a number of other counties are also not yet complete.\u201d", "In a series of tweets, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf urged the\u00a0Pennsylvania congressional delegation\u00a0and\u00a0Trump\u00a0to drop their baseless claims of fraud and accept Pennsylvania\u2019s Electoral College votes for Biden.", "\u201cPennsylvania had a free, fair, and secure election,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThere was no fraud or illegal activity.\u201d", "The president falsely claimed that \u201cmore than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day.\u201d", "But those 10,000 votes have not been counted, contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, and they would not change the outcome even if they were counted.", "Trump is referring to about 10,000 ballots that were postmarked by Election Day on Nov. 3, but were received between 8 p.m. on Nov. 3 and 5 p.m. on Nov. 6. The Trump campaign sought to block Pennsylvania from counting those late-arriving ballots in a case that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "On Oct. 28, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\u00a0ordered\u00a0county election officials to comply with a Pennsylvania Department of State\u00a0directive\u00a0to keep those late-arriving ballots segregated from the rest of the ballots, pending the high court\u2019s review of the case.", "There were 10,097 late-arriving ballots, but they were not counted, according to a Dec. 20\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0story.", "\u201cSCOTUS ordered counties to strictly segregate these ballots, and it was determined that they would be most clearly segregated by not adding them to the totals until further action by the court,\u201d Department of State spokesperson Wanda Murren told the\u00a0Inquirer.", "Biden won Pennsylvania by more than\u00a080,000 votes.", "Trump reprised a familiar false claim about \u201cthousands\u201d of dead people voting in Pennsylvania.", "Trump, Jan. 6:\u00a0Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people! Lots of dead people, thousands.", "Previously, the president claimed that as many as\u00a020,000\u00a0\u201cdead people\u201d voted in Pennsylvania. Now, he is saying \u201cthousands,\u201d possibly 8,000. He\u2019s still wrong.", "As of Dec. 20, there has been\u00a0only one verified case\u00a0of a vote being cast in the name of a deceased person, according to Newsweek. The man arrested was a Trump supporter, Bruce Bartman, who admitted that he cast a ballot in his dead mother\u2019s name. In October, Robert Lynn, a registered Republican, was\u00a0charged\u00a0with applying for a ballot application in his dead mother\u2019s name, but no vote was cast in that case.", "In another case cited by Trump supporters, Denise Ondick of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, died on Oct. 22, but election officials received her application for a mail-in ballot on Oct. 23, according to online records from the Pennsylvania Department of State. Those records also show that her ballot was then received back by the county on Nov. 2, and that her vote was recorded.", "Trump also raised the bogus issue of thousands of alleged votes from \u201cdead\u201d people in Georgia. According to Trump, \u201cOver 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election.\u201d", "When Trump raised the issue in a Jan. 2 phone call with Georgia\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \u2014 during which Trump pressured him to recalculate the state\u2019s vote in his favor \u2014 Raffensperger told the president his data was wrong.", "\u201cThe actual number were two, two,\u201d Raffensperger told Trump. \u201cTwo people that were dead that voted and so that\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "As we have written, claims of dead people voting are common, and often overblown. Most often, claims about large numbers of votes from deceased people turn out to be due to list-matching or clerical problems, such as confusing two people with identical or similar names, Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who specializes in elections, told us via email back in November.", "As we have\u00a0written before, votes cast illegally in the name of a dead person are\u00a0exceedingly rare. Such few illegal votes would not affect the outcome in a state that Biden won by more than\u00a080,000 votes (Pennsylvania) or more than 11,000 (Georgia).", "As he has in the past, Trump wrongly claimed that Georgia Republicans and \u201cDemocrat party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s address this disinformation about signature match,\u201d Raffensperger wrote on Facebook on Nov. 15. \u201cWe strengthened signature match. We helped train election officials on [Georgia Bureau of Investigation] signature match \u2014 which is confirmed twice before a ballot is ever cast.\u201d", "Georgia election officials check signatures when a voter requests a mail-in ballot, and then again when the ballot is returned.", "According to a state law passed last year, election officials must \u201cpromptly notify\u201d voters about a ballot rejection due to an issue with the signature, allowing them to \u201ccure\u201d their ballot by casting a provisional ballot \u2014 along with supplying identification information \u2014 within three days of the polls closing on Election Day.", "As for the consent decree Trump mentioned, that refers to a settlement agreement in federal court reached in March that was crafted by Raffensperger to settle a lawsuit brought by Democrats over absentee ballots rejected in the 2018 general election. According to the consent decree, voters must be contacted the next business day \u2014 by phone or email \u2014 if their absentee ballot is rejected due to a signature issue.", "\u201cThe State of Georgia entered a consent decree that essentially did one thing and one thing only \u2026 instead of giving three days to inform a voter there was an issue with their ballot, [it] is down to 24 hours when you\u2019re within 11 days of the election,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, the state\u2019s voting system implementation manager, said in his Nov. 17 press conference. \u201cThat is the one and only thing that that consent order addressed in any real way.\u201d", "Raffensperger contends that agreement had little impact on the presidential election.", "\u201cTakeaway is that rejection rate from 2018 to 2020 is exact same even after ballots with signature [issues] were cured,\u201d Raffensperger wrote on Facebook on Nov. 16. \u201cSo, the idea that some settlement agreement that we entered into changed how counties were doing this is basically nonsense.\u201d", "Trump falsely claimed that \u201cGeorgia\u2019s absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels\u201d and that \u201cif Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots, as in other years\u201d he would have won the state.", "As he has in the past, Trump is comparing the rate of ballots rejected for signature issues in this election to the number of ballots rejected in past elections for all reasons, usually for being received too late.", "Georgia hasn\u2019t released data on the total number of mail-in ballots rejected; it has only released the number of mail-in ballots rejected because of signature issues (missing or mismatched signatures). And it is about the same percentage as in the 2018 midterm and only slightly lower than in the 2016 presidential election.", "When considered as a percentage of mail-in ballots cast, the rejection rate for signature issues was nearly identical in 2020 (0.15%) to what it was in 2018 (0.16%), according to figures from the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office.", "In a Nov. 17 press conference, Sterling said the rejection percentage for signature issues was about the same in the 2016 election as well \u2014 with about 580 ballots with missing or mismatched signatures out of 246,000 mail-in ballots cast that year. That comes to a rejection rate of about 0.24%.", "\u201cSo this is pretty consistent on this,\u201d said Sterling, a Republican.", "According to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a total of about 3.1% mail-in ballots were rejected in Georgia in 2018 (see Table 2), and about 6.4% were rejected in 2016 (see Table 2). Most ballots are rejected because they arrive late, and rejections for signature issues are just a fraction of the overall rejection totals.", "Trump falsely claimed that Republican poll watchers in Fulton County were told to leave \u201cunder the false pretense of a pipe burst \u2026 which we now know was a total lie. Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours totally unsupervised.\u201d", "As the\u00a0Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u00a0reported on Nov. 3, a water leak at\u00a0State Farm Arena\u00a0in Atlanta, which served as a ballot processing site, caused a several hours delay in vote-counting on Election Day. The leak occurred at 6:07 a.m.,\u00a0according\u00a0to the arena, and it was fixed within two hours.", "Later that night, election workers thought they\u2019d be knocking off for the night, and began putting uncounted ballots in storage boxes with numbered seals, per policy, Sterling explained in a Jan. 4 press conference. At that point, poll watchers left, though no one told them to, Frances Watson, chief investigator for the Georgia secretary of state, later said. Affidavits\u00a0from\u00a0two Republican field organizers who were in the room did not claim they were instructed or forced to leave because of the leak, as Trump said; they instead said they were under the impression counting had ceased.", "But Raffensperger directed election officials to continue working through the night.", "As for the \u201csuitcases\u201d of \u201cfraudulent\u201d ballots pulled from under a table, the secretary of state\u2019s office publicly posted video of the entire thing. According to Sterling, it shows nothing more than the legitimate counting of votes that had been boxed up only an hour before.", "\u201cAnd this is what is really frustrating: The president\u2019s legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and then, from our point of view, intentionally misled the state Senate, voters, and the people of the United States about this,\u201d Sterling said on Jan. 4. \u201cIt was intentional, it was obvious, and anybody watching this knows that.\u201d", "Update, Aug. 1, 2023: On June 20, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office\u00a0released\u00a0an investigative report concluding that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of any fraud regarding the claim that \u201csuitcases\u201d of illegal ballots were counted on election night. Investigators from the FBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the secretary of state\u2019s office interviewed Fulton County election workers and reviewed \u201cthe entire unedited security video footage of the events in question\u201d in response to a complaint referred by a state senator and specifically naming two election night workers in the video, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss.", "\u201cThere was no evidence of any type of fraud as alleged. \u2026 All allegations made against Freeman and Moss were unsubstantiated and found to have no merit,\u201d the report, dated March 7,\u00a0concluded.", "In congressional testimony, the two women\u00a0described\u00a0how they had been harassed and received death threats after members of the Trump campaign and others pushed false claims that they had engaged in voter fraud. Freeman and Moss\u00a0filed\u00a0a defamation suit against One America News Network and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "OANN\u00a0settled\u00a0the suit in May. A July 25 court filing by Giuliani\u00a0said\u00a0he \u201cdoes not contest\u201d that statements he made about the women were false, but he argues the statements were \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d speech. A political adviser to Giuliani\u00a0told\u00a0news organizations\u00a0that Giuliani \u201cdid not acknowledge that the statements were false but did not contest it in order to move on to the portion of the case that will permit a motion to dismiss.\u201d", "Trump falsely claimed that \u201c66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.\u201d", "\u201cThe actual number is zero,\u201d Sterling explained at a press conference on Jan. 4. \u201cAnd the reason we know that is because the dates are on the voter registration. There are four cases, four, where people requested their absentee ballot before they turned 18 but they turned 18 by the Election Day. That means that is a legally cast ballot.\u201d", "In a tweet sent just hours before his speech, Trump wrongly claimed Georgia \u201cjust happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night\u201d in the Georgia Senate run-off election, but Sterling said they were just routine absentee ballots being counted as a matter of course.", "Trump claimed the ballots were evidence that \u201cOur Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!\u201d", "They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2021", "Less than an hour after Trump posted his tweet, Sterling responded on Twitter, explaining that there were no \u201cfound\u201d ballots, only absentee ballots received the day of the election.", "No Mr. President, there weren\u2019t \u201cfound\u201d ballots. We have known the number of advanced votes since this weekend. We saw record Election Day turnout. As of Monday 970,000 absentees had been accepted. 31k more were added in yesterday\u2019s totals.
