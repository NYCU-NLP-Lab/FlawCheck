["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on May 19, 2020", "An outdated video clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci is circulating on social media \u2014 giving the false impression he is currently advising the public not to wear face masks. Fauci, like other health officials, recommends wearing a cloth face covering when distances of at least six feet can\u2019t be maintained.", "On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its\u00a0earlier position\u00a0on the use of face masks\u00a0during the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0and announced that it was now\u00a0recommending\u00a0that people should\u00a0wear face coverings\u00a0in public, citing new studies on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.", "\u201cWe now know from\u00a0recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (\u2018asymptomatic\u2019) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (\u2018pre-symptomatic\u2019) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms,\u201d the CDC said in its announcement. \u201cIn light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\u201d", "Despite the new guidance, dubious Facebook pages and groups \u2014 some of which advocate alternative\u00a0medicines,\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories\u00a0and\u00a0anti-vaccination\u00a0messages \u2014 have been recently circulating an outdated recommendation on the use of face masks. The pages are sharing a March 8 video\u00a0clip from CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d showing Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be walking around with a mask.\u201d", "But at that point in early March, the CDC\u00a0recommended\u00a0conserving face masks, which were in short supply, for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. So, Fauci gave an answer that was in line with CDC recommendations at that time.", "Here\u2019s what Fauci told Dr. Jon LaPook, chief medical correspondent for CBS News, in the clip circulating on social media:", "LaPook, March 8: There\u2019s a lot of confusion among people, and misinformation, surrounding face masks. Can you discuss that?", "Fauci: The masks are important for someone who\u2019s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else\u2026 Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.", "LaPook: You\u2019re sure of it? Because people are listening really closely to this.", "Fauci: \u2026There\u2019s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you\u2019re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it\u2019s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences \u2014 people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.", "LaPook: And can you get some schmutz, sort of staying inside there?", "Fauci: Of course, of course. But, when you think masks, you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people who, when you look at the films of foreign countries and you see 85% of the people wearing masks \u2014 that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not against it. If you want to do it, that\u2019s fine.", "LaPook:\u00a0But it can lead to a shortage of masks?", "Fauci: Exactly, that\u2019s the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.", "Since then, the science around the novel coronavirus has evolved, Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, explained in an interview with FactCheck.org.", "In early March, so few patients had been tested that public health officials didn\u2019t yet know that people could spread the virus without showing symptoms, said Winslow.", "\u201cThat was just not known at that point,\u201d he said.", "Winslow noted that Fauci appeared to be making two points in the interview. He was pushing back on the idea that a mask could protect the wearer from infection, and he was emphasizing the importance of other measures, such as maintaining a distance of at least six feet between people.", "Both of those things still apply, according to the CDC, which explains on its website that the point of wearing a mask \u201cis to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms.\u201d", "In appearances aired on PBS NewsHour on April 3 and May 12, Fauci again noted the importance of physical distancing and, in line with the evolving public health recommendations, added that cloth face coverings should be used in public.", "But the Facebook pages didn\u2019t share the more up-to-date interviews. Instead, they shared the old interview without noting the date.", "For example, a Facebook page that supports the widely debunked conspiracy-theory video, \u201cPlandemic,\u201d\u00a0shared the old clip on May 6 with the caption, \u201cDr. Anthony Fauci: \u2018There\u2019s no reason to be walking around with a mask.'\u201d That\u2019s the opposite of the advice Fauci was giving by that time.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
