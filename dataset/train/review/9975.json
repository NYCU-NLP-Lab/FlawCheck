People with a clear mind would know what\u2019s going on. To quote a person who worked at a grain depot half their life: \u2018Grain depots don\u2019t catch fire under normal circumstances, even if there is a short circuit, because their walls and roof are made of inflammable materials. Also, there were cases where wooden houses were burned to the ground, but the grains inside only had their surface scorched. I have never seen thick smoke and roaring fire like this, so don\u2019t believe in information from the government about food reserves.\u201d", "Comments under the tweet can be translated as \u201cthe food reverse warehouse is on fire, there must be something sketchy in it!
