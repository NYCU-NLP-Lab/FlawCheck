["About this rating", "In June 2017, according to The New York Times, a Kenyan villager spotted a white giraffe while herding animals near the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy in northeast Kenya. Conservationists and rangers, following up on reports of this sighting, later discovered the completely white female giraffe and her pale calf. Video of the encounter produced what was thought to be the \u201cfirst known video footage of white giraffes\u201d and went viral in September 2017:", "Later, a male white giraffe was discovered with the pair. The animals\u2019 coloring, scientists say, came not from albinism \u2014 a condition that prevents pigmentation of the skin, other soft tissues, and eyes \u2014 but from leucism, a similar condition that leaves eyes unaffected.", "Mohammed Ahmednoor, manager of the reserve that contained the white giraffes, told CNN that the exceedingly rare giraffes were valuable not only because of the draw they had with tourists, but because of what could be learned from them about this rare condition scientifically.", "On March 10, 2020, the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy where the giraffes made their home announced on Twitter that both the female and her calf had been killed, apparently by poachers:", "Kenya's only female white giraffe and her calf have been confirmed dead in Ora, Gaiissa County.

The Conservancy reported that only one white giraffe, the male, remained after the attack:", "Her calf was the second birth reported in August last year, resulting in a family of three white giraffes. After this incident, only a lone bull remains.", "Because the organization that monitors these animals announced it themselves, we rate the claim that poachers killed the only female white giraffe and her calf in Kenya as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "Joseph, Yonette. \u00a0 \"Rare White Giraffes Cause a Stir in Kenya.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 16 September 2017.", "Fleck, K., et al. \u00a0 \"From Single Nucleotide Substitutions up to Chromosomal Deletions: Genetic Pause of Leucism-Associated Disorders in Animals.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr.. \u00a0 July 2016.", "Guzman, Francisco, and Brian Ries. \u00a0 \"Rare White Giraffes Killed by Poachers at Kenyan Wildlife Sanctuary.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 10 March 2020.", "Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy. \u00a0 \"Kenya\u2019s White Giraffe and Calf Confirmed Dead.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 10 March 2020.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
