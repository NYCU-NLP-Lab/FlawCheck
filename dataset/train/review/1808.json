["Time magazine\u2019s cover story \u2018India\u2019s divider-in-chief\u2019 was mooted on social media this week. A sharp critique of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the article, written by journalist and author Aatish Taseer was much discussed with regard to the author\u2019s nationality rather than the contents of the piece itself. The ruling BJP has also dismissed the critique and refused to comment on it, pointing fingers instead at the author\u2019s nationality. Amit Shah, the BJP national president, in an interview with Times Now reverberated the party line. In response to a question about PM Modi\u2019s criticism in the article, he said, \u201cSee I believe the people of this country and their sixth sense is much bigger than any magazine. On 23rd [of May], It will be decided so as to how has Modi performed. According to the information that I have\u2026 an article written by a Pakistani author shouldn\u2019t be taken with such credibility.\u201d", "Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Dr. Sambit Patra reiterated the same claim. He said, \u201cThe man who called Modi divider-in-chief is a Pakistani man, he is a Pakistani citizen. You all know what Pakistan is like. They hate Narendra Modi because he did two surgical strikes on them. What else is there to say? But Rahul Gandhi is tweeting about it.\u201d", "Press Conference by Shri Sambit Patra #DeshKeDilMeiModihttps://t.co/2BwcQVdGfc", "\u2014 BJP MadhyaPradesh (@BJP4MP) May 11, 2019", "BJP national spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain in a sound bite given to Zee News said, \u201cThe one who has written the article is a Pakistani.

In the history of India, if there were the least number of riots under anybody\u2019s rule then it was under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u201d.

Taseer is a British national. He was born in the UK, grew up in India and is currently based out of New York, USA. Speaking to Tiranga TV about the BJP calling him a \u201cPakistani citizen\u201d, Taseer said, \u201cWell I have a very thick hide when it comes to criticism. I want people to speak as freely as they like. But when spokesmen of the BJP comes out and puts forward a lie saying that I am a Pakistani. When he knows very well I grew up in India and I have been to Pakistan as about as many times as you have, that kind of annoys me.\u201d", "Taseer wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal, when he got a green card for the United States of America.", "The Day I Got My Green Card London-born #AatishTaseer never felt he truly belonged in the places he and his family were from: India, Pakistan, Britain.
