["About this rating", "As rumors of an Antifa \"civil war\" circulated on social media, hoax news site The Last Line of Defense published two items: one claiming it attacked an elderly white woman, and a subsequent article suggesting that Malia Obama was arrested in connection with that purported assault.", "The first reported:", "The mainstream media remains silent as the liberal terrorist organization \u201cAntifa\u201d makes good on their promise to spent the anniversary of Donald Trump\u2019s election \u201cmaking white people pay\u201d for overwhelmingly making him President.", "Already there are reports of arson, at least one casualty, and even a kidnapping in Antifa\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d against white Christians. One victim of the Left\u2019s attacks was Mabel Gouldman, a Catholic woman who had stopped at Saint Margaret\u2019s Parish in Cambridge, Massachussetts for confession Saturday afternoon.", "According to local news reports, 97-year-old Gouldman was \u201cbeset upon by four armed thugs wearing black scarves and hoods to conceal their identity.\u201d The four attackers beat Ms. Gouldman with a crowbar, kicking her when she was on the ground. ...", "The follow-up named Malia Obama as one of the purported \"antifa\" antagonists:", "According to Cambridge Sheriff Errol Riggs, those arrested in the incident are:", "[...]\nFreshman Malia Obama", "... It is unclear if Malia Obama is one of the attackers quoted by witnesses, but she is in a whole mess of trouble nonetheless.", "It has long been speculated that the Obama family is racist against whites and this proves it. What Malia Obama got busted doing today is every bit as bad as getting arrested for violence at a KKK rally. So much for the Obama\u2019s not being racist.", "The pieces both caused agitation on social media during a weekend of political tension, but The Last Line of Defense is a fake news site with a clear, if slightly buried, disclaimer:", "DISCLAIMER: America\u2019s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that uses the imagination of liberals to expose the extreme bigotry and hate and subsequent blind gullibility that festers in right-wing nutjobs.
