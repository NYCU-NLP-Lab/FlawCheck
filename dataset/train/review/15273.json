Trump\u2019s margin of victory ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections, as shown in a chart by John Pitney, a professor of\u00a0American politics at Claremont McKenna College, of the Electoral College share won by every president.", "Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton was initially 306 to 232, giving him 56.9 percent of electoral votes. After the electors cast their ballots on Dec. 19, the spread was 304 to 227, with two electors pledged to Trump and five pledged to Clinton casting their votes for someone else. This puts Trump\u2019s percentage of electoral votes at 56.5 percent. But it doesn\u2019t change his standing on Pitney\u2019s list.", "Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight also found that the percentage of electoral votes won by Trump was well below the historical average of 70.9 percent.", "Trump clearly won, but as Pitney told us, \u201cit was no landslide by any accepted definition of that term.\u201d", "\u201cTrump Landslide?

No.\u201d", "Trump continues to sometimes get this statistic right and sometimes get it wrong \u2014 even in the same speech. He\u2019s right in saying that the \u201cmurder rate has experienced its largest increase in our country in 45 years.\u201d But he\u2019s wrong to tell the crowd: \u201cThink of it, the murder rate, more people are being murdered than in 45 years.\u201d", "In fact, the number of murders nationwide was 15,696 in 2015. That\u2019s below the number in 1970, which was 16,000.

When we asked how the president arrives at a doubling of renewable energy production, we were told by the White House that it is excluding\u00a0hydropower\u00a0\u2014 which is the largest source of renewable energy and one of the oldest sources of electrical energy. Why? Because, we were told, the administration has \u201cmainly focused on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.\u201d", "It\u2019s true renewable energy other than hydroelectric power has more than doubled.

We wrote about a similar deficit reduction claim\u00a0that he made in his State of the Union address earlier this year, and we wrote about another deficit claim\u00a0he made in August 2013.", "There are a few things to know about his claim that deficits have been cut by nearly two-thirds. First, the\u00a0president is measuring deficit reduction by the $1.4 trillion deficit in fiscal 2009. It\u2019s true that the FY2009 budget was signed by President George W. Bush, but Obama\u00a0ignores his own contribution to that record-setting deficit. As we\u2019ve written before, Obama\u2019s programs early in his first year increased FY2009 spending \u2014 and thus the deficit \u2014 by as much as $203 billion. Second, the\u00a0deficit for the most recent fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $587 billion \u2014 a 58 percent reduction from Obama\u2019s preferred measure. But that\u2019s just as close to one-half as it is to two-thirds (8 percentage points in either direction). If measured by the $1.2 trillion deficit that he inherited from Bush, then the deficit reduction is closer to half than two-thirds.", "Finally, we note that the annual deficit in FY2016\u00a0increased for the first time in five years. It was up about one-third from the $438.9 billion deficit in FY2015. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects (see Table 1-2) that under current law, annual deficits will continue to rise and again hit $1 trillion in 2024 and beyond. So deficits are trending up, not down, as Obama leaves office.", "\u201cFactChecking the State of the Union,\u201d Jan. 13", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa410204-cf30-4ca9-b709-43f7d45e62d4", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
