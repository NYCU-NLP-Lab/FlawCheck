["About this rating", "Several high-profile European leaders do not have biological children.", "A majority of European leaders have biological children of their own, and others have stepchildren from their spouses' previous marriages.", "On 14 May 2017, the Washington Examiner published a piece article titled \u201cEmmanuel Macron and the Barren Elite of a Changing Continent,\u201d which characterized Europe as being \u201cgoverned by childless Baby Boomers\u201d:", "Emmanuel Macron founded a new party, and his election as France's president is said to herald the \"revival of Europe.\" Interestingly, Macron has no children. This is not that notable in itself. After all, George Washington had no biological children. But across the continent Macron wants to bind closer together, there's a stark pattern:", "German Chancellor Angela Merkel also has no children. British prime minister Theresa May has no children. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni has no children. Holland's Mark Rutte has no children. Sweden's Stefan Lofven has no biological children. Luxembourg's Xavier Bettel has no children. Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon has no children. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, has no children.", "This is too remarkable to ignore. While Macron is young -- 39 years old -- the rest of Europe is being governed by childless Baby Boomers.", "Breitbart News amplified this list in a post on the same topic two months later:", "The list goes on ... Latvia\u2019s childless president is Raimonds V\u0113jonis, Lithuania\u2019s childless president is Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, and Romania\u2019s childless president is Klaus Werner Iohannis.", "Breitbart highlighted these leaders to make a deep-state conspiracy talking point: \u201cThey are not part of a family and have come to see all their attention focused on one dominant and all-powerful social unit to which they pay obeisance and give their complete and devoted attention: The State.\u201d The Examiner posited a different but equally unsubstantiated thesis: \u201ccontemporary childless leaders, however ascendant they feel today, may be the last gasp of secularism ... The future is won by those who show up, and only the religiously orthodox are having children.\u201d", "Without addressing these speculative claims, we note first that both articles\u2019 accounting of European leaders\u2019 children is not 100% accurate; second, their lists are written to exclude the stepchildren of those leaders; and third, their lists ignore, for the sole purpose of making a faulty point, the majority of European leaders with multiple biological children. Below is a table of the leaders mentioned in those articles (which includes Jean-Claude Juncker, who doesn't actually head any country), along with the number of biological or stepchildren each has in their family:", "Posts such as the Examiner\u2019s and Breitbart\u2019s entirely ignore stepchildren, even in cases (like Macron's) when those leaders are reportedly quite close with a spouse's children. For example, Angela Merkel has two stepchildren from her husband\u2019s first marriage, but her husband has made it a stated point to avoid news media coverage of their family life.", "In other cases, the reports are factually incorrect or outdated. Breitbart made the claim that Raimonds V\u0113jonis was the \u201cchildless president\u201d of Latvia, despite the fact that he is married with two children. References from 2017 were correct in stating that previous Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni had no children, but in 2018 Giuseppe Conte took office, and he has a son from a previous marriage.", "Additionally, these posts cast leaders' childless statuses as intentional, discounting cases in which those persons have tried unsuccessfully conceive children. In September 2016, for example, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon opened up to the BBC about having a miscarriage while deputy first minister of Scotland: \u201cSometimes ... having a baby just doesn't happen -- no matter how much we might want it to,\" she said.", "Furthermore, Europe includes far more countries than the 13 chosen to make a point about the continent's supposedly \u201cbarren elite.\u201d While Breitbart did say \u201cthe list goes on\u201d before incorrectly introducing the president of Latvia as childless, their list really did not \u201cgo on\u201d. Below is a table of the 18 remaining European Union countries ignored in these posts, as well as the numbers of their leaders' copious progeny:", "The assertion that most European leaders are childless is false, and the claims presented by the Washington Examiner and Breitbart News cherry-picked countries, misstated facts, and ignored stepchildren in order to make dubious speculative points.", "MacPherson, James. \u00a0 \"Emmanuel Macron and the Barren Elite of a Changing Continent.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Examiner.. \u00a0 14 May 2017.", "Malloch, Theodore Roosevelt . \u00a0 \"MALLOCH: The Tragedy of the European Family.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Breitbart News.. \u00a0 22 July 2017.", "Collins, Lauren. \u00a0 \"Emmanuel Macron and the Modern Family.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New Yorker. \u00a0 5 May 2017.", "Hujar, Marc. \u00a0 \"Das Phantom.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Der Spiegel. \u00a0 1 February 2006.", "Pearson, Allison. \u00a0 \"Theresa May Interview: 'I Probably Was Goody Two Shoes at School\u2019.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Telegraph. \u00a0 21 December 2012.", "Squires, Nick. \u00a0 \"Who Is Giuseppe Conte, Italy's Next Prime Minister?\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Telegraph. \u00a0 21 May 2018.", "DutchNews.nl. \u00a0 \"Ten Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 3 November 2015.", "Expressen. \u00a0 \"Stefan L\u00f6fven Talar Ut Om Sin K\u00e4rlek Till Ulla.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 June 2012.", "Hennebert, Jean-Michel. \u00a0 \"Je Suis Surpris De Devenir Bourgmestre.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 L\u2019essential. \u00a0 11 October 2011.", "BBC News. \u00a0 \"Nicola Sturgeon Miscarriage: First Minister Reveals Baby Loss.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 September 2016.", "Collier, Mike and Mary Sibierski. \u00a0 \"Latvia Elects Vejonis, Eu's First Green President.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Agence France Presse. \u00a0 3 June 2015.", "Phelan, Jessica. \u00a0 \u201cAll the Single Leaders: The World\u2019s Most Eligible Heads of State.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 PRI.org. \u00a0 31 January 2014.", "EVZ.ro. \u00a0 \"Carmen Johannis, Sfetnicul Din Umbr\u0103.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 October 2009.", "Schult, Christoph. \u00a0 \"Juncker's Plan to Succeed Himself.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Spiegel Online. \u00a0 15 July 2013.", "Soussi, Alesdiar. \u00a0 \"Newsmaker: Alexander Van der Bellen.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The National. \u00a0 26 May 2016.", "Cerukus, Laurens. \u00a0 \"Charles Michel Welcomes Baby Girl Jeanne.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Politico. \u00a0 21 January 2016.", "24chasa.bg. \u00a0 \"\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043c\u0430 - \u0432\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0440\u044a\u043c\u043f.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 November 2016.", "tportal.hr. \u00a0 \"Suprug Kolinde Grabar Kitarovi\u0107 Kona\u010dno Iza\u0161ao Iz Sjene.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 18 August 2014.", "presidency.gov.cy. \u00a0 \"Bio.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 26 November 2018.", "tdoma.cz. \u00a0 \"Kate\u0159ina Zemanov\u00e1: Nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed Prezidentova Chlouba.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 26 January 2013.", "Weimann, Annelise. \u00a0 \"Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen Fors\u00f8mte Familien.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Billed Bladet. \u00a0 24 December 2009.", "Ubaleht, Marianne. \u00a0 \"Kersti Kaljulaid Ujub Presidendiakvaariumis \u00dcksinda: Nad on K\u00f5ik Mu Seljataga Olemas, Mu Perekond.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Kroonika. \u00a0 28 September 2016.", "yle.fi. \u00a0 \"Finland's Presidential Couple Welcomes Baby Boy.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 3 February 2018.", "in.gr. \u00a0 \"\u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf \u03ad\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 18 February 2015.", "Xinhua. \u00a0 \"Hungarian PM Nominates Janos Ader as President.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 17 April 2012.", "Boland, Rosita. \u00a0 \"New Lady of the \u00c1ras.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Irish Times. \u00a0 5 November 2011.", "eve.com.mt. \u00a0 \"Malta\u2019s New President: Inauguration Day\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 4 April 2014.", "tvn24.pl. \u00a0 \u201c\u2018Pierwsza C\u00f3rka\u2019 Kinga.
