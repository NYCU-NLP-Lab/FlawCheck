They wrote that in there because they knew the danger of corrupting our system by foreign money is enormous,\" Gingrich said. \"You had a sitting secretary of state whose husband radically increased his speech fees, you have a whole series of dots on the wall now where people gave millions of dollars \u2014 oh, by the way, they happen to get taken care of by the State Department.\"", "He continued, \"My point is they took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of State. That is clearly illegal.\"", "PunditFact wanted to know if a criminal case against Clinton is that open and shut. Is what happened \"clearly illegal\"?", "A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation certainly disagreed, calling Gingrich\u2019s accusation \"a baseless leap\" because Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while serving as a senator or secretary of state. We did not hear from Gingrich by our deadline.", "Foundation basics", "Former President Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, the year after Hillary Clinton won her first term as a New York senator. The foundation works with non-governmental organizations, the private sector and governments around the world on health, anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change initiatives. Spokesman Craig Minassian said it\u2019s reasonable for the foundation to accept money from foreign governments because of the global scope of its programs, and the donations are usually in the form of tailored grants for specific missions.", "Hillary Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while she was a senator or\u00a0secretary of state. Her appointment to the latter post required Senate confirmation and came with an agreement between the White House and Clinton Foundation that the foundation would be more transparent about its donors.", "According to the 2008 memorandum of understanding, the foundation would release information behind new donations and could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If countries with existing contributions significantly stepped up their contributions, or if a new foreign government wanted to donate, the State Department would have to approve.", "Clinton took an active role in fundraising when she left the State Department and the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. But she left the board when she announced her run for the presidency in April 2015.", "The Emoluments Clause", "So how does Gingrich come up with the claim that Clinton Foundation donations are \"clearly illegal\" and unconstitutional?", "The answer is something known as the Emoluments Clause. A few conservative websites have made similar arguments in recent days, including the Federalist blog. The Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part:", "\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"", "The framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence.

There\u2019s no mention of spouses in the memo.", "J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center, said interpretation of the clause has evolved since its adoption at the Constitutional Convention, when the primary concern was about overseas diplomats not seeking gifts from foreign powers they were dealing with. The Defense Department memo, in his view, goes beyond what the framers envisioned for the part of the memo dealing with gifts.", "\"I think that, aside from the unambiguous parts, the burden would be on those invoking the clause to show actual causality that would be in violation of the clause,\" Pham said.", "Expert discussion", "We asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were \"clearly illegal\" and a violation of the Emoluments Clause.", "We did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich.", "The American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, \"even if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,\" said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced.", "\"I very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee\u2019s relative,\" he said. \"Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing.

Kopel also brought up bribery statutes, which would require that a gift had some influence in Clinton\u2019s decision while secretary of state.", "Delahunty thought Kopel\u2019s reasoning would have \"strange consequences,\" such as whether a state-owned airline flying Bill Clinton to a conference of former heads of state counted\u00a0as a gift to Hillary Clinton.", "Our ruling", "Gingrich said the Clinton Foundation \"took money from from foreign governments while (Hillary Clinton) was secretary of state.

She was not part of the foundation her husband founded while she was secretary of state.", "Does that violate the Constitution?", "Some libertarian-minded constitutional law experts say it very well could.
