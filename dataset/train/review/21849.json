["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "Ohio Board of Regents Chancellor Jim Petro was firing up the troops. \n\nDuring a speech Aug. 11, 2011, at Ohio State University to announce a new \"enterprise university\" plan aimed at cutting red tape for public universities, Petro preached to his audience of higher education types why pushing up the college graduation rate in Ohio is so important. \n\nOnly 26 percent of Ohioans hold a bachelor\u2019s degree, Petro told his audience. Raising that figure toward the national average of 31 percent would give Ohio\u2019s economy a tremendous boost. \n\nWhile Petro told the crowd he\u2019s seen various estimates of the economic impact of a rising bachelor\u2019s degree rate, he said he had a \"solid\" and \"good\" estimate. Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor\u2019s degrees, Petro said, would mean multiple billions a year in sustained economic growth. \n\n\"For every percent we move up, it means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars,\" he said. \n\nWhile the correlation between education levels and higher wages for individuals is fairly well-established, we were struck by the specific price tag Petro was able to put on Ohioans getting their sheepskins. So PolitiFact Ohio checked it out. \n\nSpencer Waugh, a policy liaison for the Ohio Board of Regents, sent us three documents to corroborate Petro\u2019s claim. In an e-mail, Waugh said Petro\u2019s estimate of $2.5 billion is \"fair and conservative\" given that some studies show less and at least one study shows more. \n\nThe first document was a memo from Waugh to Petro which claimed that a 1 percent jump in Ohioans with bachelor\u2019s degrees would net an income increase of $1.09 billion. Waugh\u2019s memo multiples the number of new Ohioans with bachelor\u2019s degrees by $19,000 a year \u2014 a figure he says represents the annual gain for those going from holding a high school diploma to a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nWaugh\u2019s figures were based on a data from the National Center for Education Statistics as well as 2007 census data, according to Kim Norris, Petro\u2019s communications director. \n\nThe 2007 census data states that the gap is $20,000 per year for adults. The National Center for Education Statistics data shows the gap at $18,000 for males but only $15,000 for females in the age group of 25-34. So $19,000 is in the ballpark.\n\nUsing the $19,000 multiplier assumes that everyone who went back to school and got the bachelor\u2019s degree had only achieved a high school education. Presumably some in that group would be people who already have associate\u2019s degrees or \"some college\" and didn\u2019t have far to go to get a bachelor\u2019s degree. People who have \"some college\" or an associate\u2019s degree generally make more than those with just a high school diploma, and that would have an impact on net benefit to Ohio\u2019s economy. \n\nRegardless, the figure is well below Petro\u2019s estimate of $2.5 billion.\n\nThe second document is a memo from Board of Regents staffer Patrick Maloney to Petro which outlines a 2008 Arizona State University study which found that a 1 percent jump would add $1.5 billion to that state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe ASU study focuses solely on Arizona and relies on a 2004 Journal of Econometrics paper that estimated the effects on the earnings of all working adults from increasing the proportion of the workforce with a university degree. It used data from the 1980 and 1990 census. \n\nHowever, the paper\u2019s author, Enrico Moretti, didn\u2019t specify how he defined adults nor how he calculated hourly wages. And Moretti finds a \"spillover effect\" which pushes up wages for all workers on every education level as the share of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree increases.\n\nBecause Moretti\u2019s spillover effect requires different calculations over each level of educational attainment, it\u2019s virtually impossible to compare Arizona to Ohio as the states have different profiles. Additionally, Arizona\u2019s labor market is much smaller than Ohio\u2019s with only 1.82 million workers year-round versus 5.11 million in Ohio \u2014 nearly three times as many. \n\nIf the gains projected in Arizona would come true in Ohio, then you could probably assume an economic benefit of nearly three times what was projected for Arizona -- about $4 billion a year. \n\nThe third study cited by Waugh comes from a CEO for Cities study, which concludes that an improvement of 1 percentage point in each of the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the United State would increase aggregate personal income by $124 billion nationwide. \n\nIn the report, the authors explain that each additional percentage point in aggregate adult four-year college attainment was associated with a $763 increase in annual regional per capita income.\n\nPer capita income refers to the income of each man, women and child. If we apply the increase to Ohio\u2019s \u00a011.5 million population, we get an additional $8.8 billion a year in income.\n\nSo where does all this leave Petro\u2019s claim? \n\nAs chancellor of the Board of Regents, Petro wanted to show the importance of more adults getting their college degrees. \n\nTo underscore this point, Petro claimed that a \"good and solid\" estimate showed that increasing the number of bachelor\u2019s degree holders in Ohio by 1 percent would increase \"economic activity\" in the state by $2.5 billion a year. \n\nAsked for studies to prove this point, Petro\u2019s staffers muster a pair of memos which assert Ohio\u2019s income would rise by $1.09 billion a year and another which estimates that Arizona\u2019s would rise by $1.5 billion a year. The Arizona estimate would extrapolate to about $4 billion in Ohio given the larger labor market here. \n\nLastly, they cite a study done on the nation\u2019s biggest urban areas, which if applied to Ohio\u2019s population would mean $8.8 billion in additional income. \n\nThe underlying point in Petro\u2019s statement is accurate -- that raising the percentage of Ohioans who have a bachelor\u2019s degree would benefit Ohio\u2019s economy. \n\nWhat is less clear is how great that benefit would be. Petro\u2019s estimate was $2.5 billion. But the supporting documentation his staff provided shows that estimates very wildly. \n\nIs it $1 billion? $4 billion? $8.8 billion? \u00a0Something in between?\n\nThat\u2019s a point that needs clarification. \n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter the claim rates as Mostly True.", "Ohio Channel, \u00a0Board of Regents Chancellor Jim Petro remarks at Ohio State University, Aug. 11, 2011.
