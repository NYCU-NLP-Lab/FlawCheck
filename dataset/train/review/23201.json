["A radio ad attacking former Gov.

The bill also allowed law enforcement to destroy bulky grow house equipment and simply take photos or video. While law enforcement widely supported the bill, advocates for marijuana and the ACLU of Florida opposed it.", "The bill passed the Senate unanimously and only one representative, Broward Democrat Evan Jenne, voted against it. Jenne told PolitiFact Florida that he opposed the provision that allowed law enforcement to destroy evidence.", "Though Crist signed the bill, the champion of it was then-Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum, who two years later lost a primary in the governor\u2019s race against Scott.", "William Shepherd, who worked for McCollum at the time, said he doesn\u2019t know what \"harshest\" would mean or how Florida\u2019s law compared to other states.

Marijuana possession over 20 grams, as well as the cultivation of even a single pot plant, are defined by law as felony offenses \u2013 punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\"", "A Progressive Choice Florida spokeswoman cited an analysis of state laws and sentencing guidelines written by Jon Gettman, a former NORML director.
