NASA always receives blessings from the Pope before embarking on any space mission. No matter how advanced the science is, they still travel upon receiving God\u2019s blessings. The bible is their rudder, we truly cannot treat God\u2019s creation as a plaything, God\u2019s permission must be sought. That is why even during the mission to the moon, the official flag of the Catholic council was taken. NASA says, \u201cFrom the moment we embark on a mission, the Pope prays for us. That is our only strength.\u201d", "The graphic also features four photos of two different popes speaking to astronauts in space.", "A similar claim\u00a0was\u00a0also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here.", "The claim, however, is misleading.", "While multiple popes have blessed NASA missions, the photos used in the graphic do not show papel blessing being bestowed \u201cbefore\u201d a mission begins, as the Facebook posts claim.", "The two\u00a0photos on the left-hand side of the photo collage\u00a0show Pope Francis speaking to NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS) in October 2017, as seen here in a NASA statement.", "The Pope \u201coffered his blessings and asked that they, too, pray for him in return,\u201d according to NASA.", "The other photo of Pope Francis in 2017 was published by the Associated Press here.", "The conversation between Pope Francis and\u00a0NASA and ESA\u00a0astronauts can be seen here on NASA's YouTube channel.", "The two photos on the right-hand side of the photo collage show Pope Benedict XVI speaking to astronauts on the ISS in May 2011.", "NASA published the full conversation on YouTube here.
