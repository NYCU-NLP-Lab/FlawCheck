John Kasich for president at a rally in Columbus. Jay LaPrete / AP", "Hoping to add some political muscle to Republican John Kasich\u2019s bid for the White House, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed the Ohio governor for president during a rally in Columbus this week.", "But did Schwarzenegger, a fellow Republican, bend the truth when he described Ohio\u2019s financial turnaround under Kasich?", "In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger called Kasich an \"action hero,\" saying that when Kasich became governor in 2011, \"there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there\u2019s a $2 billion surplus.\"", "We decided to check that claim. Kasich has made similar statements throughout his campaign for president, and highlighted this fiscal transformation on his website.", "\"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus,\" Kasich said during the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland last year.", "The national PolitiFact team took a deeper look at Kasich\u2019s claim last August.", "It\u2019s very similar to Schwarzenegger\u2019s claim. Here\u2019s what it found:", "An $8 billion hole?", "There\u2019s an argument for $8 billion, but there\u2019s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011.", "The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich\u2019s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with \"conceptually\" in a 2011 interview, though he took issue with some of the methodological details.", "Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this as a \"hole\" rather than a deficit. Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. Schwarzenegger used the term \"deficit,\" which we interpreted as a minor misstatement rather than an attempt to deceive.", "A $2 billion surplus?", "This figure is clearer. Ohio\u2019s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state\u2019s \"rainy day fund\" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. The surplus remained above $2 billion this week, said a spokesman for the budget office.", "Does Kasich deserve credit?", "It\u2019s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state\u2019s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state\u2019s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. Schwarzenegger\u2019s claim strongly implies Kasich played a central role in the turnaround, though it doesn\u2019t explicitly link the two together.", "But it\u2019s important to remember that Kasich took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio\u2019s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. As of December, the national unemployment rate was 5 percent and the rate in Ohio was 4.8 percent. So Kasich\u2019s timing has been fortunate.", "Our ruling", "In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger said that when Kasich became governor, \"there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there\u2019s a $2 billion surplus.\"", "Kasich said, \"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus.\"", "It\u2019s possible to argue over whether the starting point should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich and Schwarzenegger didn\u2019t pull that figure out of thin air, though it certainly was high by historical standards. Kasich also used the term \"hole,\" which is more appropriate than \"deficit.\" Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that \"I\" did it, since the state\u2019s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery.", "The statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.", "YouTube video, Arnold Schwarzenegger's speech endorsing John Kasich, March 6, 2016", "PolitiFact, \"John Kasich: 'I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus,' August 6, 2015", "Ohio Office of Budget and Management, \"Ohio's Rainy Day Savings Account Surpasses $2 Billion with a New Record-High Balance,\" July 2015", "Cleveland Plain Dealer, \"Ohio's $8 billion budget hole: Was it really that big?\" May 29, 2011", "Cleveland Plain Dealer, \"Does the RGA's pro-John Kasich ad measure up?\" June 6, 2014", "Cleveland Plain Dealer, \"Decoding John Kasich: Looking at the Ohio governor's words and record as he looks at 2016,\" May 1, 2015", "Cincinnati Enquirer, \"Fact check: John Kasich\u2019s speech,\" July 22, 2015", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics (main index page), accessed Aug. 6, 2015, and March 8, 2016", "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (main index page), accessed Aug. 6, 2015 and March 8, 2016", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
