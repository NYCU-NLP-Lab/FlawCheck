["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on September 20, 2016", "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid claimed that Zika \u201caffects everyone\u201d \u2014 not just pregnant women and their babies \u2014 because recent research found that it \u201ccauses people to go blind.\u201d That\u2019s false. Temporary vision impairment is a symptom of Zika, but no adults have gone blind because of the virus.", "In fact, one author of a study cited by Reid\u2019s office told us his study \u201cdid not claim\u201d that Zika causes blindness. The study found that the virus \u201cinfects specific target cells in different regions of the eye.\u201d Some infected mice in the study experienced inflammation, but none went blind.", "However, studies have shown that severe vision impairment\u00a0is a Zika-related birth defect.", "The Zika epidemic first began\u00a0in Brazil in May 2015. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak\u00a0a global public health emergency in\u00a0February 2016.\u00a0The first locally acquired infections in the U.S. were reported in Puerto Rico on Dec. 31, 2015, and in Florida on\u00a0July 29, 2016.", "On Aug. 12, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared\u00a0a public health emergency in Puerto Rico. On Aug. 1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advised pregnant women to avoid an area of Miami where health officials had identified local Zika transmission.\u00a0The CDC defines a \u201clocal\u201d case as one transmitted through a mosquito bite on U.S. soil.", "Zika spreads \u201cprimarily through the bite of an infected\u00a0Aedes\u00a0species mosquito,\u201d says the CDC. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and through sex and blood transfusions. However, the CDC is investigating whether Zika also spreads via bodily fluids, such as saliva, vomit or urine.", "On Feb. 22, President Obama\u00a0submitted\u00a0a request to Congress for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat Zika, but Republicans and Democrats in Congress have yet to agree on legislation.\u00a0In the partisan battle, Republicans and Democrats, including Reid, have blamed each other for stalling the legislation,\u00a0although a compromise could come as early as today.", "Reid made some additional comments concerning Zika that aren\u2019t exactly accurate. We will address those, too, but first we will focus on his claim about blindness.", "Reid exaggerated what scientists know about the health effects of Zika on vision on at least three occasions \u2014\u00a0on the Senate floor,\u00a0while answering questions posed by the press and\u00a0during a news conference.", "Reid, Sept. 7, on the Senate floor:\u00a0One of America\u2019s pronounced scientists today said that now Zika affects everybody. Zika is now infecting eyes \u2013 the virus goes in people\u2019s eyes and leads to vision impairment and blindness. So it\u2019s not just women of child-bearing age. It is going to affect a lot of people.", "Reid, Sept. 7, answering press questions:\u00a0One of the op-eds today was from a physician, well known, reputable professor. He said he\u2019s very concerned because they keep finding new things that this virus affects. For example, eyes. Now, in certain cases, they\u2019ve proven that the virus goes into people\u2019s eyes and certainly impairs your vision and causes people to go blind. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t affect only women of child-bearing age. It affects everyone.", "Reid, Sept. 8, during a news conference: Yesterday we learned that scientists have found that the Zika virus goes into people\u2019s eyes causing blindness and a lot of visual impairment.", "To be clear, many people who contract Zika\u00a0have\u00a0little or no symptoms. When individuals do have symptoms, they last around a week and can entail\u00a0fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis, or pinkeye.", "But \u201cZika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is associated with other pregnancy problems,\u201d\u00a0explains\u00a0the CDC. Zika can cause\u00a0underdeveloped heads and brains (microcephaly) in newborns. The virus is also \u201clinked to other problems in infants,\u201d such as eye defects, hearing loss\u00a0and impaired growth.", "When we contacted Reid\u2019s office, Dan Yoken, Reid\u2019s deputy communications director, referred us to a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.", "Lipkin\u2019s piece mentions nothing about Zika-related blindness or vision impairment in adults or newborns, though he does discuss the potential wider societal costs of a generation of children born with Zika-related defects.", "Yoken also referred us to two research papers, one published in Cell Reports on Sept. 6, and another published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 28. Neither of them directly supported Reid\u2019s claims about Zika and blindness.", "In fact, we contacted the authors of the first paper, and Michael S. Diamond,\u00a0an expert in infectious diseases and virology at Washington University in St. Louis, told us his study \u201cdid not claim\u201d that \u201cthe Zika virus goes into people\u2019s eyes causing blindness and a lot of visual impairment,\u201d as Reid said.", "What did the researchers find?", "After infecting mice under the skin with Zika, the group found that the virus \u201cinfects specific target cells in different regions of the eye.\u201d The scientists also uncovered\u00a0Zika\u2019s genetic material in the tears of mice, which suggests the virus could be transmitted through this bodily fluid. Like humans, some infected mice in their study experienced inflammation in different regions of the eye, including conditions such as panuveitis and conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. None of the mice went blind.", "It\u2019s worth noting that a study published in the Journal for the American Medical Association Ophthalmology on Sept. 15 confirmed Zika genetic material on the eyes of human adults.", "The July study\u00a0cited by Reid\u2019s office outlined the case of a man in his early 40s whose vision in one eye dropped from 20/40 to 20/60 acuity after contracting Zika, a condition called uveitis. After treatment, the man\u2019s vision returned to 20/40. In other words, he didn\u2019t go blind, and his vision was only impaired temporarily.\u00a0If untreated, this condition can lead to permanent vision loss.", "Likewise, the September Cell Reports\u00a0paper also explains, \u201cThe most common form of ZIKV-induced ocular disease is conjunctivitis, which occurs in 10% to 15% of [human] patients, but whether conjunctivitis is a direct consequence of ZIKV infection of the eye is not known. In contrast, ZIKV-induced uveitis is less common, although it has been described in humans.\u201d", "When we contacted Reid\u2019s office again to point out that the cited research didn\u2019t support Reid\u2019s claims, Yoken responded by stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know all the effects of the Zika virus. Senator Reid was citing published research into the virus that has raised questions about Zika and how it affects vision and the eye. Sen. Reid could have been more exact in describing the results of the [Cell Reports] study.\u201d", "We agree on all accounts.", "It\u2019s worth mentioning that at least three studies have shown that mothers infected with Zika during pregnancy can give birth to babies with severe vision impairment. However, the generalizability of these studies is limited, given that one study\u00a0evaluated vision impairment in\u00a0one child, a second study\u00a0examined three children, and a third\u00a0study evaluated 29 babies. The last study found vision abnormalities in roughly a third of the babies considered.", "An author on the third study, Rubens Belfort Jr., told CNN, \u201cThese are severe retina lesions that will impede the ability of the children [in his study] to see well.\u201d An expert in ophthalmology at the Federal University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, he added, \u201cMany of these children could be blind.\u201d", "In fact, on Sept. 6, Reid did correctly summarize Zika-related birth defects when he said on the Senate floor that newborns with Zika also suffer from \u201cvision impairment.\u201d", "To be clear, we do not aim\u00a0to minimize the gravity of the Zika epidemic. And we agree with Reid when he said that \u201cwe need more study\u201d\u00a0in order to understand the effects of the virus on both newborns and adults. But at present, there isn\u2019t conclusive research to support Reid\u2019s statements on Sept. 7 and 8.", "On Sept. 6 on the Senate floor, Reid said, \u201c2,000 Puerto Ricans are infected each week\u201d with Zika.\u00a0The number of new Zika cases peaked at roughly 1,900 infections in the second\u00a0week of August, according to the territory\u2019s health department.", "As of Sept. 15, Puerto Rican health officials have confirmed 19,967 cases of Zika infection total. The U.S. territory also has seen one fetus born with Zika-related birth defects.", "When we asked about Reid\u2019s claim, Yoken cited\u00a0a Sept. 2\u00a0article from NBC\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth station, which states: \u201cSome 2,000 people a week are getting infected and, if current trends hold, a quarter of the island\u2019s 3.5 million people could get Zika by the end of this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d", "But as of Sept. 14, the CDC also stated:\u00a0\u201cThe Puerto Rico Department of Health is retroactively reporting cases, resulting in larger than normal increases in cases in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0The territory has seen roughly 570 new infections on average each week since the first case was confirmed on Dec. 31, 2015.", "To be clear, the number of actual infections may be\u00a0higher than the number of reported cases. For example, CDC Director Tom Frieden told STAT, a health and science news website, in June that as many as 2 percent of adults in the territory could be infected monthly.", "While Reid\u2019s statement may turn out to be correct once all the data come in, at this point 2,000 cases per week is not quite right.", "Reid also claimed, \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control predict by the end of the year 25 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s population will be infected by Zika.\u201d But that\u2019s\u00a0a worst-case scenario prediction, the CDC told us.", "Yoken of Reid\u2019s office pointed us to a Wall Street Journal article from June 8 that did\u00a0state, \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 25% of Puerto Rico\u2019s 3.5 million population will be infected with Zika by the end of 2016,\u201d quoting Tyler Sharp, a CDC epidemiologist based in San Juan.", "But\u00a0Benjamin Haynes, a spokesman for the CDC, told us by email, \u201cThe projection of 25% was based on \u2018worst case\u2019 projections based on weekly incidence and looking at the spread of chikungunya in previous outbreaks. Obviously interventions can affect that number and it\u2019s too soon to tell. The projection was more of a \u2018could be\u2019 if the rates of transmission continued to accelerate at the same pace. That also assumes there are no interventions or preventive measures in place to slow the spread of the virus.\u201d", "Lastly, Reid exaggerated the extent to which Zika has spread in the continental U.S. when he said, \u201cLocal transmission of Zika was confirmed in Florida and elsewhere.\u201d", "According to the CDC, local transmission of the virus has taken place only in Florida.\u00a0As of Sept. 15, the state\u2019s health department has reported 77 locally acquired Zika infections. Ten\u00a0non-Florida residents have also contracted the virus while visiting the state.", "Yoken told us by email that \u201cSenator Reid misspoke\u201d when he said \u201cand elsewhere,\u201d pertaining to Zika\u2019s spread in the continental U.S. \u201cThis was corrected in our released remarks,\u201d Yoken added.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b592ca8f-988f-42b8-a780-6c1ec5d7d303", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
