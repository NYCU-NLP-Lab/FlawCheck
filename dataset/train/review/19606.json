["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on March 23, 2018", "Q: Did the FBI raid Barack Obama\u2019s Washington D.C. home?", "A: No. That claim originated in a story on a self-described satirical website.", "Barack and Michelle Obama bought their house in the tony Washington, D.C. neighborhood of Kalorama in May 2017.", "Since then, that house has not been raided by the FBI. But a bogus story circulating online claims that it has been.", "Facebook users were right to flag as potentially false a story with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: FBI Executes Search Warrant At Obama D.C. Mansion.\u201d", "The story originated on reaganwasright.com, which is part of a network of sites that labels its content as satire and tells readers in a disclaimer that, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d", "But stories published on those websites are often copied and reposted by sites that have no such disclaimer. That\u2019s what happened in this case.", "It\u2019s been posted on at least half a dozen other websites since it was first published in September 2017. It was recently reposted on a site called kosalb.info on March 21.", "The story starts with a reference to President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election. The rest of it is a fictional account of an imagined FBI raid on the Obamas\u2019 home that uncovered evidence of a surveillance program.", "Shelly Smithers, the person quoted as an FBI spokeswoman, is fictional, too. That\u2019s the name of a character in a 2013 mystery novel about the FBI.", "The story also says that the FBI would release a statement about the raid, but there is no record of any such statement from the bureau.", "Not only was there no raid, the story doesn\u2019t even get the price of the Obamas\u2019 home correct. According to the deed and related information on file with the Office of Tax and Revenue in D.C., Homefront Holdings, LLC. (which is controlled by Barack Obama) purchased the Tudor style house in May 2017 for $8.1 million, not $8.9 million, as the false story says.", "Also, the photos that appear in the bogus story have nothing to do with Obama. One shows an FBI agent carrying boxes out of a Dearborn, Michigan, home in June 2017, and the other shows a San Francisco-area mansion during a raid in 2006.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "\u201cBREAKING: FBI Executes Search Warrant At Obama D.C.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
