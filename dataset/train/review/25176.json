["By D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on August 28, 2017", "A GOP super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a digital campaign ad about \u201cChemtrail Kelli\u201d that could leave Arizona voters with a false impression about Republican Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s 2018 primary opponent.", "The ad, sponsored by the Senate Leadership Fund, says Dr. Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator, \u201cwasted your tax dollars for a town hall on \u2018chemtrail\u2019 conspiracy theories.\u201d It also uses audio of Ward saying \u201cof course\u201d she would hold another hearing about chemtrails, and shows video of Ward saying she would be \u201copen\u201d to sponsoring legislation on the issue, too. \u201cChemtrail Kelli\u2019s got her head in the clouds with crazy ideas,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.", "But Ward has said before that she doesn\u2019t believe in the debunked theory\u00a0that the cloud-like trails of condensed water vapor made by airplanes are actually chemicals being used by the government or others to change weather patterns and for other nefarious purposes. Ward said she only held the hearing to address constituent concerns.", "The Senate Leadership Fund released the video attacking Ward on Aug. 22. The super PAC spent $10,000 to \u201ctarget key audiences in Arizona and Washington, DC\u201d over three days. Ward lost\u00a0to Sen. John McCain in the 2016 Republican primary and is now challenging Flake \u2014 Arizona\u2019s other Republican senator \u2014 in 2018.", "The ad correctly says that Ward accused McCain\u00a0of being \u201cdirectly responsible for the rise\u201d of the Islamic State terrorist organization. And Ward, as the ad claims, also said that McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in July, \u201cshould step away as quickly as possible,\u201d and that she \u201cshould be \u2026 at the top of the list\u201d of candidates to fill his Senate seat.", "But it\u2019s the ad\u2019s claims about chemtrails \u2014 which Ward has said she doesn\u2019t believe in \u2014 that could mislead viewers.", "\u201cOne year ago, Arizona Republicans rejected \u2018Chemtrail Kelli Ward,'\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cRemember why? Ward wasted your tax dollars for a town hall on chemtrail conspiracy theories.\u201d", "Ward did hold an informational meeting about the issue on June 25, 2014. In a Facebook post that month, Ward wrote: \u201cI will be hosting ADEQ in Kingman at the BOS auditorium on June 25 at 5PM to discuss how the Department works to assure safe air and water and to address community concerns about chemtrails.\u201d", "Two representatives from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality were present to answer the questions of concerned constituents who attended the hearing.", "The Arizona Republic, which covered the event, wrote: \u201cAlthough Ward billed Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Kingman as an exchange about environmental quality in her legislative district, the audience was focused on so-called \u2018chemtrails\u2019 and their effect on plant and human life.\u201d", "Sherri Zendri, the ADEQ administrative counsel, made clear that she was not at the meeting to answer any science-related questions about chemtrails.", "\u201cI am not here to debate the science of aircraft engine emissions,\u201d Zendri said. \u201cI am not a scientist. I am an ADEQ environmental policy specialist. I can talk to you about jurisdiction. I can talk to you about some of the processes in our programs, how things get done. I am not a scientist. So, if you are here to hear some information about the science, the validity of aircraft engine emissions, I apologize. You will probably be disappointed. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for.\u201d", "Zendri said that Arizona, particularly the Department of Environmental Quality, has no jurisdiction over aircraft engine emissions.", "Later, when a resident raised the possibility of Ward introducing legislation about chemtrails, Ward did say that she would be \u201copen\u201d to it. That\u2019s the part of her answer that is featured in the ad.", "But in her full response, Ward indicated that there would be problems introducing such a bill.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll just say I don\u2019t know,\u201d Ward started. \u201cIf there were a way, I mean, I\u2019m open. I introduce legislation for constituents all the time. It\u2019s not my legislation. A lot of times I\u2019m getting things from people. So, if it\u2019s something that can be done in Arizona statute, I\u2019m always willing to entertain that. With this particular issue, I think it is going to be difficult because unless you get away from the chemtrail issue that you all are so passionate about, talking about our environmental quality I think can go farther in terms of making sure that there aren\u2019t any public health issues that are out there with our water, our soil, or our air.\u201d", "And earlier, Ward told the audience that there was likely little she could do. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything that Arizona can do, but it\u2019s good to get the information out,\u201d she said.", "More important, Ward has said several times before that she doesn\u2019t believe in chemtrails.", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the chemtrail theory,\u201d she told Politico in an April 2015 interview. And in a tweet later that month, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve never believed it \u2014 many in my district do.\u201d", "That was after Ward told the Arizona Republic in March that \u201cI don\u2019t really have any opinions about \u2018chemtrails\u2019 one way or the other.\u201d She said, \u201cI think that environmental quality, though is very important.", "Then, as the ad points out, Ward, during a 2016 radio interview, said: \u201cOf course I would do it again,\u201d when talking about the town hall she held about chemtrails. She said that she\u2019d do so because that is what elected officials do.", "\u201cPeople say, well, would you do it again?\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I would do it again because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when you\u2019re elected. You\u2019re supposed to listen to the people and you\u2019re supposed to get them the information they need to feel confident that they live in a safe environment.\u201d", "But Ward\u2019s willingness to hold another town hall on the issue doesn\u2019t mean that she believes in the theory. That may not have been clear to viewers of\u00a0the ad.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
