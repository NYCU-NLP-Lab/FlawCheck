We decided to take a new look through the lens of the latest available data.", "War casualties", "The most comprehensive list we found on U.S. war dead was compiled in January 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. It included casualties from the Revolutionary War through Operation Inherent Resolve, which is targeting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.", "The number of U.S. dead in all those conflicts comes to nearly 1.2 million, according to the research service.", "We should add a qualifier here: The research service says that during the Civil War, the nation\u2019s deadliest conflict, Union and Confederate losses combined were 525,000 to 530,000.

A CDC chart shows 24,000 gun deaths occurred that year.", "With that in mind, the figure of 1.5 million deaths since November 1963 surely is an underestimate of the level of gun violence since then, because it excludes four years. The actual number probably is close to 1.6 million.", "A key thing to know about these figures: They include not just murders but all gun deaths. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides; 33 percent were homicides; and the rest were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes.", "Our ruling", "The Virginia Center for Public Safety says that since 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire than have been killed in all U.S. wars.", "Figures going back to 1968 show about 1.5 million firearms deaths have occurred since then. That doesn\u2019t include data from gun deaths from 1963 to 1967, years for which figures aren\u2019t available, so this is a conservative estimate on firearms deaths since Kennedy was assassinated.", "In contrast, a high-side figure for U.S. war deaths shows that about 1.4 million service members have been killed in conflicts.", "So we rate the claim True.", "Virginia Center for Public Safety brochure for the 24th Annual Vigil & Advocacy Day, Jan. 18, 2016.", "Email from Andrew Goddard, legislative director for the Virginia Center for Public Safety, jan. 19, 2016.", "Centers for Disease Control Wonder, \"Compressed mortality file,\" accessed Jan. 21, 2016.", "Emails from the Centers for Disease Control Wonder staff, Jan. 21, 2016.", "Congressional Research Service, \"American war and military operations casualties: Lists and Statistics,\" Jan. 2, 2015.", "Veterans Administration, \"America\u2019s Wars,\" May 2015.", "PolitiFact, \"PBS commentator Mark Shields says more killed by guns since \u201868 than in all U.S. wars,\" Jan. 18, 2013.", "PolitiFact, \"More Americans killed by guns since 1968, than in all U.S. wars, columnist Nicholas Kristof writes,\" Aug. 27, 2015.", "The New York Times, \"New estimate raises the Civil War death toll,\" April 2, 2012.", "Centers for Disease Control, \"Deaths resulting from firearms and motor vehicle accidents,\" Jan. 28, 1994.", "The New York Times, \"Gun deaths are mostly suicides,\" Oct.. 8,. 2015.", "MilitaryFactory.com, \"American war deaths through history,\" Jan. 19, 2016.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
