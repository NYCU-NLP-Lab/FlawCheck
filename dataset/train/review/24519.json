["About this rating", "The Fukushima nuclear disaster had lingering negative effects on wildlife.", "A series of photos show the direct effects the nuclear disaster had on marine life.", "In February 2016, a series of photos purportedly showing the ill effects that the Fukushima nuclear disaster had\u00a0on marine life was\u00a0widely shared on social media. A popular\u00a0Facebook post, which appeared to be a rewrite of an\u00a0article\u00a0published by web site\u00a0Superstation95 in October 2015, reported\u00a0that North Americans were\u00a0eating seafood filled with \"cancerous tumors\":\nAmericans and Canadians have been eating radioactive fish filled with bloody, cancerous tumors, as a result of contamination with radiation in the Pacific ocean from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.", "While the Daiichi meltdowns and subsequent radiation releases did have a major effect on aquatic life, these photos do not illustrate those effects. For instance, the lead photo of the article, purportedly showing the \"bloody\" and \"cancerous\" tumors caused by\u00a0nuclear radiation, was actually taken in 2004, years before the Fukushima disaster started leaking radiation into the sea:\n\nSuperstation 95\u00a0touted these images as undeniable proof of Fukushima's effect on seafood:\nThe government and the nuclear power industry claim we have nothing to worry about. When you see the photos below, you may want decide for yourself if they're telling the truth.\n  The article then shows a picture of \"cancerous tumors in salmon\" purportedly linked to a rise in nuclear radiation in oceans:\n\nAgain, however, the above-displayed image was taken prior to the Fukushima disaster. The image also does not show cancerous tumors, or any type of tumor at all. \u00a0Instead, it was lifted from Wikipedia, and\u00a0shows\u00a0a salmon infected with with Henneguya salminicola, a\u00a0myxosporean parasite.\nAnother misleading photo featured University of Alberta scientist David Schindler holding a fish with a growth.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0article reported\u00a0that this\u00a0image depicted\u00a0a fish\u00a0\"showing classic signs of radiation-caused cancerous tumors,\" but Schindler said that the\u00a0fish was taken from the Athabasca River watershed, which is downstream from an oil sands industrial development \u2014\u00a0\u00a0not a nuclear plant:\n\nIn addition to spreading misinformation about the effects that the Fukushima disaster had on marine life,\u00a0Superstation95\u00a0attempted to revive a long-debunked rumor that sharks don't get cancer:\nWell, when they swim around the Pacific Ocean nowadays, the radiation is so terrible that even sharks are getting cancer! Recently, researchers in Australia noticed a large tumor protruding from the mouth of a great white shark, as well as another mass on the head of a bronze whaler shark. The tumor on the Great White was a historic first.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe above-displayed image was taken in 2013, and while it was an unusual sight -\u2014\u00a0the first time a tumor was spotted on a great white shark \u2014\u00a0 there is no evidence that the tumor was caused by radiation from Fukushima or anywhere else. \u00a0Rachel Robbins,\u00a0shark biologist at the Fox Shark Research Foundation who studied the animal, said that while the cause of the tumor was unknown, industrial pollutants may have been\u00a0a contributing factor:\nScientists have known for more than 150 years that sharks get cancer. And yet the belief persists that the animals don't suffer from the disease.\nThat misconception is promoted in part by those who sell shark cartilage, who claim that the substance will help cure cancer, said David Shiffman, a shark researcher and doctoral student at the University of Miami. But no studies have shown that shark cartilage is an effective treatment, and the demand for the material has helped decimate shark populations, researchers say.\n[...]\nIn total, scientists have now documented tumors in at least 23 species of sharks, including the two in the new study, Robbins said. \"The main take-home message from the study is that it adds to the growing evidence of tumor formation in sharks, contrary to popular belief that sharks do not suffer from such anomalies,\" Robbins told LiveScience.\n[...]\nIt's unknown what caused the tumors in the great white or bronzer shark. However, reports of cancerous tumors in marine animals, especially mammals, have steadily increased over the past 20 years, raising concerns that industrial pollutants or human activities may trigger the cancers, according to the study. Beluga whales have been recorded to suffer from cancer, and in areas near aluminum smelting plants, cancer is the second leading killer of the whales, the study noted.\n  Another misleading photo used to\u00a0illustrate the effects of nuclear radiation featured a coral trout with skin cancer:\n\nThe web site reports\u00a0that \"the only explanation for a fish getting human-like skin cancer is exposure to radiation.\" While that may be technically true, the researchers who discovered the above-displayed fish told\u00a0Live Science\u00a0that the fish probably got skin cancer due to UV radiation, not nuclear radiation:\nThe first case of skin cancer in a wild marine fish population looks eerily similar to the melanoma that plagues humans, researchers report today.\nCoral trout living on Australia's Great Barrier Reef are directly beneath the Antarctic ozone hole, the world's largest, which is the result of the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere that normally protects humans from harmful UV rays.\n\"Further work needs to be carried out to establish the exact cause of the cancer, but having eliminated other likely factors such as microbial pathogens and marine pollution, UV radiation appears to be the likely cause,\" study researcher Michael Sweet, of Newcastle University in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.\n  The\u00a0following images were presented\u00a0with little to no explanation, although they were, presumably, included in the article in order to imply to\u00a0readers that these animals had all been victims of the Fukushima disaster:\n\nThe above\u00a0photograph of shrimp was taken in 2012 in the Gulf of Mexico, and was lifted from an Al Jazeera story about the effects of the BP oil spill.\n\nThis photo of a starfish was taken in 2006 \u2014\u00a0long before the Fukushima disaster\u00a0\u2014 and appears on a Wikipedia page.\n\nThis\u00a0photo of a\u00a0\"juvenile male Northern Fur Seal\" was taken in 2009\u00a0\u2014 again, before the Fukushima disaster \u2014\u00a0 and has nothing to do with radiation.
