The board has been suggested as a potential source of bonds to help finance a new Milwaukee Bucks arena.", "Since Adamczyk won election in November 2014, he has raised questions about Nelson\u2019s performance and her background as an environmentalist.

Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to co-chair a state global warming task force. During that time she also held her position at the public lands agency. Not long after the global warming report was issued, Nelson traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about climate change at a congressional hearing and discussed the report in other settings.", "Adamczyk has called her task force work theft of the state\u2019s time and also criticized Nelson and La Follette for recently attending a land commissioners\u2019 conference in Phoenix.", "At the April 7 meeting, Nelson defended herself and said she served on the task force at the request of Doyle. She said she hasn't actively worked on global warming since the task force disbanded.", "\"I have never lobbied on climate change on state time in the entire 10 years I've been at the board of commissioners,\" she said.", "After her comments, Adamczyk asked for approval of a resolution to \"prohibit staff from engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time.\" Adamczyk and Schimel voted in favor, La Follette voted no.", "We contacted Nelson and she declined to discuss the board\u2019s action -- or climate change.", "She did note she was going to be on vacation April 22, which is Earth Day, giving a talk about her father at his alma mater, San Jose State University.", "Our rating", "The advocacy group NextGen Climate says Nelson, daughter of the founder of Earth Day, is under orders not to discuss global warming on state time.
