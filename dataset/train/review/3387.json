After all, pasteurization kills the bacteria responsible for diseases including typhoid fever, tuberculosis and diphtheria.", "Still, the lawmakers said in their September 2016 letter to the Texas Department of State Health Services: \"Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in our state in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years.\"", "Do those counts hold up?", "The letter, we determined, failed to account for up to 10 suspected illnesses in 2015 due to drinking raw milk.

Dan Flynn, R-Van, how he reached his conclusion about no illnesses in more than four years and just six in 20 years, an aide, Kelli Linza, emailed us a chart citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The chart included an entry stating the agency confirmed two Texas illnesses, both in February 2000, traced to drinking unpasteurized milk.

Often, by the time someone gets sick and an investigation occurs, the food has been eaten or discarded, so there\u2019s no longer product available to test.", "\"Also, it\u2019s worth noting that only a small percentage of foodborne illnesses are diagnosed and reported, so there may be additional cases out there that we don\u2019t ever find out about,\" Van Deusen wrote.", "We circled back to Flynn about the reported illnesses from 2015. By email, Linza expressed concern that the suspected 2015 instances of illness linked to raw milk that we found didn\u2019t show up in what Flynn fetched from the CDC in July 2016.", "Linza, asked whether Flynn asked State Health Services to tally raw-milk illnesses, said she didn\u2019t remember doing so.

The 30 states where raw milk sales were legal at the end of the study in 2011 included about a dozen states, like Texas, that allowed raw milk sales only on the farm where the milk was produced.", "Then again, a chart with the study says the identified outbreaks occurred in 25 states--with no outbreaks in Texas:", "SOURCE: Study, \"Increased Outbreaks Associated with Nonpasteurized Milk, United States, 2007\u20132012,\" Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, in journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, January 2015 (accessed Sept. 19, 2016)", "We also spotted a nongovernmental website funded by a Washington state law firm that represents food-poisoning victims.
