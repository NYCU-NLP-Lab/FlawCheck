["As he explains his plan on illegal immigration, Trump gets several facts wrong.", "By D'Angelo Gore, Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely", "Posted on August 30, 2016", "Over the past week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has\u00a0twisted the facts on illegal immigration, and the plans of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, as he struggled to explain what he would do with the estimated 11 million people who are living in the U.S. illegally.", "Trump came under criticism\u00a0even from some of his supporters when he appeared to soften his position on deporting all 11 million or so people who are estimated to be living in the U.S. illegally. Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Aug. 24 (at about the 3:40 mark) that \u201ceveryone agrees that we get the bad ones out,\u201d but then he left open the possibility that some who have been living in the U.S. for years without incident would get to stay.", "\u201cThey\u2019ll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes. There\u2019s no amnesty, as such, there\u2019s no amnesty, but we work with them,\u201d Trump told Hannity, contrary to his earlier position that he would have a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to remove all 11 million people. Trump may clear up the confusion in a speech he said he will deliver Aug. 31.", "As he dealt with the deportation issue in recent days, Trump gave several speeches and interviews that touched on the topic of immigration. We review some of his claims here.", "Trump told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper\u00a0in an Aug. 25 interview that \u201cusing the existing laws, millions of people are deported every year.\u201d That\u2019s false, and not even close.", "DHS defines a \u201cremoval\u201d as \u201cthe compulsory and confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States based on an order of removal.\u201d The peak for removals processed by the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies, going back to 1892, was 435,498 in fiscal 2013.", "Trump may have been thinking of a time when the total number of \u201cremovals\u201d and \u201creturns,\u201d together, approached 2 million. That was more than a decade ago, though.", "DHS defines a \u201creturn\u201d as \u201cthe confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States not based on an order of removal.\u201d In other words, a return occurs when an apprehended immigrant leaves the U.S. voluntarily before being ordered to do so through a formal removal proceeding.", "The peak for returns was\u00a0nearly\u00a01.7 million in fiscal 2000, and there were an additional 188,467 removals that year.", "But the last time DHS reported more than\u00a0even 1 million combined removals and returns was fiscal 2008. And DHS conducted a total of just 462,463 removals and returns in fiscal 2015.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a70db3f6-25e9-4730-a26d-af56173f493f", "At a campaign rally in Austin, Trump took a page out of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s playbook and misrepresented Texas crime data on immigrants. Trump claimed the numbers pertained to \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d but they actually pertain to all immigrants, both legal and illegal.", "Trump, Aug. 23:\u00a0According to the Texas government, nearly 200,000\u00a0illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft. Not going to happen folks. We\u2019re not going to let it happen to our country. It\u2019s enough.", "Trump is citing, incorrectly, figures from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which has a webpage on \u201cTexas Criminal Alien Arrest Data.\u201d\u00a0Just as Perry did when he cited such data in\u00a02014,\u00a0Trump says the statistics are about illegal immigrants. But a \u201ccriminal alien,\u201d in the Texas DPS\u2019 wording, is any immigrant who was charged with a crime \u2014 and the webpage, which contains all of the numbers Trump used, makes that clear.", "Also, the \u201cmore than half a million criminal offenses\u201d Trump cites are charges, not convictions, over those immigrants\u2019 lifetimes.", "Trump exaggerates when he says\u00a0that \u201cnearly 200,000 illegal immigrants\u00a0were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016.\u201d Most, but not all, of the immigrants arrested over those years were identified as being illegally in the country.\u00a0As the Texas DPS webpage says: \u201cOf the total criminal aliens arrested in that timeframe, over 130,000 or 66% were identified by [the federal Department of Homeland Security]\u00a0status as being in the US illegally at the time of their last arrest.\u201d", "The Texas Department of Public Safety compiled this data through\u00a0fingerprint submissions to DHS under its \u201cPriority Enforcement Program.\u201d Under PEP, local and state law enforcement submit fingerprints, which\u00a0are screened by the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. DHS says the goal is to \u201ctake custody of individuals who pose a danger to public safety before those individuals are released into our communities.\u201d", "Trump goes on to say that the immigrants arrested between 2011 and 2016 \u201cwere responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses,\u201d including homicides and sexual assaults \u2014 but these are arrests, not convictions. Also, the Texas DPS notes these arrests occurred \u201c[d]uring their criminal careers.\u201d So the number of offenses\u00a0goes beyond the 2011-2016 time frame.", "The DPS doesn\u2019t give a breakdown for the number of those charges\u00a0for illegal and legal immigrants, and DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us that information wasn\u2019t readily available and would require a public information request. We have submitted that request and will update this article if we\u00a0obtain those numbers.", "This means the numbers that Trump gives for homicide, sexual assault and burglary/theft charges don\u2019t all pertain to immigrants living in the country illegally, as he claims.", "These charges or arrests of immigrants\u00a0are more than double the number of convictions. The Texas DPS webpage says that while there have been 526,000 arrests, over the \u201ccriminal careers\u201d of these individuals, there have been \u201cover 236,000 convictions\u201d resulting from those charges. DPS does have a breakdown for how many convictions pertain to immigrants\u00a0in the country\u00a0illegally: 157,000.", "So, the 130,000 individuals arrested between 2011 and 2016 in Texas \u2014 who were identified by fingerprints by the Department of Homeland Security as being illegally present in the country \u2014 were convicted of\u00a0157,000 crimes over their\u00a0lifetimes\u00a0in Texas.", "We also have requested a breakdown on the types of convictions for illegal and legal immigrants. The Texas DPS notes: \u201cTexas arrestees who have not had interaction with the DHS which resulted in the collection of fingerprints are not included as their identity cannot be biometrically verified by DHS.\u201d So there may be more immigrants, of varying legal status, who were arrested in Texas but not included in these figures.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6555ff86-398a-40a6-b990-a57ad95e60a1", "Trump told Cooper that there could be as many as 30 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But immigration experts say that it is impossible for the number to be that high.", "Trump: You know it\u2019s a process. You can\u2019t take 11 million at one time and just say boom, you\u2019re gone. We have to find where these people are. Most people don\u2019t even know \u2014 nobody even knows if it\u2019s 11 [million]. It could be 30 [million] and it could be 5 [million]. Nobody knows what the number is.", "There were 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2012, according to the\u00a0most recent estimate from the Department of Homeland Security. DHS says that \u201cmost unauthorized residents either entered the United States without inspection or were admitted temporarily and stayed past the date they were required to leave.\u201d", "However, the old federal number is in line with more recent estimates from independent immigration groups.", "The Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that studies international migration, estimated that the illegal population was about 10.9 million as of 2014. Similarly, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, based on preliminary figures, estimated that there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. that year.", "Both CMS and Pew, as well as the federal government, estimated the size of the unauthorized population by subtracting the number of legal immigrants in the U.S from the total foreign-born population in the U.S., and then adding the estimated number of foreign-born individuals missed by the Census Bureau\u2019s population survey.", "\u201cSeveral nongovernmental organizations and the federal government, each using their own methodologies to estimate the unauthorized population in the United States and taking into account the fact that there is an undercount of unauthorized immigrants in U.S. Census Bureau data, have developed very similar numbers,\u201d wrote Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications and public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute, in an email to FactCheck.org.", "\u201cSo, we believe that these estimates are largely accurate, even as there are differences of up to a few hundred thousand people among these estimates,\u201d Mittelstadt said.", "Therefore, immigration experts said, it\u2019s not possible that there could be\u00a0as many as 30 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., as Trump suggested.", "\u201cWe believe that our estimates are sound estimates of the population,\u201d said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center.", "In an email, Passel told us that the number of unauthorized immigrants could be \u201ca million or so higher\u201d than 11 million. But, he said, it is \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for that population to be as low as 5 million and \u201csimply no way\u201d that it could be as high as 30 million.", "Passel, Aug. 30: Based on data collected in our surveys, US government surveys and many others, it is virtually impossible for there to be as few as 5 million unauthorized immigrants in the country.", "On the high side, there could be more than 11 million, but it\u2019s extremely unlikely that the number could be more than a million or so higher. We base this assessment on a number of factors including: the number of housing units in the country (there\u2019s simply no place for an additional 20 million folks to live); the population of Mexico and Central America (based on their own censuses and surveys, there could not be another 5+ million people missing); and data on visa admissions & departures (virtually all who arrive are known to depart). There\u2019s simply no way for an additional 20 million people (30 million less the 11 estimated) to be in the country and have escaped detection.", "Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors fewer legal immigration admissions to the U.S., estimated the population of illegal immigrants to be 11.5 million in 2015 and 11.7 million in 2016. That\u2019s in the range of 10 million to 12 million that \u201cmost people believe,\u201d Camarota said in an interview.", "\u201cThere is not good evidence\u201d that the number is a lot higher, he said.", "Robert Warren, a senior visiting fellow with the Center for Migration Studies, agrees.\u00a0In a report explaining the methodology behind the estimate of 11 million unauthorized immigrants, Warren, also a former director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s statistics division, said that \u201cclaims of much higher numbers are not credible.\u201d", "\u201cAlthough the estimate of 11 million unauthorized residents has a range of uncertainty (possibly plus or minus one million), the estimate is firmly supported by the available evidence,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cIt is unlikely that the current population is larger than 11 or 12 million; nearly inconceivable that it is 15 to 20 million; and ludicrous to claim that it could be as high as 30 million.\u201d", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ad6b4d8-7aa6-479d-bc82-8754c5a31084", "In his Iowa speech, Trump criticized several aspects of Clinton\u2019s immigration plan.", "Trump, Aug. 27:\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s legislative plan, remember this, is to give illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, Social Security, Medicare and U.S. welfare. I can see one man that doesn\u2019t like that very\u00a0much. That would not happen here, would it? Her plan would functionally end enforcement of visa overstay rules \u2014 another open border decree. She\u2019ll also close down detention centers for border crossings, meaning she will have an open southern border that will bring nothing but crime and destruction.", "Trump is right that Clinton has proposed \u201cto give illegal immigrants access to Obamacare.\u201d Clinton\u2019s immigration plan says\u00a0that \u201c[w]e should let families \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\u201d\u00a0Her plan does not, however, \u201cgive illegal immigrants access\u201d to\u00a0other government\u00a0programs such as Social Security unless and until they become legal residents, as we have addressed before.", "But what about detention centers and visa overstays?", "Clinton\u2019s plan does not address visa overstays. Her only mention of visas in her plan is a promise to \u201cfix the family visa backlog,\u201d a reference to administrative delays for processing visa applications for spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens, as well as the cap on family visas for other family members, as explained by the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigration advocacy group. As of Nov. 1, 2015, there were 4.5 million family-sponsored visa applicants on the waiting list, according to the State Department. Clinton reiterated her pledge to address the backlog\u00a0in a July speech at the 87th\u00a0League of United Latin American Citizens conference.", "It\u2019s not known how many of the estimated 11.3 million people now living in the U.S. illegally overstayed their visas, but the number is believed to be in the millions. In 2006, the Pew Research Center estimated that there were 11.5 million to 12 million people living illegally in the U.S. at that time, and somewhere between 4 million to 5.5 million of them had overstayed their visas. More recently, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 527,127 individuals overstayed their visas in fiscal year 2015.", "While Clinton\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t specifically address visa overstays, Clinton\u2019s plan does call for comprehensive immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship. That means that some of those who overstayed their visas may be eligible to legally stay in the U.S. It is possible that that is what Trump means when he says her plan \u201cwould functionally end enforcement of visa overstay rules.\u201d We asked the campaign for a clarification, but we did not receive one.", "Even so, Trump overstates his case because the visa overstay rules likely would remain in effect for those not eligible for Clinton\u2019s\u00a0immigration plan or whatever version of it she may be able to enact\u00a0as president. In fact, Clinton endorsed the Senate\u2019s bipartisan immigration bill \u2014 the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 \u2014 that had a provision specific to visa overstays. That bill would have imposed a\u00a0new exit-tracking system of visa holders to reduce visa overstays, and \u201clocate and remove visa overstays identified by the entry-exit system,\u201d as explained in a 2014 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "As for detention centers, Trump exaggerates when he claims that\u00a0Clinton will \u201cclose down detention centers for border crossings, meaning she will have an open southern border that will bring \u2026 crime and destruction.\u201d", "In a Dec. 14, 2015, speech on immigration, Clinton said she would \u201cclose private immigration detention centers.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security tells us that all of them are operated by private contractors, so Clinton\u2019s promise is to close all of them. But in her speech, she also said that operating detention centers is \u201ca critical government responsibility\u201d\u00a0and \u201cwe should not be outsourcing it.\u201d That would mean Clinton is proposing government-run facilities.\u00a0(In fact, the department announced on Aug. 29 that it is looking at closing the private facilities because of their conditions.)", "Clinton, Dec. 14:\u00a0There are people in immigration detention right now who are on a hunger strike. We need to be focused on detention conditions, and as president I\u2019ll close private immigration detention centers. This is a critical government responsibility and we should not be outsourcing it to anyone else. I\u2019ll also end family detention, we have good alternatives and we should use them.", "While Clinton is not getting rid of all detention centers, as implied by Trump, she may need fewer detention centers since she promises to \u201cend family detention\u201d centers and use alternatives. The Clinton campaign did not respond when we asked what alternatives she is proposing. But the Department of Homeland Security has an existing Alternative to Detention program for low-risk detainees that includes\u00a0electronic monitoring, curfew and home visits.", "Families are already a relatively small portion of the overall immigration detainee population.", "As of Aug. 8, there was a nationwide average daily population of 33,676 in detention centers, according to a spokeswoman for U.S.\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u00a0Prior to 2014, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, had only 95 of its 34,000 beds available for families, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a speech at Rice University\u00a0on June 8, 2015. But Johnson said the surge of immigrants from Central America required the department to build more capacity. As a result, the department opened a 532-bed facility for families in Karnes, Texas, and a 2,400-bed facility in Dilley, Texas.", "So Clinton\u2019s promise to\u00a0\u201cend family detention\u201d will have a limited impact on the overall detainee population, while her promise to \u201cclose private immigration detention centers\u201d would result in a switch to government-run facilities. It does not mean that Clinton \u201cwill have an open southern border,\u201d as Trump claimed.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8620c95d-536d-4f38-90f1-49d4b81bb5ca", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1e8f6828-e4a2-40e0-9701-58f40a89fa81", "New Jersey Gov.

Clinton says she\u2019ll propose \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d within her first 100 days in office that will include \u201d a pathway to full and equal citizenship.\u201d But that pathway won\u2019t be available to everyone. Clinton\u2019s website goes on to say: \u201cHillary will focus resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety.\u201d", "Clinton has talked about deporting \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cdangerous\u201d criminals in other instances, such as during a March Democratic debate and in a December 2015 speech to the National Immigrant\u00a0Integration Conference. And the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration bill she supported also barred\u00a0those convicted of a felony, three misdemeanor crimes (not counting \u201cminor traffic offenses\u201d), a foreign crime or unlawful voting from the years-long path to citizenship the legislation would have established for immigrants living in the country illegally.
