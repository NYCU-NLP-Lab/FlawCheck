["About this rating", "On Nov. 12, 2020, journalists on Twitter noticed an unusual development in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Twitter account: It had ceased to exist. We went onto the account and found it appeared to have been removed for a few hours.", "The agency offered no immediate reason for this, though many online wondered why:", "To confirm that ICE\u2019s official account was no longer on Twitter, we went to the agency's website and saw that its link to Twitter was still available. After clicking on the link at the bottom of the agency's homepage, we were directed back to the disappeared account page.", "Based on online archives, the Twitter account was active on Nov. 11, 2020. ICE\u2019s Facebook page was also online and functional on Nov. 12, 2020. A reporter for NBC News found that ICE had changed its own birthdate for the account \u2014 making the agency less than 13 years old \u2014 which was interpreted as violating Twitter's terms of service requiring people must be at least 13 years old:", "A few hours after we first checked, the account had returned to its fully functional state. ICE also tweeted out an update:", "We reached out to ICE, and will update this post if we receive more information.", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
