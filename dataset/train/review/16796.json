We came across a compilation article by Patrika listing recent mob attacks in Madhya Pradesh sparked by child-kidnapping rumours. One among them was described similar to the incident depicted in the video. According to the report, an inebriated woman had mistakenly entered a person\u2019s house in Bareli [Raisen district] on the night of July 19. Falsely suspecting her to be a child-kidnapper, a mob beat her up. The woman was later admitted to a hospital after the police intervened.", "The incident was also reported by Dainik Bhaskar.", "Alt News contacted Bareli police to corroborate the set of event. We sent the video to the area police inspector who confirmed that it depicts the same incident. \u201cThe woman was heavily intoxicated and was already getting treated in a hospital. After a minor scuffle with the hospital staff, she fled the place and the police was later informed that she was found by a mob that suspected her of being a child-kidnapper. The police rescued her and put her back in the hospital. She was later united with her family,\u201d the PI informed.", "A video of a drunk woman falsely accused of being a child-kidnapper is floating on social media to fuel false rumours. The same narrative \u2013 Rohingya Muslims are on a prowl to abduct children \u2013 has also been used to promote similar rumours. Alt News recently debunked a video where a mentally-challenged man was thrashed and interrogated by a mob in Raisen, MP. A photograph of a sex racket gang arrested by MP police was also floating as Rohingya Muslim child-kidnappers.
