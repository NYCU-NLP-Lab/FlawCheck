["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on July 6, 2016", "A Republican congressman falsely claimed there are \u201cthousands of studies\u201d that refute the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s conclusion that ground-level ozone, a component of smog, exacerbates asthma attacks. A relationship between ground-level ozone and asthma exacerbation is well-documented in the scientific literature.", "In fact, the congressman\u2019s office wasn\u2019t able to provide us with any studies that refute the link between ozone and asthma, and one of the studies that it sent us noted, \u201cOzone exposure has been associated with \u2026 asthma exacerbation.\u201d The American Lung Association and the World Health Organization also state that ozone pollution is a health threat to asthmatics.", "Louisiana Rep. Ralph Abraham made the claim at a June 22 House Science Committee hearing called \u201cEnsuring Sound Science at the EPA.\u201d He and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy discussed the agency\u2019s 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone.", "In 2015,\u00a0the EPA lowered its 2008 ground-level ozone standard of 75 parts per billion to 70 ppb averaged over eight hours.\u00a0The EPA says\u00a0it will work with states to help them develop plans that comply with the new standard by 2025. It also states that\u00a0areas requiring more work will\u00a0get more time to comply.", "Ground-level ozone is a component of photochemical smog, which is produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Gasoline, paint and cleaning products can emit VOCs. Nitrogen oxides reach the atmosphere through car exhaust, coal power plants and other sources.", "Ground-level ozone can be harmful to\u00a0humans,\u00a0wildlife\u00a0and\u00a0plants.\u00a0Ground-level ozone shouldn\u2019t be confused with the ozone layer, which\u00a0protects\u00a0the Earth\u2019s inhabitants from ultraviolet radiation. The ozone layer is located between 6\u00a0to 30 miles above the planet\u2019s surface.", "Asthma is a complex disease with many causes and triggers, including\u00a0indoor lung irritants like mold, outdoor pollution like ozone and genetic factors. Scientists haven\u2019t definitively teased apart which factor plays the largest role because \u201casthma\u201d is an umbrella term for\u00a0a set of respiratory symptoms that often have different causes and triggers in different individuals.", "In its 2013 integrated scientific assessment, which supported its 2015 ozone rule, the EPA considered the negative impacts ozone can have on both human health and the environment. Abraham primarily criticized the EPA\u2019s \u201cscientific basis\u201d for claiming that ground-level ozone plays a role in\u00a0asthma. In doing so, he said\u00a0the EPA\u2019s scientific analysis for ozone in general was incomplete because it\u00a0didn\u2019t take into consideration studies that looked at other factors linked to\u00a0asthma, like indoor air pollution.", "But as McCarthy explained during the hearing, the studies the EPA did look at would have determined \u201cwhether or not outside ozone levels contributed to additional attacks or hospital visits\u201d on top of health effects\u00a0brought about by other factors like indoor air pollutants. An expert in the field also confirmed this fact by email to us.", "McCarthy and Abraham often talked past each other during the hearing. In the next sections, we\u2019ll pick apart their exchange and explain the science behind ozone\u2019s negative impact on asthmatics.", "Abraham conflated evidence for the causes and exacerbators of asthma during the June 22 hearing and previous hearings. In the process, he falsely claimed there are \u201cthousands of studies\u201d that \u201cwould refute\u201d the \u201cscientific basis\u201d of the EPA\u2019s conclusion that ozone exacerbates asthma.", "Kent Pinkerton, an air quality and health expert at the University of California, Davis, told us by email that a cause is a factor that\u2019s linked to the initial development of the disease, i.e. the prevalence of people with asthma. But an exacerbator, or trigger, brings about asthma attacks, he said.", "On June 22, Abraham began questioning McCarthy by referencing a July 9, 2015, hearing called \u201cExamining the EPA\u2019s Regulatory Overreach.\u201d He said, \u201cOn one of your previous appearances you testified that ozone exacerbates asthma,\u201d which McCarthy confirmed.", "Abraham added, \u201cyet you went on to specifically state \u2026 that \u2018the scientists actually have not made any connection between the levels of ozone and the prevalence of asthma.\u2019\u201d In other words, he implied McCarthy\u2019s comments were in conflict \u2013 but they\u2019re not.", "Abraham then asked McCarthy if she\u2019s familiar with other factors that can exacerbate asthma. She replied, \u201cMold and dust can certainly be triggers for asthma attacks,\u201d among other things.", "The two went on to talk past each other while discussing ozone and asthma.", "Abraham, June 22:\u00a0Ozone levels have decreased dramatically over the last three decades yet asthma has gone up. And after all these years, you nor your advisors have never really managed to connect those dots and look into the indoor air pollution aspect of it.", "McCarthy: So you just indicated how many factors go into asthma attacks.\u00a0The\u00a0point I\u2019m making is that it seems very clear from the science that outdoor ozone levels cause problems for kids who have asthma.", "When Abraham refers to the fact that ozone levels have decreased nationally (which is true for 1980 to 2014), but asthma rates have increased (which is true for 2001 to 2010), he\u2019s linking the prevalence of asthmatics with ozone levels. That is, he\u2019s referring to ozone as a cause of asthma development. Yet, McCarthy goes on to argue that ozone is an exacerbator of asthma attacks.", "This crossfire continued with a debate over whether there\u2019s scientific evidence to support a link between asthma exacerbation and ozone.", "Abraham: How can the EPA\u2019s analysis \u2014 how can you say it\u2019s complete if \u2026 your advisors have \u2026\u00a0failed to understand the importance of indoor air pollution on these poor children?", "McCarthy: Because their reports to me looked at thousands of studies that actually did factor in different considerations that concluded based on the weight of evidence that ozone contributes to exacerbating asthma attacks. \u2026", "Abraham: I\u2019ve seen thousands of studies also that would refute your scientific basis \u2026 I think it\u2019s flawed and I think we can refute it on every level.", "During the July 9, 2015,\u00a0hearing, McCarthy and Abraham had a similar exchange.", "Abraham, July 9, 2015: And if you look at the slide, Ms. McCarthy, you see that asthma rates have dramatically increased, and this is despite decreasing ozone. So I guess I would ask for your comment on that.", "McCarthy: Well, I don\u2019t think that the scientists at this point are saying that asthma is caused by ozone.", "Abraham: No, I agree.", "McCarthy: The issue is that it\u2019s exacerbated.", "Abraham: Well, but objective data cannot prove that \u2026 I\u2019ve got a chart here that shows \u2014 that begs to differ.", "Here again, Abraham conflates ozone as a cause of asthma and ozone as a trigger for asthma attacks when he cites increased asthma rates and decreased ozone levels.", "Pinkerton told us decreased ozone levels combined with increased asthma rates isn\u2019t evidence for discord between asthma and ozone, as Abraham claimed. \u201cDespite these improvements in air quality, ground level ozone still has the potential to cause or exacerbate asthma,\u201d Pinkerton said.", "Scientists have definitive evidence to link ground-level ozone and the exacerbation of asthma, and\u00a0some evidence to\u00a0support a link between ozone and the development of the disease in the first place.", "As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, \u201cIn most cases, we don\u2019t know what causes asthma.\u201d And triggers for asthma attacks differ widely by individual, says the CDC. In other words, asthma is a complex disease that\u2019s rarely caused or triggered by one factor alone.", "However, Pinkerton pointed us to a 2002 Lancet study, which the EPA also cited in its 2013 assessment, that did provide some evidence for a causal link between asthma development and increased ozone levels in concert with exercise.", "Rob McConnell, an asthma expert at the University of Southern California, and others found that \u201cplaying multiple team sports in a high ozone environment is associated with development of physician-diagnosed asthma.\u201d The authors added, \u201cExercise-induced asthma by itself is unlikely to have been an explanation for these results, because asthma onset was associated with exercise only in polluted communities.\u201d", "McConnell and his co-authors\u00a0also state, \u201cAcute exposure to ozone and other outdoor air pollutants exacerbates asthma.\u201d The authors cite a review paper from 1995 to support this.", "That 1995 paper, published in Environmental Health Perspectives by H.S. Koren, then an EPA scientist, states that clear evidence linking ozone with irritative cough, chest pain, decreased lung capacity and other related cellular effects had already began\u00a0mounting since at least 1980. These symptoms all fall under the \u201casthma\u201d umbrella.", "The EPA also cites a 2010 study, published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, which\u00a0showed increased ozone levels are more likely to send children with asthma to the hospital than adults.", "A\u00a02009 study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\u00a0found that inhalation of 70 ppb of ozone for 6.6 hours is sufficient to decrease the FEV1 of healthy young adults. The EPA\u2019s current standard for ozone\u00a0is\u00a070 ppb averaged over eight hours. The FEV1 is the amount of air people can forcefully blow out of their lungs in one second.", "Other studies found the same effect at 60 ppb. The EPA cites many more studies to make a case for its 2015 NAAQS for Ozone, specifically ozone\u2019s impact on human health.", "We asked Cole Avery, Abraham\u2019s communications director, to point us to papers that support the congressman\u2019s claim that \u201cthousands of studies\u201d refute the link between ozone and asthma exacerbation.", "He told us, \u201cDr. Abraham was referring to the many studies that show that indoor air pollution exacerbates asthma, and should be given just as much consideration as ambient air pollution.\u201d As Abraham\u00a0noted during the hearing, he\u00a0was previously a medical doctor.", "Avery also cited five papers that\u00a0primarily looked at indoor air pollution as a cause of the disease, not an exacerbator of asthma attacks. That is, they looked at the morbidity or prevalence of people with asthma as it relates to levels of indoor air pollutants like mold or cockroach allergens.", "Similar to\u00a0Abraham\u2019s claim, one paper\u00a0Avery cited, published in Environmental Health Perspectives in 2002, noted that concentrations of many air pollutants have declined in urban areas and\u00a0the prevalence of asthmatics has increased. But the paper\u00a0added, \u201cThis suggests that these air pollutants are not the cause, or only cause, of asthma, although this does not preclude their role in asthma exacerbation.\u201d", "Thus, it\u2019s important to distinguish between indoor and ambient (outdoor) air pollution levels as either causes\u00a0or\u00a0exacerbators of asthma. Research that\u00a0shows\u00a0indoor air pollutants cause asthma doesn\u2019t disprove research that\u00a0links ozone, an outdoor pollutant, and asthma exacerbation.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Abraham is not alone in misleadingly citing other factors involved in asthma as support for the idea that ozone plays little to no role in the disease.", "The Institute for Energy Research, a conservative nonprofit organization, said last year that a 2015\u00a0study linking asthma with race and income called \u201cinto question EPA\u2019s longstanding belief that people, particularly children, who are exposed to more outdoor air pollution, such as ozone, are at a greater risk for developing asthma.\u201d The Heartland Institute, also a conservative organization, has made similar claims about this same study.", "But the\u00a0study\u2019s lead author, Corinne Keet at John Hopkins University, told\u00a0Greenwire, one of\u00a0Environment & Energy Publishing\u2018s\u00a0online news outlets, that \u201csuch arguments are a \u2018distortion\u2019 of her research team\u2019s findings.\u201d", "Published in\u00a0The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,\u00a0Keet and her co-authors\u2019 study\u00a0found\u00a0that while the \u201cprevalence of asthma is high in some inner-city areas, this is largely explained by demographic factors and not by living in an urban neighborhood.\u201d Demographic factors included race and income.", "Greenwire\u00a0also reported that Keet, an expert in pediatric allergic disease, sent a letter to EPA Administrator McCarthy last year \u201cto set the record straight\u201d about her research.", "\u201cIn her letter, she noted that the study did not examine air pollution and that living in an urban area should not be taken as a surrogate for high exposures to pollution,\u201d said Greenwire.\u00a0Keet specifically\u00a0wrote\u00a0that her study\u2019s finding had been \u201cmisinterpreted by some who believe that it suggests that air pollution in general, and ozone in particular, is not important for asthma.\u201d She\u00a0added, \u201cThis is an erroneous conclusion.\u201d", "Abraham wasn\u2019t wrong when he said that indoor pollutants\u00a0negatively impact asthmatics. But that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that ozone also plays a role in the condition.\u00a0In fact, there\u2019s plenty\u00a0of research linking ozone with asthma exacerbation, and there\u2019s some evidence to support the idea that ozone can contribute to development of\u00a0the disease as well.", "Editor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc945ea5-805c-400b-857f-b07769796f35", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
