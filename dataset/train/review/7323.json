In particular, Iran, a perennial threat to stability in the region.\n\n\"When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran,\" Biden said. \"We were the problem.\"\n\nSome conservatives, who accuse the Obama administration of being apologists for America, responded quickly to Biden\u2019s line that \"we were the problem\" -- an apparent shot at George W. Bush\u2019s administration. One writer for the right-leaning National Review wrote an article arguing the vice president was wrong about the lack of international pressure on Iran prior to Democrat Barack Obama becoming president in 2009.\n\n\"[T]hroughout President Bush\u2019s final year in office, diplomatic efforts generated new levels of pressure on Tehran,\" the Review article reported, referring to the Iranian capital.\n\nSo who\u2019s right here?\n\nBush, a Republican, was worried about Iran, but his attention in the Middle East was primarily focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, countries where he ordered U.S. troops in military conflict. Obama has made ending combat in Afghanistan and Iraq among his top policies in the region. He\u2019s also turned up the heat on Iran, which is said to be on the verge of developing nuclear weapons.\n\nSince 2010, the United States and most of the world\u2019s leading powers have approved several sanctions on Iran. Economic data on Iran is difficult to find, but there is consensus that United Nations sanctions and other forms of punishment are making an impact. The international pressure on Iran includes:", "According to U.S. Treasury and State Department officials, at least 80 major banks had committed not to finance exports to Iran or to process dollar transactions for Iranian banks. China and Russia, world powers who sometimes stray from the U.S.A.\u2019s international game plan, have participated in varying degrees on pressuring Iran.\n\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in late 2011 before Parliament that the current sanctions campaign was \"the heaviest economic onslaught on a nation in history.\"\n\nOkay, it appears the world is making life more difficult for the Iranian regime in the last two years. But what about Biden\u2019s argument that the international community wasn\u2019t as tough on Tehran before Obama took office.\n\nKyle Beardsley, an Emory University assistant professor with vast expertise on such matters, pointed out that as the National Review said, there were several United Nations resolutions against Iran during the latter years of the Bush administration.\n\nThe U.N. efforts during the Bush years included:", "He did add that the Obama administration has tried to apply more pressure on Iran because there is greater willingness on the part of Europe and other key states to implement tougher sanctions.\n\n\"It is true that multiple Security Council resolutions were passed during the Bush administration, but they only targeted specific individuals and companies involved in the Iranian nuclear program,\" Beardsley, whose research includes the influence of U.N. Security Council resolutions, told us via email. \"In contrast, U.N. Resolution 1929 (2010) imposes more general sanctions on Iranian arms, and the E.U. decided this year to impose an embargo on Iranian oil. A number of other countries have also increased their own bilateral sanctions against Iran in recent years.\"\n\nBiden would have had a strong case for high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he said what appeared to be his main point: the Obama administration has prodded the rest of the world to be tougher on Iran. But there is a disconnect with what the vice president actually said and U.N. resolutions passed against Iran during the Bush administration. The resolutions seem to be a little more than \"virtually no international pressure on Iran.\"\u00a0 We rate Biden\u2019s statement False.", "Politico, \"Joe Biden delivers defense of Obama and Israel,\" May 8, 2012.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Biden vows support for Israel in Atlanta visit,\" May 8, 2012.\n\nCenter for Strategic & International Studies report on U.S. and Iranian competition, March 2012.\n\nEmail from Emory University assistant professor Kyle Beardsley, May 9, 2012.\n\nUnited Nations press release on implementation of sanctions against Iran, Sept. 11, 2008.\n\nUnited Nations press release on Resolution 1747, March 24, 2007.\n\nUnited Nations press release on Resolution 1929, June 9, 2010.", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
