Covering his speech, NDTV had put out a tweet at 12:16 PM quoting the PM \u2013 \u201cOver 1250 crore houses have been set up. People have celebrated Diwali in their new homes. The houses we make will have water, electricity, gas connections and toilets.\u201d The media organisation, however, made a faux-pas vis-a-vis the number of houses PM Modi claimed his government built.", "If one carefully listens to his speech, PM Modi says at 19:42 minutes \u2013 \u201c\u0905\u092c \u0924\u0915 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0935\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094b\u095c \u0938\u0947 \u095b\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0918\u0930\u094b \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e \u091a\u0942\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948 (Till now more 1.25 crore houses have been constructed.)\u201d", "At 2:08 PM, NDTV corrected the number \u2013 \u201cOver 1.25 crore houses have been constructed.

The houses we make will have water, electricity, gas connections and toilets.\u201d", "While NDTV\u2019s earlier tweet attracted 162 retweets, the updated tweet was retweeted only 20 times. The news outlet made the change to 1,250 houses without deleting its earlier tweet, which gave many the opportunity to share it while criticising the PM for claiming that BJP built 1,250 crore houses when the country\u2019s population is only 125 crore.", "The official Twitter handle of Account of INC SC department quoted NDTV\u2019s tweet and wrote \u2013 \u201c1250 Crore houses for india? 10 houses for each indian? Even after defeat in 5 states, It seems Modi Ji has not learned any lesson and still doing Jumlebaazi.\u201d It is to be noted that AICC SC\u2019s tweet came before NDTV tweeted PM Modi\u2019s correct statement.", "Mumbai Congress Committee President Sanjay Nirupam also made similar claims while quoting a tweet by BJP MP Smriti Irani where she criticised Congress President Rahul Gandhi for consulting party members before speaking with the media.

Both of them had tweeted before NDTV\u2019s second tweet.", "Several other AICC members (1, 2, 3) also made similar claims.", "Due to NDTV\u2019s incorrect attribution of a statement to PM Modi, he came in the crosshairs of Congress members who quoted the media outlet\u2019s tweet.", "Donate Now", "Pooja Chaudhuri is a senior editor at Alt News.", "A video showing three women tackling several men who were apparently trying to harass them\u2026", "On November 15, Israeli forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip as part\u2026", "Trigger Warning: Graphic Image Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a collage of two pictures is\u2026", "A video of a Palestinian woman allegedly saying that she \u2018prefers the Jews\u2019 in Arabic\u2026", "A 13-second clip from Gaza is viral on social media where a seemingly injured man\u2026"]
