The light waves kill bacteria and viruses by disrupting their DNA.", "But applying UVC light directly to the body would damage genetic material and cause burns within seconds, experts told PolitiFact. Physicians do sometimes use UVA or UVB light to treat skin lymphoma, but they avoid giving patients too much, as it could increase their chances of developing skin cancer later in life.", "\"There is a modified version of this in which a drug can be injected ahead of time to increase cell sensitivity to externally applied UV, but in general it\u2019s not possible to inject UV light itself,\" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, an associate research scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Infection and Immunity, in an email.", "Health care providers also sometimes treat donated blood or plasma with radiation before performing infusions to prevent certain diseases, but most American blood banks use gamma rays or x-rays.
