Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand.", "More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand the following weekend to show their opposition to Trump\u2019s criticism. Both the Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans chose not to stand on the field for the national anthem during their Sept. 24 game in Nashville (all but one member of the Pittsburgh Steelers chose not stand on the sideline for the song, either).", "But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day.", "Looking at the photo more closely, it\u2019s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn\u2019t appear to be giving off smoke.", "The real proof that the image is fake is that it is actually close to two years old, at least. It appeared in a tweet from the Seahawks on Jan. 3, 2016, and is credited to Rob Mar on the team\u2019s website.", "What do you do in the victory locker room?

This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing.
