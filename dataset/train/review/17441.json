["A claim\u00a0made in 2019 by game show host Chuck Woolery regarding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and her purported spending on alcohol during\u00a0flights has resurfaced in a viral March 9 Facebook posting.", "\"Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her flights from Washington to San Fran every week? We pay for it,\" \u00a0the post reads, accompanied by an image of Pelosi, D-Calif. \"1000 dollars. On average 52,000 a year for booze. Tax payer money. Thank you very much.\"", "\"Shouldn't be from our dime, actually our many dollars !\" the user captioned the post, which has over 800\u00a0shares.", "The meme attributes the information to Woolery, who originally shared the claim in a Jan. 17, 2019,\u00a0tweet that has over 17,000 retweets and 28,000 likes. Woolery\u00a0has also previously promoted false claims about the coronavirus pandemic.", "Another user shared a similar version of the claim on Feb. 25\u00a0with text that reads, \"Well, that's comforting, knowing this is our 3rd in command. Soon to be second more than likely, but just a mean drunk in reality.\"", "The Facebook users and Woolery have not returned USA TODAY's request for\u00a0comment.", "Fact check:\u00a0Pelosi doesn't oversee U.S. Capitol security", "There is no evidence to support the claim that Pelosi spends $52,000 per year on alcohol and that it is covered by taxpayer money. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff Drew Hamill\u00a0has previously confirmed to USA TODAY that the House speaker does not drink alcohol.", "It is also false to claim that Pelosi travels to her home state of California every weekend on military aircraft. In March 2020, Hamill told PolitiFact that Pelosi had access to\u00a0a 12-seat Gulfstream jet from 2007 to 2011, during her first stint as speaker, but routinely started flying commercial after that.", "In July 2019, she was seen flying commercial on a crowded Delta flight sitting in coach\u00a0in an image captured by CNN national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny.", "Pelosi has long been the target of misinformation in the form of altered images, which\u00a0have been repeatedly debunked by fact-checking organizations,\u00a0that are designed to make her appear drunk.", "Fact check: False claim that Pelosi travels weekly on 200-seat Boeing airplane", "When asked in 2019\u00a0for evidence\u00a0of the claim that Pelosi spends $52,000 a year on alcohol while flying, a spokesman for Woolery provided PolitiFact with a set of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch,\u00a0which describes itself as a\u00a0right-leaning government watchdog.", "Judicial Watch wrote in a news release in 2010 that findings showed Pelosi's military travel cost the U.S. Air Force a little over $2 million over a two-year period and that $101,429.14\u00a0accounted for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol.", "However, according to Factcheck.org, that figure includes expenses other than food and booze, although congressional delegations do routinely show receipts for expensive alcohol brands such as Grey Goose and Bombay Sapphire.", "Factcheck.org reported in 2010\u00a0that Judicial Watch was counting \"in-flight expenses\" as any non-reimbursable Air Force expenditures other than transportation costs, which includes all non-plane-related charges\u00a0such as baggage fees, meeting room rentals, refreshments, lodging in U.S. territory, and ground transportation.", "Fact check:Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's net worth is not close to $1 million", "The claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her weekly flights from California to Washington costs $52,000 a year and is covered by taxpayers is FALSE, based on our research. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff has previously confirmed that she does not drink alcohol, and claims that she drinks have been repeatedly debunked. The claim stems from a\u00a0report from Judicial Watch\u00a0that included non-plane-related charges as part of \"in-flight expenses.\" Pelosi also no longer flies private and has been publicly seen flying commercial.", "Thank you for supporting our journalism.
