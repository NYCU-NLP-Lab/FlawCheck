Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, recently hinted that changing demographics give him a leg up in his campaign to unseat the African American Democrat.", "Saying he has a \u201csecret weapon,\u201d the semi-retired accountant told delegates to the Republican state convention June 12 that his foe's district has been \u201cgentrified\u201d and has \u201cmore Anglos than African Americans.\u201d", "Really?", "Jackson Lee represents the 18th congressional district, which takes in center-city Houston and a partial ring of outlying neighborhoods.", "To our initial inquiry, Faulk cited the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey for 2008, posted online, which says about 42 percent of the district\u2019s residents that year were white and 38 percent were black. The bureau\u2019s chart doesn\u2019t use the Anglo descriptive Faulk employed at the convention.", "Following Faulk\u2019s lead, we looked into the district\u2019s past racial mix. In 2000, according to that year's census, the district was home then to 263,371 residents identified as black and 240,745 residents recorded as white.", "So from 2000 to 2008, it looks like there was a swing toward more white than black residents.", "Enough said? Maybe not.", "Jackson Lee\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond. But Ed Martin, an Austin Democratic consultant, pointed out that according to the '08 census survey, 41.5 percent of the district\u2019s residents were Hispanic, a reflection, Martin nudged, on the estimate of white residents including many Hispanic residents. That is, the three largest population groups broke down to 38 percent black, 26 percent Hispanic white and 16 percent non-Hispanic white.", "\u201cAfrican American voters control the district,\u201d Martin said.", "Could Faulk\u2019s sense of district demographics reflect recent election surprises? It looks like Democrats continue to dominate. In 2002, the first statewide election after the district was redrawn based on 2000 census results, all but one Democrat running statewide drew more than 72 percent of the district\u2019s vote, according to the Texas Legislative Council. In 2008, the most recent statewide election, Democratic candidates -- from the president down the ballot to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals -- drew 75 percent or more of the vote.", "Next, we asked Lloyd Potter, the state demographer and director of the Institute for Demograhic and Socioeconomic Research at the University of Texas-San Antonio, to weigh the population analyses by Faulk and Martin.", "Potter said both are correct.", "Come again?", "Potter said that white-versus-black is just one way to gauge a population's makeup. At his suggestion, we delved into the bureau\u2019s '08 estimates for the district by clicking on a \u201cshow more\u201d hyperlink leading more information about the district's Hispanics. Six in 10 are identified as white; a relatively small percentage are of multiracial heritage such as black or Native-American. Add non-Hispanic whites to Hispanic whites, and the estimated white total (285,634) outnumbers blacks by 12 percent. But remove Hispanic whites from the white total, and the 255,856 black non-Hispanics outnumber the 109,461 white non-Hispanics by 135 percent.", "Faulk didn\u2019t respond to our efforts to visit afresh; we don\u2019t know if he shook the numbers this way.", "We asked Potter if any voter analysis of a congressional district would be expected to weigh the district\u2019s share of Hispanic residents. Sure, he replied -- especially in Texas, where the growing share of Latinos can affect elections.", "And while Potter said it\u2019s still correct to say the overall share of white residents exceeded the share of black residents according to the 2008 census estimate, he added that \u201csome people might be misled . . .because they don\u2019t understand that (the estimate of) whites includes Hispanics.\u201d", "We\u2019d wager it\u2019s safe to lump most Texans (including us, until now) in that camp.", "Finally, we probed Faulk\u2019s statement the district has undergone gentrification, which according to Merriam-Webster\u2019s online dictionary means \u201crenewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents.\u201d For the 18th district, we presumed, such an influx would be accompanied by significant increases in income over the decade.", "There\u2019s been no surge, census research suggests. The 2000 census concluded the district\u2019s median household income was $31,291 in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, that amount would have been about $40,000 in 2008. But the 2008 census survey pegged the district\u2019s median household income for that year at $37,133--effectively less than what it had been nine years earlier. In 1999, about 20 percent of district families lived below the federal poverty level, according to the 2000 census. In 2008, 21 percent of families lived below that level, according to the 2008 census survey.", "All told, Faulk quoted a portion of the '08 census survey that could lead someone to conclude the district's whites outnumber blacks, signaling a boon for any GOP candidate given that minority voters usually favor Democrats. But that conclusion overlooks the fact that Hispanics -- who are also minority voters -- comprise the majority of white residents.", "Also, the census data yielded no evidence, such as higher incomes, of significant gentrification.", "Faulk's statement is False.", "E-mail and interview, John Faulk, Republican nominee, U.S. House, Houston, June 18, 2010", "E-mail, response to PolitiFact Texas, Ed Martin, Democratic consultant, June 21, 2010", "The Inflation Calculator, accessed June 28, 2010", "Merriam-Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary, gentrification definition, accessed June 28, 2010", "Interview and e-mail, Lloyd Potter, state demographer, University of Texas-San Antonio, June 22 and 23, 2010", "Texas Legislative Council, statewide election results, 18th congressional district, November 2002 and statewide election results, 18th congressional district, November 2008", "U.S. Census Bureau, 2006-2008 American Community Survey, \u201cFast Facts for Congress, 18th Congressional District, Texas,\u201d \u00a0and more detailed demographics by race and ethnicity and detailed tables, 2000 U.S. Census, 18th congressional district of Texas, and \u201cProfile of Selected Economic Characteristics, 18th Congressional District, Texas,\u201d 2000 U.S. Census, accessed June 21 and 28, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
