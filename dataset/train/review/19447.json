["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "If you lose your job and it\u2019s not your fault -- you didn\u2019t steal, sell trade secrets or tell rude \u00a0customers what they could do with that hideous tie they want to return the hellish day after Christmas -- you can usually get unemployment benefits. Here\u2019s how it works: The state of Ohio will help you out for 26 weeks. Then a federal program kicks in to cover 20 more weeks during times of high unemployment.\n\nBut in the recessionary doldrums of the last two years, Congress has given even more help -- up to 53 weeks more. That makes all these jobless benefits add up to 99 weeks.\n\nThe latest congressional extension, though, expired on Nov. 30, and Congress hasn\u2019t decided whether to grant another one.\n\nThe money would have to come from the federal Treasury, which already borrows money to keep the government operating, and that\u2019s the biggest hangup. Some lawmakers say they don\u2019t want to keep adding to the deficit, so they\u2019re insisting on offsets from other domestic programs.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is not in that camp, however. He says that people who get unemployment compensation tend to spend it right away on groceries or rent, so it has a stimulative effect. Many, but not all, economists agree. Regardless, Brown says that Congress needs to show some compassion, because so many Americans are struggling to find work.\n\n\"Understand, this is unemployment insurance,\" Brown told MSNBC anchor Contessa Brewer on Nov. 30. \"It\u2019s not welfare, as a lot of my Republican colleagues like to suggest it is. You pay into it when you\u2019re working. You get help when you\u2019re not.\"\n\nBrown raises several points that we thought were worth checking. The key point: Do workers pay into the unemployment system and then draw benefits from it if they lose their jobs?\n\nThe unemployment system is a bit more complex than that. Workers don\u2019t pay into the system. But their employers do, up to a point.\n\nIn Ohio, private employers pay anywhere from 0.5 percent to 9.4 percent of the first $9,000 of workers\u2019 wages into the state uninsurance fund, according to the state\u2019s Department of Job and Family Services. A company\u2019s payroll size, its total contributions and its claims experience account for the variation. Generally, companies that lay off a lot of people have higher unemployment taxes.\n\nThere also is a federal unemployment compensation fee, but it comes to only 0.8 percent.\n\nBack to Brown\u2019s claim: \"You pay into it when you\u2019re working.\" As just mentioned, it\u2019s actually the employer who pays into it.\n\nBrown and his communications director said he is fully aware of this, but that employers regard their premiums as part of the cost of compensation, so in a figurative manner he was saying the same thing. Brown made that point again Dec. 1 in a conference call with reporters to discuss an unrelated matter and we asked him about paying for \u00a0unemployment compensation.\n\nWe checked with economists at the socially liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Regardless both agreed Brown is essentially right.\n\n\"That\u2019s a cost of hiring workers, and that\u2019s a reduction in the amount of money that they\u2019re willing to pay in wages,\" said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nJames Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at Heritage, said that economists believe 85 percent of the cost of these taxes on employers would otherwise fall back to the employees.\n\nOK, so the employee pays the taxes indirectly. But that only covers the state portion of jobless benefits, or 26 weeks. Everything after that is coming from the federal government. \"It\u2019s mostly deficit financing at this point,\" said Sherk.\n\nMoney from that first 20-week extension would ordinarily be split between the state and federal governments, but the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- better known as the stimulus act -- picked up the state\u2019s portion.\n\nOne more component of Brown\u2019s claim: that \"a lot of my Republican colleagues\" like to suggest that unemployment insurance is like welfare. This was an important part of the claim because it explains why he felt the need to clarify how the system is funded -- not by freeloaders but by workers who pay into the system. So we asked Brown\u2019s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, to back up this part of the claim, too.\n\nShe sent us news stories and links to transcripts, newscasts and news releases in which lawmakers or candidates said that unemployment payments can encourage people to stay jobless (Senate candidate Sharon Angle, Sen.-elect Ron Johnson, Sen. Richard Burr and others); are a disincentive to seeking work (Sen. John Kyl), or, stated another way, pose the risk of creating hobos (Rep. Dean Heller of Nevada). Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah proposed that people receiving federal benefits, including jobless benefits, be tested for drugs.\n\nFar be it from us to analyze the behavior of all people who are out of work or say whether they\u2019d rather collect benefits -- which average about $300 a week -- than get a job. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Federal Reserve Bank estimates that the receipt of unemployment benefits explains only 0.4 to 1.7 percentage points of the unemployment rate, which nationally is 9.8 percent. In other words, most people would rather work.\n\nSo let\u2019s break down Brown\u2019s claim and our fact-finding.", "This entire discussion needs a caveat. MSNBC put Brown on the air because of the ongoing debate over extending federal jobless benefits. The reason for debate is the fact that the federal government has to pick up the tab and it will have to borrow more to do so, at least in the short term. To put matters clearly: You pay into the unemployment compensation through your employer, and that pool of money pays for your state benefits -- but not your federal benefits -- if you lose your job.\n\nWe could use the averages from the three pieces to Brown\u2019s claim -- Half True (but unmeasurable), Mostly True and True -- and arrive at a rating of Mostly True. Or we could turn to the principles of the Truth-o-Meter. According to those principles, a statement is Mostly True if it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nEither way you slice it, we arrive at the same place: Mostly True.", "Sen.
