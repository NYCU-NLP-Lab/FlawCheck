He said he couldn\u2019t breathe and cried out for his mother. Nothing supports claims social media users are sharing that say his death was staged by unseen hands to \"purge\" the United States.", "A sprawling June 1 Facebook post skips from Freemasonry to sacrificial death to martial law. It warns of \"the first annual purge\" prompted by a government that hired people to riot in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. But in the end it\u2019s a conspiracy theory that ignores the social realities of our country.", "\"George Floyd was a freemason and it\u2019s pretty clear what to expect when a person is a freemason,\" the post begins. \"Most of the time Freemsons have a certain period of time where they can live they life to the fullest and then will come an act in which they must participate in which could be sacrifice or a faked death for publicity and an evil agenda to be fulfill WAKE UP everything you see is not REAL! STOP PROTESTING you are feeding into their agendas Martial Law, The first annual purge, A second Wave and even more DEADLY wave of covid 19 the list goes on WAKE UP Do you really think the elites can\u2019t hire people to start riots to initiate the rituals that must take place?

It is not a secret society, since all members are free to acknowledge their membership and will do so in response to inquiries for respectable reasons. Its constitutions and rules are available to the public. There is no secret about its aims and principles.\"", "We reached out to the Minnesota Freemasons.
