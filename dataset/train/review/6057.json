We will update you when more information comes in.", "But the woman is the picture is not Emma Gonz\u00e1lez; the photograph actually shows singer Britney Spears during an infamous February 2007 incident that was widely covered at the time.

(A spokesperson for RR Auction, through whom Ramos intended to sell the umbrella, told us that it was returned to him after it failed to raise an opening bid of $10,000.)", "The use of the photograph of Spears to insult Gonz\u00e1lez is part of a wave of smears directed toward herself and other survivors of the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018; she was also falsely accused of ripping up a copy of the United States Constitution and accused of being a \"communist\" for wearing a patch showing the Cuban flag; Gonz\u00e1lez is actually Cuban-American.", "Fleeman, Mike. \"Britney Spears Apologizes for Umbrella Attack.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 People. 5 July 2007.", "Rolling Stone. \"Britney Spears: A Life in Photos.\"", "Sunderland, Mitchell. \"Paparazzo Auctioning Off Umbrella From Infamous Britney Spears Attack.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Broadly. 21 February 2017.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
