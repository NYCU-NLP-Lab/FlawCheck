As the Independent reported at the time:", "Now, the social media giant has ordered its moderators to consider the context of a photo or image, meaning non-sexual photos including female nipples, such as nursing mothers or women with mastectomies, will be allowed on the website.", "Facebook's Community Standards as of 5 June 2017 maintained:", "We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.", "A Facebook representative told us by e-mail that those standards had not changed:", "As Mark [Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO] mentioned in his community letter, \u201ceach person should see as little objectionable content as possible, and each person should be able to share what they want while being told they cannot share something as little as possible,\u201d so we are always open to finding ways to allow more content. \u00a0With that being said, in general, our policy does not allow female nipples on the platform except in certain circumstances and that that has not changed.", "Bickert, Monica. \u00a0 \"Facebook\u2019s Community Standards: How and Where We Draw the Line.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Facebook Newsroom. \u00a0 23 May 2017.", "Facebook Community Standards. \u00a0 \"Nudity.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 30 May 2017.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
