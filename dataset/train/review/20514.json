["About this rating", "On Aug. 11, 2019, the New York Post ran a story that repeated uncritically a rumor originating from a convicted fraud and former mob informant. The informant claimed he had heard that \u201cUS Attorney General William Barr personally made a hush-hush trip to the [the Metropolitan Correctional Center] two weeks ago, about the time [alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey] Epstein was found in his cell with bruises around his neck.\u201d Several news outlets repeated this claim, and it became entwined with various vague conspiracy theories alleging a nefarious connection between Barr and Epstein:", "It was unclear what Barr was alleged to have done during his purported visit to the detention facility. The Post article, with the headline \u201cJeffrey Epstein Could Have \u2018Paid\u2019 for Help with Suicide: Former Gotti Pal,\u201d relied solely on the speculative musings of a man named Lewis Kasman. Kasman\u2019s expertise on this topic, according to the Post\u2019s reporting, was that he had visited the same facility where Epstein was being kept \u201cseveral times\u201d in 1992, when Kasman's boss, mobster John Gotti, was held there.", "Kasman, who had been referred to in media reports as Gotti's \"adopted son,\" gained notoriety after he \u201cratted out much of the Gambino crime family\u201d as a paid FBI informant beginning in 1995. Years later, in 2010, Kasman would avoid jail time for \u201cobstruction of justice, lying to the FBI, fraud and racketeering\u201d thanks to his previous help aiding the FBI. In 2015, he was arrested in Florida for allegedly stealing money from his own lawyer. He has been the source of dubious claims in the past, including the baseless claim that \u201cJohn Gotti\u2019s brain was taken to Guantanamo for experiments.\u201d", "We reached out to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to ask if AG Barr had paid any visit to the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) during the window of time indicated by Kasman. In response, DOJ Office of Public Affairs Director Kerri Kupec called the claim \u201cpreposterous,\u201d telling us via email that \u201cAttorney General Barr has never visited MCC.\u201d She added that the suggestion of a quiet visit was dubious as well, reminding us \u201cthe Attorney General has 24/7 FBI protective detail. So they would have had to be there, too.\u201d", "We also reached out to Brad Hamilton, the author of the Post story, to ask if Kasman provided any corroborating evidence that made him trust Kasman\u2019s speculation as reportable, given the informant\u2019s history of false or absurd statements. We have not yet received a response. All told, however, the claim has its origins in a man with a history of wild claims whose expertise on the topic is limited to his having made \u201cseveral\u201d visits to the same prison over two decades earlier. As such, we consider the claim without merit.", "Hamilton, Brad. \u00a0 \u201cJeffrey Epstein Could Have \u2018Paid\u2019 for Help With Suicide: Former Gotti Pal.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Post. \u00a0 11 August 2019.", "Edwards, David. \u00a0 \u201cBill Barr Allegedly Made Secret Visit to Jail Before Epstein\u2019s Death: \u2018Something\u2019s Not Right There\u2019.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Raw Story. \u00a0 11 August 2019.", "Vankin, Jonathon. \u00a0 \u201cWilliam Barr Secretly Visited Jail Where Jeffrey Epstein Was Held About Two Weeks Ago, Former Mobster Alleges.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Inquisitr. \u00a0 11 August 2019.", "Capeici, Jerry. \u00a0 \u201cDapper Don as Dashing Don; Kasman Spins More Tall Tales.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Huffington Post. \u00a0 25 May 2011.", "Destefano, Anthony M. \u00a0 \u201cJudge Gives Gotti Confidante Probation on Fraud Charges.\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsday. \u00a0 16 September 2010.", "Marzullo, John and Sasha Goldstein. \u00a0 \u201cLewis Kasman, Mob Rat Who Turned on Gotti\u2019s Gambino Family, Busted in Florida for Theft and Fraud Charges .\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Newsday. \u00a0 11 February 2015.", "Hisaka, Mizuki. \u00a0 \u201cJohn Gotti\u2019s Brain Was Taken to Guantanamo for Experiments, Claims Adopted Son Lewis Kasman Per \u2018Radar Online.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Inquisitr. \u00a0 21 September 2018.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
