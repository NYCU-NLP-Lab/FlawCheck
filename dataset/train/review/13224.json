His classmates voted him \"Most Likely to Succeed.\"", "Opponents of Ohio's estate tax say it hurts the state by driving away wealthy residents.\n\nState Rep. Jay Hottinger, a leader of the drive to repeal the tax in the General Assembly, said a \"shockingly high number\" of Ohioans leave because of the tax. But, the Newark Republican acknowledged on the \"Sound of Ideas\" on WCPN 90.3 FM there is no actual number to cite.\n\n\"When an individual decides to leave my home community in Licking County, believe it or not, they don't take out a press release,\" he said. \"They don't send it to the news media and say, 'We're leaving the state of Ohio because we want to preserve our assets for our heirs.\"\n\nHe pointed to individuals instead, naming the founder of Wendy's restaurants as one example.\n\n\"Dave Thomas left the state literally on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax,\" Hottinger said.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio was stirred. We imagined a dramatic dash for the border in a souped-up medical van.\n\nWanting to know more, we called Hottinger's office for details. When they didn't get back to us, we searched on our own.\n\nWe found a less dramatic story.\n\nThomas died in 2002, after a decade-long battle with liver cancer, at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He had lived there since 1982, when he moved to Florida after retiring as CEO of Wendy\u2019s at age 49. Prior to that, he had lived in Ohio for 20 years.\n\nIf his primary goal at that time of his move was to limit the tax exposure his estate would have after his death, he must have been pleasantly surprised to discover that he also gained the year-round ability to play golf (which he loved) and to cruise on his 90-foot yacht, the I. Lorraine (named for his wife), which he was able to dock behind his home.\n\nA generous philanthropist, particularly in the interests of children's welfare, medicine and education, Thomas supported (and established) a number of organizations and causes in Florida, as he continued to do in Ohio and elsewhere.\n\nHe said his greatest regret was not finishing high school, and in 1993 he hired a tutor and passed the G.E.D. exam. Coconut Creek High School in Fort Lauderdale made him part of its senior class, and awarded his high school diploma. He and his wife were king and queen of the senior prom, and Thomas was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed.\"\n\nLegal residency is not something that can be established by deathbed conversion. Nor is it determined solely by physical presence.\n\nThe point is that Thomas, an adoptee who was born in New Jersey and moved constantly as a boy, spending significant periods in Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana, was no mere Florida visitor or latecomer. Though he still had Ohio homes at Buckeye Lake and in the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington, he registered to vote in Florida, not as an absentee in Ohio, in 1988.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that Thomas (who was survived by his wife, five children and 16 grandchildren) knew a thing or two about taxes, making us doubt that he would have left tax and estate planning to the eleventh hour. \u00a0\n\nGov. Bob Taft credited his support for getting passage of a $500 adoption credit on Ohio income taxes in 1999, and President Clinton gave him credit in 1996 for a federal law giving parents a one-time tax credit of $5,000 when they adopt a child.\n\nThere are other reasons to be skeptical of the claim about Thomas.\n\nIn examining claims about estate taxes elsewhere, PolitiFact Rhode Island found research reporting that estate taxes have little or no impact on the flow of people from one state to another.\n\nThe National Tax Journal in 2006 published \"State \u2018Death\u2019 Taxes and Elderly Migration -- The Chicken or the Egg?,\" whose authors found no evidence that the elderly were responding to changes in estate taxes. Kail Padquitt, staff economist for The Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies federal and state tax policies, told PolitiFact he hasn\u2019t seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to move.\n\nAnd if all this wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s another key fact to consider.\n\nHottinger\u2019s claim was that Thomas fled the state \"literally on his death bed, to avoid estate tax.\" \u00a0That clearly isn\u2019t the case, unless he lingered 20 years before passing. And at that, it would have been three years too soon.\n\nUntil 2005 (three years after Thomas\u2019 death), Florida also had an estate tax.\n\nHottinger\u2019s statement isn\u2019t just inaccurate, it\u2019s also ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, it\u2019s worthy of flame broiling. That\u2019s why we rate it Pants On Fire.", "Comment on this item.", "WCPN 90.3FM, \"The Sound of Ideas,\" Feb. 9, 2011\n\nOhio Department of Taxation, \"A Brief Summary of Major State & Local Taxes in Ohio,\" 2010\n\nWendy's International, Dave Thomas Biography\n\nNew York Times, \"Dave Thomas, 69, Wendy's Founder, Dies,\" Jan. 9, 2002\n\nThe Independent, \"Dave Thomas,\" Jan. 10, 2002\n\nThe Plain Dealer, \"Wendy's founder Dave Thomas dies,\" Jan. 9, 2002\n\nFort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, via The Plain Dealer, \"The thrill of the grill,\" Jan. 26, 1992\n\nAssociated Press, \"Wendy's rebound linked to founder's image,\" May 18, 1991\n\nColumbus Dispatch, \"A great, big lovable man,\" Jan. 9, 2002\n\nLexis-Nexis database search, Dave Thomas\n\nOhio Department of Taxation, \"Personal Income Tax: Residency Guidelines,\" July 2008\n\nJones Day Publications, \"Ohio's New Residency Requirements for Individual Income Tax Purposes,\" January 2008\n\nPolitiFact Rhode Island, \"Ocean State Policy Research Institute says Rhode Island's estate tax is the most significant reason people leave the state,\" Feb. 13, 2011\n\nFlorida Department of Revenue, \"Florida's Estate Tax,\" 2010\n\nFlorida Estate and Tax Blog, \"Florida Estate Taxes,\" Oct. 5, 2010", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
