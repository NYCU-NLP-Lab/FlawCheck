She has faced pushback from critics who assail her call for healthier school lunches as forcing kids to eat unappetizing meals\u00a0and who say she\u2019s second-guessing parents who know what\u2019s best for their kids better than the government does.", "Now, a new front against her has opened in the conservative blogosphere: Michelle Obama, critics say, is requiring day care centers to track their children\u2019s weight.", "A reader tipped us off to this social media phenomenon, which has been driven by such headlines as \"Michelle Obama Sending Government Monitors To Weigh Children In Daycare\" (downtrend.com), \"Government plans to weigh and measure your child in daycare,\" (American Thinker), \"Michelle O Mandates Weighing Children in Daycare,\" (InfoWars), and \"Michelle Obama Now Mandating Daycare Centers Weigh Kids\" (Western Journalism Center).", "So is Michelle Obama really mandating the weighing of children in day care?
