Almost 800,000 people benefit from the program.", "More than 41,000 of those recipients are in New York state, the fourth most of any state. Slaughter claimed in a tweet that ending DACA would be bad for business.", "\"#POTUS\u2019 decision will harm our economy and endanger the future of thousands of Americans,\" Slaughter tweeted.", "DACA allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. They can apply to renew their status after those two years.", "DACA recipients have many of the same obligations as permanent U.S. residents, like paying income tax.", "But will ending DACA be bad for the economy?", "Origin of the data", "Slaughter's claim\u00a0comes from a recent report by the Center of American Progress, a left-leaning policy research organization.", "It estimated the U.S. would lose $460.3 billion over a decade if working DACA recipients were deported.

The analysts assumed the labor characteristics of the DACA workforce were the same as other undocumented workers.", "The data applies only to DACA recipients who are employed, which the analysts estimated to be about 87 percent in each state.", "Other research", "Researchers on the other side of the political spectrum agree ending DACA would harm the country\u2019s economy, but they dispute the amount.", "The Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy group, estimated the national economy would lose $283 billion over the next decade if all DACA recipients were deported.

Undocumented immigrants eligible for DACA contribute more than $2 billion in state and local taxes each year, according to research from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. More than $140 million comes from DACA eligible immigrants in New York state.", "The bigger part is that DACA allows immigrants to enter the labor force without restrictions, creating a domino effect that\u2019s good for business.", "\"When you have people working it helps the larger economic activity of the area,\" Wolgin said. \"When there\u2019s a bigger supply of immigrants, businesses ramp up their business and their hiring.\"", "At the same time, these immigrants are not eligible for most public benefits, like Medicaid or food stamps.", "Our ruling", "Slaughter said ending DACA would\u00a0harm the economy.", "Researchers dispute\u00a0the amount but confirm\u00a0Slaughter\u2019s claim that deporting DACA recipients would do more harm than good for the economy.", "We rate her claim True.", "Tweet from Rep.
