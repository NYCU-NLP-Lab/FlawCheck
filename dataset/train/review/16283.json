["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "A barrage of invective hit Wisconsin Governor-elect Scott Walker after the federal government announced it would give nearly all of Wisconsin\u2019s $810 million in high-speed rail funds to other states.\n\nHalf a dozen local, state and national Democrats issued statements Dec. 9, 2010 condemning the Republican for his staunch opposition to the Milwaukee-to-Madison train, all focusing on the loss of jobs that would result.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin joined in with the highest figure, declaring that Walker had \"killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs.\"\n\nWalker, who takes office Jan. 3, could rightly be credited -- or blamed, depending on your point of view -- with killing the rail line. Indeed, so vehement was his vow to stop its construction that, in our view, he prematurely declared the proposal dead even when it still had some locomotion.\n\nThere is no doubt that jobs tied to the train will be lost; Walker has acknowledged as much.\n\nBut what about the 13,000 figure used by the state Democrats?\n\nIf the scenery on this ride looks familiar, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been down this track \u00a0before.\n\nWe rated as Barely True a November claim by the Sierra Club that refusing the federal rail money would cost Wisconsin nearly 10,000 permanent jobs -- that is, jobs aside from the construction-related ones. The claim relied on an analysis based on a host of assumptions, including the impact of an entirely built network connecting Midwest cities.\n\nGiven the more recent outcry over the rail money, we decided to start our count anew.\n\nThe Democratic Party told us it pegged the loss at 13,000 jobs based on a report on the high-speed rail project by the WISPIRG Foundation, which supported the project. WISPIRG is a nonprofit group that says it \"works to protect consumers and promote good government.\"\n\nBruce Speight, WISPIRG\u2019s state director, said WISPIRG used Wisconsin\u2019s federal grant application for the rail money to arrive at the 13,000 jobs. \u00a0\n\nHere are the number of full-time-equivalent jobs the state\u2019s application projected would be created during construction of the Milwaukee-to-Madison line:", "Think about the figures this way:\n\nThe state projected that in Year 1, the rail line construction itself, plus economic activity generated by the construction, would create 1,281 jobs\u2019 worth of work; in Year 2, there would be 4,060 jobs\u2019 worth of work; and so on.\n\nThe figures represent \"job-years,\" not actual jobs, said Jon Dyck, a fiscal analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. A job-year, he said, is one person being employed for one year as a result of the rail line construction.\n\nIn a memo Dyck wrote on the project, he cited the number of jobs per year that the state had projected in its grant application. He did not add the figures for the six years together to arrive at a total jobs figure.\n\nBut that is what the Democratic Party did -- just as WISPIRG did in its report -- to get its total of 13,000 jobs.\n\nThat approach can lead to double counting. Clearly, some of the people hired in Year 1 will also be working in Year 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the state\u2019s numbers show a rise of employment, as construction peaks, and then a fall as it tails off.\n\nIn Year 3, for example, the amount of work was projected to produce 5,535 jobs, but that number drops to 1,847 in Year 4.\n\nBut under the math used to get to 13,000, they\u2019re actually added together, for a total of 7,382 jobs in years 3 and 4. \u00a0\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jim Doyle was the first to use that approach.\n\nAfter the state filed its grant application in October 2009, Doyle\u2019s office issued a news release saying the rail line would create \"nearly 13,000 jobs by 2013.\"\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel later reported, however, that the only way to reach that figure (12,723) would be to add the jobs from years 1 through 4.\n\nIf you carried out Doyle\u2019s job counting over the full six years that were covered in the state\u2019s application, you would exceed 13,000 jobs -- the number the Democratic Party seized on.\n\nDoyle\u2019s administration defended its method of counting to the newspaper, saying the grant application simply followed a formula requested by the federal government.\n\nBut Doyle\u2019s job counting led the WISPIRG Foundation to issue a correction of its report, Speight told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Since then, WISPIRG, like some other rail supporters, estimates only that \"thousands\" of jobs would have been created by the Milwaukee-to-Madison line.\n\nIndeed, in the statement Doyle issued after loss of the federal funds, he referred only to \"thousands of jobs\" that the money could have created in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Democratic Party, however, stayed with 13,000 -- not only in its news release, but in a billboard it put up in Milwaukee four days later.\n\nThat brings us to the end of the line.\n\nThe state Democratic Party claimed that Walker\u2019s opposition to high-speed rail not only cost Wisconsin nearly $810 million in federal funds, but it \"killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs.\" The party relied on a report by an organization that two months earlier had disavowed the number after it was discredited by the Journal Sentinel. \u00a0\n\nPerhaps thousands of jobs were at stake, but there is no evidence that 13,000 jobs were lost. What\u2019s more, that has been clear for some time -- and most everyone else has stopped using the figure.\n\nWe rate the party\u2019s claim as Pants on Fire.", "E-mail interview, Governor-elect Scott Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie, Dec. 10, 2010\n\nE-mail interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, Dec. 10, 2010\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation announcement, Dec. 9, 2010\n\nWisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Milwaukee to Madison High Speed Rail project memo, Nov. 22, 2010\n\nStatements issued Dec. 9, 2010, by Wisconsin state Rep.
