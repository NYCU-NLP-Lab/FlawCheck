["By Jessica McDonald", "Posted on June 12, 2020", "At a June 8 press conference, a World Health Organization scientist confusingly suggested that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus is \u201cvery rare\u201d \u2014 a statement that many scientists found problematic, and which some politicians and those on social media seized upon as evidence that certain public health measures were not necessary.", "It is well documented that people without symptoms can transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it is not yet known how often that happens, or how frequently that involves someone who is completely asymptomatic.", "Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist and the WHO\u2019s COVID-19 technical lead who was responsible for the remarks, clarified the next day that the amount of transmission from people who are asymptomatic is a \u201ca big open question.\u201d She said her original comment applied to only a subset of studies and data from member states, and pertained only to those who are truly asymptomatic.", "\u201cWe do know that some people who are asymptomatic, or some people who don\u2019t have symptoms, can transmit the virus on,\u201d she said in a live online Q&A event. \u201cWhat I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were a very few studies, some two or three studies, that have been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases.\u201d", "While we are not privy to the member state data, Van Kerkhove is mostly right that the few epidemiology studies that exist have found little onward transmission from truly asymptomatic people, although she may have exaggerated. One study that the WHO cited in its mask guidance identified no secondary transmission from asymptomatic cases, but another identified spread from nine people, or 14% of asymptomatic cases.", "Dr. Oyuka Byambasuren, a researcher at Bond University\u2019s Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Australia who co-authored a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing asymptomatic transmission, told us that based on the available data, WHO was correct to state that asymptomatic transmission is low, but that the term \u201cvery rare\u201d was \u201cprobably inappropriate.\u201d", "Van Kerkhove\u2019s initial summary also failed to include modeling studies that have found significantly higher contributions to transmission from people without symptoms, which she acknowledged.", "Much of the core confusion, however, stems from semantics and the use of the term asymptomatic, which in scientific circles typically means a person who never has any symptoms throughout the disease course. That\u2019s in contrast to someone who is pre-symptomatic, and goes on to develop symptoms later, and to those who have only very mild symptoms.", "Right now, there\u2019s substantial evidence that people without symptoms can spread the disease, which is why public health officials are encouraging the use of face masks and social distancing, along with other pandemic prevention efforts.", "But exactly how much spread is from pre-symptomatic people versus those who never develop any symptoms whatsoever is less clear.", "As Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, told us, there\u2019s \u201cpretty good data\u201d showing that pre-symptomatic people are responsible for some transmission of COVID-19. But there\u2019s less information about people who stay symptom-free.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t actually know, to date, the degree to which people who have no symptoms ever \u2014 throughout the time they have this virus \u2014 to what extent they\u2019re responsible for driving this pandemic,\u201d he said.", "This wrinkle may have been what Van Kerkhove was trying to discuss, but the message many people heard was that the virus doesn\u2019t spread when people don\u2019t have symptoms.", "One Facebook meme falsely claimed that the WHO was \u201cnow saying they were wrong\u201d and that \u201cit seems like the \u2018conspiracy theorist\u2019 were right again.\u201d The post went on to say, \u201cThis was never about a deadly virus,\u201d and that the WHO meant that an \u201casymptomatic person cannot transfer the virus.\u201d", "That\u2019s not true. Not only did Van Kerkhove not say that, but as WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted in a June 10 press conference, the agency has said since early February that \u201casymptomatic people can transmit COVID-19, but that we need more research to establish the extent of asymptomatic transmission.\u201d", "Another post, which was a snapshot of a tweet from the conservative commentator Liz Wheeler, pointed to lockdowns and business closures for healthy people, saying, \u201cThe WHO now says asymptomatic transmission is rare. We\u2019ve been duped. Again.\u201d", "Some Republican politicians also jumped on the news. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio declared, \u201cReopen America!\u201d on Twitter while retweeting a CNBC story about the WHO\u2019s comments.", "Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, sharing the same story, said in a tweet, \u201cGood News!\u00a0 People who catch coronovirus but have no symptoms rarely spread the disease.\u00a0 Translation:\u00a0 sending kids back to school does not require millions of test kits.\u201d", "The CNBC story was subsequently updated, and another story explaining the WHO\u2019s clarification was published the morning of June 9. The article appeared after Paul\u2019s tweet, but minutes before Jordan\u2019s sharing of the first article. Neither politician shared news of the WHO\u2019s clarification about the matter.", "We\u2019ll review what the WHO said, the evidence on asymptomatic transmission and why the issue has become so muddled.", "Van Kerkhove\u2019s first comments came at the end of the WHO\u2019s June 8 press conference, when a Reuters reporter asked about asymptomatic spread, given reports in Singapore that at least half of new cases were without symptoms.", "Van Kerkhove started by noting that in many countries, when COVID-19 cases have been contact traced, many of the seemingly asymptomatic cases were not completely without symptoms, but rather, had very mild symptoms.", "\u201cThey may not have developed fever yet, they may not have had a significant cough, or they may not have shortness of breath,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there were some people who were truly asymptomatic as well.", "She then turned to the question of how many asymptomatic people transmit the virus, saying that that assessment requires careful monitoring of individuals to look for secondary transfer.", "\u201cWe have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They\u2019re following asymptomatic cases, they\u2019re following contacts, and they\u2019re not finding secondary transmission onward,\u201d Van Kerkhove said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare.\u201d", "She added that much of that evidence is not published, and pointed to a few other published studies.", "\u201cWe are constantly looking at this data and we\u2019re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.\u201d", "Van Kerkhove then said during a social media Q&A on June 9 that she wanted to make \u201csome clarifications\u201d to address \u201cperhaps some of the misunderstandings\u201d from what she said the day before.", "Her first point was that it\u2019s not clear how many people are truly asymptomatic, with some estimates ranging from 6% to 41% of the infected population.", "\u201cWe know that people who are infected with COVID-19, many develop symptoms. But there are some people who do not,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to truly understand how many people don\u2019t have symptoms, we don\u2019t actually have that answer yet.\u201d", "On transmission from asymptomatic people, and her statement the day prior, Van Kerkhove said she was referring to \u201csome two or three studies\u201d along with information from member states.", "\u201cI was responding to a question at the press conference, I wasn\u2019t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that, I was just trying to articulate what we know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in that, I used the phrase \u2018very rare,\u2019 and I think that that\u2019s [a] misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic spread globally is very rare.\u201d", "Calling the amount of asymptomatic transmission a \u201cmajor unknown,\u201d she also said that she had neglected to mention modeling studies which have arrived at much higher estimates of transmission from people without symptoms.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a big range from the different models, depending on how the models are done,\u201d she said. \u201cBut some estimates of around 40% of transmission may be due to asymptomatic [spread]. But those are from models. And so I didn\u2019t include that in my answer yesterday, but wanted to make sure I covered that here.\u201d", "Some scientists considered Van Kerkhove\u2019s first remarks a misunderstanding, while others were more critical.", "\u201cI think that that comment was taken out of context and misunderstood,\u201d Peter Hotez, the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University, told us. \u201cIf you\u2019re communicating a lot, eventually you\u2019ll have missteps.\u201d", "The Harvard Global Health Institute issued a statement over email saying that the WHO \u201ccreated confusion,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll of the best evidence suggests that people without symptoms can and do readily spread SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\u201d", "\u201cIn fact, some evidence suggest[s] that people may be most infectious in the days before they become symptomatic \u2014 that is, in the pre-symptomatic phase when they feel well, have no symptoms, but may be shedding substantial amounts of virus,\u201d the statement continued.", "Bogoch called her comments a \u201cmistake,\u201d noting that the WHO is under a lot of pressure, but that it has to get its communication right. \u201cIt was a bit of an oversimplification, and required clarification and some correction,\u201d he told us.", "But Bogoch also said that the scientific community had not been diligent in differentiating between the mildly symptomatic, the pre-symptomatic and the completely asymptomatic.", "\u201cFrom the very beginning, the studies that have been published have not really been entirely clear on distinguishing between these groups,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s done us a tremendous disservice.\u201d", "He pointed to several high-profile studies that on the surface seem to suggest that a relatively high number COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic, but which are not able to fully make those claims because of incomplete reporting.", "For example, one study in Iceland, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April, observed that 43% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 did not have symptoms at the time, but it did not follow-up with participants to see if they developed symptoms later.", "Another widely cited but unpublished paper from Vo, Italy, which found that around 40% of cases were asymptomatic, Bogoch said, was problematic because the authors limited the symptoms to fever and cough.", "\u201cWe know that\u2019s not fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of other symptoms for COVID-19, and fever and cough are not sufficient.\u201d", "\u201cMost studies, or most data that are reported, are from people tested at a single time point. So they are a mix of people who will develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) if followed for long enough and those who will remain asymptomatic,\u201d explained Dr. Nicola Low, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.", "Low is a co-author of a\u00a0systematic review and meta-analysis posted to the preprint server medRxiv synthesizing the available information about asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Based on 28 studies with adequate follow-up, she said, she estimates that about 15% of people remain asymptomatic throughout infection.", "A separate systematic review and meta-analysis, posted to medRxiv and cited by the WHO in its mask guidance, came up with the same percentage for asymptomatic cases.", "Bond University\u2019s Byambasuren, who led the review, told us that the results were based on nine \u201cgood studies,\u201d and that the team only included \u201cstudies with a valid sampling process and followed people for at least 7 days after their initial positive test\u201d to tease out the asymptomatic cases from the pre-symptomatic ones.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, has pegged the approximate number of asymptomatic cases, based on data as of the end of April, at 35%.", "Evaluating how frequently people who are truly asymptomatic pass on the virus is even trickier than pinning down the percentage of asymptomatic cases.", "The minimal data that does exist, Bogoch said, does point to relatively uncommon transmission.", "A small study of an outbreak in a South Korean call center, for example, found four asymptomatic cases out of 97 infections, and none of those people\u2019s household contacts acquired secondary infections.", "A contact tracing investigation in Taiwan also found no transmission from nine asymptomatic patients to 91 close contacts.", "But, Bogoch said, those glimmers of evidence aren\u2019t enough to really come to a conclusion about asymptomatic spread. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely clear if it\u2019s very rare just yet,\u201d he said.", "In her review, Byambasuren included four studies \u2014 the two previously mentioned ones plus two others \u2014\u00a0 with estimates of asymptomatic transmission that could be compared with symptomatic transmission. For those few studies, the asymptomatic transmission rate ranged from 0% to 2.2%, while the symptomatic transmission rate ranged from 0.8% to 15.4%.", "\u201cFrom our research we estimate that asymptomatic people transmit about 40% less than symptomatic people,\u201d she said, noting that could be because those people are infectious for a shorter period of time and because they produce fewer infectious respiratory droplets because they\u2019re not coughing or sneezing. \u201cUnfortunately, based on the available data we cannot rule out that both cases could transmit equally.\u201d", "Low said that rigorously determining how often asymptomatic people transmit the virus in a study is incredibly hard to do, so the alternative is to look at mathematical models of transmission.", "\u201cThey generally find that 40-60% of all transmission comes from people who didn\u2019t have symptoms at the time,\u201d she said.", "Separately from her other analysis of the proportion of asymptomatic cases, Low assessed four modeling studies, three of which evaluated pre-symptomatic transmission only. According to her review, the fourth study, published in the journal Science by researchers in the U.K., found that asymptomatic transmission was responsible for 6% of transmission while pre-symptomatic transmission contributed 47%.", "Some experts nevertheless cautioned against making too much of modeling studies.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to model data,\u201d Bogoch said. \u201cAnd every model\u2019s going to have assumptions.\u201d", "\u201cWe need actual data rather than modeling studies,\u201d Byambasuren said.", "Multiple experts told us that while the debate over asymptomatic transmission may appear to be an academic exercise, it\u2019s one that ultimately matters.", "\u201cContact tracing and testing relies on most people becoming symptomatic so they can be isolated and their contacts \u2013 symptomatic or not \u2013 be quarantined,\u201d said Byambasuren. \u201cPre-symptomatic cases make this slower, but can still be detected; whereas fully asymptomatic cases make it much harder \u2013 and rely on being captured by the contact tracing of symptomatic cases.\u201d", "Accordingly, if more asymptomatic spread is happening than previously thought, more testing might be necessary to contain the virus.", "Bogoch said that it could be a major boon to public health if it turns out that many of the people who are thought to be asymptomatic are actually mildly symptomatic or exhibit more unusual COVID-19 symptoms. If the public could be better educated about that, more people could be caught earlier in infection and their contacts could be traced, limiting community spread.", "Still, even if true asymptomatic spread is rare \u2014 which is still up for debate \u2014 scientists said the takeaway should not be that people can abandon precautionary measures.", "\u201cThere is evidence that people can transmit to others before they develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic period),\u201d explained University of Florida biostatistician Natalie Dean in a Twitter thread. \u201cThis means that people without current symptoms can be infectious.\u201d", "And despite the confusion, Van Kerkhove noted at the end of her social media Q&A that the uncertainty about coronavirus transmission \u2014 including the amount stemming from any type of person who lacks symptoms \u2014 is why physical distancing, hand washing, wearing face masks and following stay-at-home orders is so important. \u201cThat\u2019s why all of that is really, really critical,\u201d she said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
