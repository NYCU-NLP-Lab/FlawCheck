["State Sen. Amanda Chase, who calls herself \"Donald Trump in heels,\" recently failed to prove her claim that Virginia\u2019s fall elections were rigged.", "Chase, R-Chesterfield County, is running for governor in 2021 as an Independent, having recently abandoned her Republican candidacy in the wake of feuds with state GOP leaders. She\u2019s been calling for gun rights, the preservation of Confederate monuments, and has opposed COVID-19 restrictions. Since the Nov. 3 election - which Democrat Joe Biden won in Virginia with 450,000 more votes than Trump - she\u2019s been promising to \"expose the voter fraud that\u2019s going on in Virginia.\"", "During a Dec. 1 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond, conservative host John Reid pressed Chase to prove her fraud claim, and she focused on Chesterfield\u2019s heavily Democratic Southside precinct. Here\u2019s the conversation:", "Reid: \"If there\u2019s an overvote, if it\u2019s supposed to be - and I\u2019m just picking a number - 85,000 people are registered to vote and then 87,000 votes are counted, then you don\u2019t have to be a Ph.D. from M.I.T. to know you\u2019ve got a problem. Is it that simple; are we seeing that? Is that true or not true?\"", "Chase:\u00a0 \"...There are situations, historically, like I know in Chesterfield, the Southside precinct is infamous for having over 100% of the vote count, which really should be impossible if they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing.\"", "Reid: \"...You\u2019re saying there are places where over 100%?\"", "Chase: \"There are, yeah. Absolutely.\"", "Reid: \"This year?\"", "Chase: \"I haven\u2019t looked at that particular precinct this year. But I know in years past I\u2019ve actually, before I ran for office, I worked behind the scenes to get Republicans elected and I would go to the Southside precinct because I remember (it) historically having over 100% voting and I\u2019m like, that\u2019s a precinct I want to go work, and I actually saw voters coming in with stacks of votes. They were illegally harvesting votes is what was going on.", "We fact-checked Chase\u2019s overvoting claim, using election records from the Chesterfield registrar\u2019s office.", "The Southside precinct is near Meadowbrook High School, roughly between Iron Bridge and Cogbill Roads. The working-class precinct was established in 2008, and its highest turnout came that year when 70% of its voters cast ballots in the presidential election won by Democrat Barack Obama. That was below the statewide 74% turnout.", "We asked Chase to reconcile the statistics with her overvote claim, and she said she might have gotten things wrong. \"Maybe it didn\u2019t happen,\" she said. \"It was a memory I had in the back of my mind.\"", "She added, \"I wouldn\u2019t put any credence in what I was saying.\"", "Records show the Southside precinct has voted overwhelmingly Democratic in each of 27 contested elections it has seen since its start. Chase lost the precinct by 3-to-1 ratios in her 2015 and 2019 state Senate races.", "Our ruling", "Chase, trying to prove there\u2019s voting fraud in Virginia, says Chesterfield\u2019s Southside precinct is infamous for logging more votes than there are voters.", "Election records show the strongly-Democratic precinct has never had a voter turnout greater than 70% in its 12-year history. Presented with statistics, Chase says of her overvote claim \"maybe it didn\u2019t happen,\" and \"I wouldn\u2019t put any credence in what I was saying.\"", "Chase\u2019s voting fraud claim is fatuous\u00a0and inflammatory.
