["AFP Fact Check\u2019s reporters in Germany first debunked the 20-minute German-language video by neurologist Margareta Griesz-Brisson after it was shared more than 30,000 times on Facebook.", "The earliest German-language posts that AFP Fact Check found are from September 25, 2020, on YouTube and Facebook. Since then, the video has been circulating widely on\u00a0Facebook and Instagram.", "The multiple claims in the video have been translated into English and shared in Facebook posts including here and here, along with a summary of the claims in image form.", "In the video, Griesz-Brisson criticises the German government\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic response and warns her viewers against wearing face masks.", "She claims that masks let the virus through and wearing them creates a lack of oxygen as well as a flood of carbon dioxide in the body. She goes on to claim that nerve cells in the brain will die off after a short time.", "In the video, Griesz-Brisson introduces herself as a neurologist with a practice in London and a second practice in M\u00fcllheim, in southern Germany.", "On the homepage of the London practice, it says Griesz-Brisson completed a doctorate at the University of Freiburg. A dissertation by Margareta Griesz from 1989 can be found in the university database.", "Griesz-Brisson specialises in natural treatment methods according to this DVD, which is a recording from a congress in 2006. There, she talked about detoxification of heavy metals from the body. She is also cited in connection with a \u201cdetox ion foot bath\u201d therapy.", "In a video on Vimeo from 2017, she talked about her natural medicine approach, saying that as much as possible, she rejects everything she considers unnatural in her treatments \u2013\u00a0for example, plasters.", "After publishing her Facebook video, Griesz-Brisson made a number of public appearances. In an October 5, 2020 video on Bitchute, she promises to issue mask-exemption certificates for everyone, even those she had\u00a0not seen as a patient. She was recently also a guest on the stage of a lateral-thinking event in Konstanz, southern Germany, on October 4, 2020.", "No publications by Griesz-Brisson can be found in the Google Scholar or PubMed databases. She justifies this in the video on Bitchute by saying that she doesn\u2019t like to write or talk.", "AFP Fact Check reviewed Griesz-Brisson\u2019s claims, which were summarised in the posts in English.", "The first claim holds that face masks are harmful to an individual\u2019s health: \u201cThe rebreathing of our exhaled air will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of carbon dioxide,\u201d the posts read.", "AFP Fact Check asked Philipp Lepper, a member of the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP) and senior physician at the Saarland University Hospital, about the veracity of the claim.", "\u201cSince the amount of air behind the mask is very small and is mixed with fresh air each time you breathe in, this has no effect on the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels measured in the body,\u201d he added.", "Lepper explained that this is possible because air flows freely through the mask.", "\u201cAn oxygen molecule has a size of around 260 picometers. The pore size of medical mouth and nose masks is around 100,000 to 1,000,000 times larger than an oxygen molecule,\u201d he said. A face mask would not hold back any of the components of the air \u2013\u00a0not oxygen and not even CO\u2082.", "AFP Fact Check has previously disproved claims about the concentration of CO\u2082 collecting beneath face masks here and here.", "But why do we sometimes heave or breathe more heavily while wearing a mask if there isn\u2019t a lack of oxygen?AFP Fact Check contacted Dominic Dellweg, chief physician of pulmonology and intensive care medicine at Germany\u2019s Fachkrankenhaus Kloster Grafschaft hospital.", "He replied in an email on October 6, 2020:\u00a0\u201cThe mask provides additional resistance for our breathing. Our respiratory muscles have to work harder to breathe the air through the mask. It can be uncomfortable and even cause shortness of breath.\u201d", "However, he added\u00a0that \u201cthis is not an expression of an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body.\u201d\u00a0There is still enough oxygen being inhaled; he said\u00a0this feeling of resistance can\u00a0lead to a false alarm in the body but is not harmful.", "\u201cThis increased exertion is reported to the brain as shortness of breath via receptors in the respiratory muscles, although the values for oxygen and carbon dioxide are in the normal range,\u201d said Dellweg.", "The World Health Organization reiterates this on its website: \u201cThe prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO\u2082 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency.\u201d", "Asked if masks could be dangerous for people with prior health conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Philipp Latzin, head of the pediatric pulmonology department at the University Children's Hospital Inselspital Bern, said no.", "As for whether masks lead to a change in oxygen saturation or CO\u2082 in the blood, Latzin responded by quoting a new study from the University of Miami: \u201cThis was not the case either in healthy individuals or in patients with severe COPD.\u201d", "The study had its limitations: It only included 30 people who took six-minute walks and spent 30 minutes at rest; 15 of them were healthy persons around 30 years old and the other 15 were around 70 years old with severe COPD.", "The study found that gas exchange is not significantly affected by the use of surgical masks, even in subjects with severe lung impairment.", "A German study, published by Deutsches \u00c4rzteblatt on October 2, 2020, came to a similar conclusion using healthy volunteers. It says: \u201cIn summary, a short-term high workload under common mask types used in hospitals seems to have a measurable, but clinically irrelevant influence on blood gases and vital parameters in people of working age without a known underlying cardiopulmonary disease.\u201d", "Yves Coppieters, epidemiologist and professor of public health at the Free University of Brussels, also explained to AFP Fact Check in July that a mask poses no problem of lack of oxygen for people in good health: \u201cThe mask is not a closed circuit, it allows oxygen to pass.\u201d", "He added, however, \u201cit can possibly interfere with the breathing of a person with heart or respiratory problems or when exerting great effort\u201d.", "AFP Fact Check has previously disproved multiple claims about masks causing a lack of oxygen in the body here (in English) and here (in French).", "Griesz-Brisson claims numerous health consequences are caused by using face masks: \u201cWe know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. There are nerve cells, for example in the hippocampus, that can\u2019t go longer than three minutes without oxygen\u00a0\u2013they cannot survive.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check asked Peter Berlit, Secretary General of the German Society for Neurology, about this claim.", "He said that it\u2019s true that there are nerve cells that would not survive for more than three minutes without oxygen. However, as already shown above, this cannot be triggered by wearing a mask, since it does not cut off oxygen.", "In her video, Griesz-Brisson warns that the acute warning symptoms of a lack of oxygen are\u00a0\u201cheadaches, drowsiness, dizziness, issues in concentration, slowing down of the reaction time \u2013\u00a0reactions of the cognitive system.\u201d", "\u201cHowever, when you have chronic oxygen deprivation, all of those symptoms disappear, because you get used to it. But your efficiency will remain impaired and the undersupply of oxygen in your brain continues to progress,\u201d\u00a0she says.", "She says she herself does not wear a mask: \u201cI need my brain to think. I want to have a clear head when I deal with my patients, and not be in a carbon dioxide-induced anaesthesia.\u201d", "Berlit said these symptoms are \u201cnot possible when wearing everyday masks made of fabric and surgical masks\u201d.", "He explained: \u201cThe symptoms mentioned can occur with long-term rebreathing of CO\u2082 for example from an airtight plastic bag.\u201d", "The post says that it \u201cmust be the free decision of every human being whether they want to wear a mask that is absolutely ineffective to protect themselves from a virus\u201d.", "AFP Fact Check has already debunked similar claims here and here about the level of protection masks offer.", "As explained above, the virus is transmitted through larger aerosols in the air which are carrying the virus on particles. \u201cCommercially-available mouth and nose masks can filter off these particles \u2013 to a certain extent,\u201d said Lepper.", "In May 2020, Lepper published a study that showed that people wearing face masks primarily protect others from potentially contaminated exhaled air. The filter performance would vary depending on the material used.", "AFP Fact Check contacted Griesz-Brisson by email on October 14, 2020. She responded with an email that did not answer AFP\u2019s questions but asked for respect for her work and experience. In it, she criticised the federal government\u2019s requirement to wear masks.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023. All rights reserved.
