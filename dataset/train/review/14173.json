The proposal,\u00a0which failed, would have eliminated cost-of-living increases for one year for Social Security and Medicare.", "Fast forward a decade to 1995, and Biden twice\u00a0cited\u00a0that proposal to explain his support for a balanced budget amendment and to prove his bona fides as someone serious about reducing deficits.", "For example, on Jan. 31, 1995,\u00a0Biden said\u00a0from the floor of the Senate, \u201cWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time. Somebody has to tell me in here how we are going to do this hard work without dealing with any of those sacred cows, some deserving more protection than others.

These were the very things that Biden claimed during the debate that he pushed for in 2005 in order to win his support.", "\u201c[A] feature of this legislation that I think deserves much more emphasis is its historic improvement in the treatment of family support payments \u2014 child support and alimony,\u201d Biden said on Dec. 7, 2000.", "After Clinton vetoed the bill, Grassley reintroduced the Bankruptcy Reform Act in July 2001 and Biden co-sponsored it. Biden was a member of an informal conference committee to work on the bankruptcy bill, and the committee was scheduled to have its first meeting on Sept. 12, 2001 \u2014 which, as it turned out, was the day after the 9/11 terrorist attack. At the time, Congressional Quarterly described Biden as \u201cone of the measure\u2019s most vocal supporters.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until 2005 that the bankruptcy bill became law.", "As he did in 2000, Hatch praised Biden for his help on the bill on the day that the Senate passed the legislation. Hatch said Biden had worked \u201ctirelessly for years on this legislation, and they have taken some tough votes to get it done.\u201d", "And, as he did in 2000, Biden spoke in support of the bill\u2019s provisions that made it easier for women and children to collect alimony and child support. \u201cI am here again today to show that, contrary to a lot of the rhetoric that has been tossed around, this bill actually improves the situation of women and children who depend on child support,\u201d Biden said.", "Contrary to his claims during the debate, Biden helped write the bankruptcy law, and it wasn\u2019t just because he knew the bill was going to become law under a Republican president and Republican Congress.

Sanders could not have known that when he voted against the funds.", "Biden is referring to Sanders\u2019 vote in January 2009 to block release of a second $350 billion in TARP funds, again mainly to aid financial institutions. This time it was clear that some of that would aid automakers \u2014 but it amounted to only $4 billion of the total.", "This isn\u2019t the first time Sanders has been unfairly accused of opposing the auto bailout.

We\u2019ve got thousands of private insurance plans,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat is not a system that is prepared to provide health care to all people. In a good year, without the epidemic, we\u2019re losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don\u2019t get to a doctor on time. It\u2019s clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse.\u201d", "Later, the Vermont senator offered a different figure: \u201cYou know what, last year at least 30,000 people died in America because they didn\u2019t get health care when they should because we don\u2019t have universal coverage. I think that\u2019s a crisis.\u201d", "But, as we\u2019ve written several times, it\u2019s hard to pin down the precise number of deaths in the U.S. attributable to lacking insurance \u2014 although multiple studies have estimated thousands of excess deaths from absent insurance coverage.", "PolitiFact looked last year specifically at Sanders\u2019 claim that \u201c30,000 Americans a year die waiting for health care because of the cost\u201d and found it \u201clacks meaningful support either way. It could be true. But it also could easily not be.\u201d", "Our fact-checking colleagues traced the figure to Physicians for a National Health Program, which advocates for a single-payer health care system. PNHP cited the findings of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a study in which some people in the state were given Medicaid by lottery and others remained uninsured.", "But while that study \u201cyielded important findings,\u201d the death rate differential was not statistically significant, PolitiFact noted, citing Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor of health policy and economics at Harvard. Therefore, it didn\u2019t \u201cgenerate sufficient evidence spelling out the link between insurance coverage and mortality\u201d \u2014 so it couldn\u2019t be confidently applied to the country.", "We wrote in 2009 about another study by researchers with the Harvard Medical School \u2014 two of whom had strong connections to PNHP \u2014 that claimed 45,000 deaths a year could be attributed to the lack of health insurance. We found that was at the high end of estimates, but earlier studies also put the figure in the thousands.", "The higher figure cited by Sanders \u2014 \u201c60,000\u201d \u2014 may refer to a recent study from Yale researchers that examined Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal. That study looked at uninsured populations and the notion that \u201cuninsured people experience a 40% elevation in age-specific mortality risk,\u201d\u00a0and concluded that \u201cuniversal coverage would save 68,531 lives\u201d annually.", "Discussing women\u2019s reproductive rights, Biden touted a \u201c100% rating\u201d from the group NARAL Pro-Choice America.

I know what happens; I watched the whole Delmarva Peninsula, just like it is in South Carolina and the rest.", "Delaware is the lowest-lying state in the U.S. and is highly susceptible to sea level rise from climate change.

The average elevation across the state is 60 feet\u00a0above sea level.", "A Delaware Geological Survey map shows that a relatively\u00a0small portion\u00a0of the state, mostly along the coast, is 5 feet or less above sea level.", "This time, Biden also referenced the Delmarva Peninsula, which is the piece of land that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean south of New Jersey.
