["One post shared more than 500 times since December 7, 2020, and archived here, claims that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had signed\u00a0 an executive order stating that \u201cqualified citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in some special professions are eligible for 10 years Canada E-Visa (sic).\u201d", "It further claims that \u201cthe terms of the Executive Order allows ONLY 6,000 citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria taking effects from the 21st day of September, 2020 till 30th Day of December, 2020 (sic)\u201d, implying a limited period for applications.", "In addition, the post lists purported requirements for potential applicants and ends with the apparent sanction of Nigerian High Commissioner to Canada, Adeyinka Asekun, dated September 21, 2020.", "Yet\u00a0the Facebook page responsible for the post and calling itself \u201cNigerian High Commission - Ottawa, Canada\u201d was only created on December 5, 2020, more than two months after the stated window period for applications purportedly opened.", "Three images were included in the post, one of them showing what appears to be a signing ceremony. The others show the Nigerian passport and a generic \u201cwelcome to Canada\u201d sign.", "The same claim was also shared here and here.", "Both the post and the page which published it resemble an earlier online hoax claiming the US had opened an E-visa programme for Liberians and Kenyans, debunked here by AFP Fact Check.", "Likewise, the claim that Canada established an E-visa programme for qualifying Nigerians is a fabrication.", "Firstly, there is no online record of Trudeau signing any executive order on migration or electronic visas.", "Then, the first of the images posted alongside the false claim shows Kaycee Madu, a Nigerian-born Canadian who was appointed\u00a0Minister of Justice and Solicitor General of the Canadian province of Alberta in August 2020. The picture had nothing to do with Trudeau signing an executive order -- the prime minister was not even at the ceremony for Madu.", "Thank you, everyone, for all the well wishes. I am beyond humbled to accept my new role as Minister of Justice and Solicitor General - where I will pursue fairness, equality, and justice for all with every ounce of strength I have.

Instead, there are links to its social media channels where the claim has been rejected as false.", "An example is this video on its official Twitter account where High Commissioner Adeyinka Asekun dismisses the claim and highlights irregularities in the post.", "\u201cThere are a number of telltale signs on this particular scheme that a discerning person would have picked up on,\u201d he said, pointing out that the post referenced a \u201cconsular-general\u201d but that \u201cthere is no such person\u201d.", "\u201cIf such a thing were to take place, it would be so big, so major that it will be both on our website and the IRCC [Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada] website, and there probably would be an authentic press release,\u201d Asekun added. \u201cPeople seem to be a little too willing to want to believe this thing, which is absolutely false and fraudulent.\u201d", "AFP Fact Check previously debunked a similar claim on migration after\u00a0Facebook posts alleged that Trudeau had begged Nigeria to send a million immigrants.", "Official migration programmes between the two countries already exist and would not require an executive order.", "The Canadian Federal Skilled Worker programme, a part of the country\u2019s express entry programme, which allows people with sought-after skills or work experience to immigrate to Canada, is very popular in Nigeria.", "In 2019, Canada admitted 8,423 Nigerians into the North American country through its express entry programme, the second-highest admission, just after India.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
