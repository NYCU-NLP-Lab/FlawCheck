We decided to see if the claim that Smith benefited financially from the opioid crisis held any water.", "As evidence of Smith profiting from the opioid crisis, Housley\u2019s campaign sent us financial disclosure forms, pointing to Smith and her husband\u2019s jointly owned stock in Abbott Laboratories of a value between $250,000 and $500,000.", "The Smiths invested in St. Jude Medical, a medical device company, which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017.

Johnson & Johnson is a also a parent company of two companies that have also been sued for marketing opioids. In Smith\u2019s most recent financial report, the income from that stock was between $200 and $1,000.", "Housley claimed Smith profited from the opioid crisis. The idea that the Smiths benefited financially from Abbott Laboratories\u2019 actions a full 14 years before the company acquired St. Jude Medical goes too far. Smith\u2019s husband does hold between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, but it's hard to draw a straight line from that amount of\u00a0stock ownership to \"profiting off the opioid crisis.\"", "Overall, the statement is not accurate.
