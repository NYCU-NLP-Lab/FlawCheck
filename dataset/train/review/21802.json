["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on November 14, 2016", "President-elect Donald Trump repeated an exaggerated claim that there are \u201cprobably 2 million\u201d or \u201ceven 3 million\u201d criminals living illegally in the U.S. One estimate puts the figure at about 820,000.", "Trump made his remarks in an interview with Lesley Stahl on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d It was his first national TV interview since winning the election.", "Lesley Stahl, Nov. 13: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?", "Donald Trump:\u00a0What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we\u2019re getting them out of our country, they\u2019re here illegally.\u00a0After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that you\u2019re talking about who are terrific people. \u2026", "Trump made a similar claim in an Aug. 31 speech in Arizona just hours after meeting with the president of Mexico. At that time, Trump said there are \u201cat least 2 million \u2026 criminal aliens now inside of our country,\u201d citing \u201cfederal data.\u201d", "It is true that a fiscal year 2013 Department of Homeland Security report says: \u201cICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] estimates that 1.9 million removable criminal aliens are in the United States today.\u201d", "But not all of those \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d live in the U.S. illegally.

However,\u00a0the Migration Policy Institute says that most of them are here legally.", "In a July 2015 report, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 820,000 of the 1.9 million are living in the U.S. illegally. Most of those 820,000 people \u2014 about 690,000 \u2014 have been convicted of a felony\u00a0or serious\u00a0misdemeanor that would make them targets for removal under policies adopted by the Obama administration in 2014.\u00a0(See page 25\u00a0of the report.)", "By that measure, most of the 1.9 million \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d came to the U.S. legally via green cards and visas \u2014 not by illegally crossing the southern border.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b35c6da-c617-4511-85b7-250a8ef93f70", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population.
