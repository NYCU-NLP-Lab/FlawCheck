Cuomo said in his State of the State speech Monday in New York City.", "\"Student debt now surpasses credit card debt and consumer debt and more college graduates are living at home than in decades,\" Cuomo said.", "Cuomo\u2019s comment came as part of his push to provide tuition-free public college to students from families earning $125,000 or less each year.

Thirty-six percent of those young adults were living at home in 2014, compared with 35 percent in 1940.
