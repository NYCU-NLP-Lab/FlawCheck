["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on February 27, 2020", "A misleading television ad from the Committee to Defend the President falsely suggests that former President Barack Obama is criticizing his former vice president, Joe Biden, for his racial attitudes.", "The pro-Trump super PAC\u2019s ad begins with an image of Biden and a narrator saying, \u201cJoe Biden promised to help our community. It was a lie. Here\u2019s President Obama.\u201d", "It then segues to Obama reading a passage from his 1995 book \u201cDreams from My Father\u201d about how African Americans have been the victims of \u201cplantation politics.\u201d", "Viewers hear Obama say: \u201cBlack people in the worst jobs, the worst housing. Police brutality rampant. When the so-called black committeeman came around election time, we\u2019d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.\u201d", "While the ad doesn\u2019t say that Obama is talking about Biden, it clearly is aimed at giving the impression that Obama is criticizing his former vice president, now a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. But not only are the words not about Biden, the quotation is not from Obama. He was reading a quote from a character in his book called \u201cSmitty the Barber.\u201d", "The ad is running in several markets in South Carolina, whose Democratic primary will be held Feb. 29. Biden, the onetime Democratic front-runner whose fortunes have faded, desperately needs a win in the Palmetto State.", "On Feb. 26, Obama\u2019s representatives sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Committee to Defend the President demanding that it take down the ads.", "\u201c[T]his unauthorized use of President Obama\u2019s name, image, likeness, voice and book passage is clearly intended to mislead the target audience of the ad into believing that the passage from the audiobook is a statement that was made by President Obama during his presidency, when it was in fact a statement made by a barber in a completely different context more than 20 years ago,\u201d the letter from the law firm Perkins Coie said.", "Ted Harvey, chairman of the Committee to Defend the President, defended the ad.", "\u201cThe Committee has a long history of taking on Joe Biden, beyond Nevada and South Carolina,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPresident Obama made a point in his book about Democrats paying lip-service to the African-American community and we believe his point applies perfectly to Joe Biden.\u201d", "Biden \u201cis simply giving lip-service for votes. That\u2019s the point President Obama made in his book, and we have every right to use his own words \u2014 in his own voice \u2014 in the political forum,\u201d Harvey said.", "As the ad plays audio from the former president, Obama and Biden appear on the screen in separate images along with three headlines \u2014 each referring to a controversy in Biden\u2019s past.", "The first, \u201cJOE BIDEN JOINED SEGREGATIONISTS,\u201d refers to comments the former Delaware senator made last year about how he managed to work with segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia despite their differences. While the comments were meant to show Biden\u2019s ability to work with those with differing views to get things done, they seemed to some to be too warm an embrace of the segregationists. Biden later apologized.", "While the headline refers to an actual incident, it is misleading in that it could be taken to mean that Biden had joined a segregationist group. He did not.", "The second headline, \u201cJOE BIDEN WROTE BILL THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY JAILED AFRICAN AMERICANS,\u201d refers to Biden\u2019s role in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, played a major role in writing the sweeping anti-crime legislation and steering it toward passage.", "The bill in recent years has been heavily criticized for contributing to the widespread incarceration of African Americans. But, as we have written, the law has been given too much blame for the phenomenon. The trend toward increased incarceration began in the early 1970s, and quadrupled in the ensuing four decades. However, experts told us the law exacerbated the trend. For example, the bill included a federal\u00a0\u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision,\u00a0which required mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for those who commit federal violent felonies if they had two or more previous convictions for violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes.", "Biden has pointed out that the legislation was drafted in response to a daunting violent crime problem in the United States at that time.", "The third headline says, \u201cJOE BIDEN BLAMED AFRICAN AMERICAN PARENTS FOR INEQUALITY.\u201d This refers to his response to a question at a Democratic debate last September when he was asked what needs to be done to overcome the legacy of slavery.", "In a rambling answer, Biden said at one point, \u201cWe bring social workers into some and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help, they don\u2019t know what \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do.\u201d He said \u201cvery poor\u201d children will hear 4 million fewer words spoken by the time they get to school and, among other things, he unforgettably urged parents to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on.\u201d", "The Committee to Defend the President has used the Obama passage before, in an anti-Democrat ad on Facebook last year. It was also used by a pro-Trump group, Great American Alliance, in a Georgia congressional race radio ad in 2017.", "Biden has been a particular target of Trump as the campaign general election approaches. In fact, the president\u2019s request for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the former vice president and his son, Hunter, led to his impeachment.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
