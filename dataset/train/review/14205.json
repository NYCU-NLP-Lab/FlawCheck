["About this rating", "On 23 March 2017, an assortment of left-leaning political web sites, including Occupy Democrats and the Palmer Report, published articles reporting that Russian dissident Denis Voronenkov, who was shot dead earlier that same day in Ukraine, was to have been a \"star witness\" in a treason trial involving former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort:", "Yesterday, documents surfaced showing that former Trump Campaign Chair Paul Manafort had received at least $750,000 in illegal payments from former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych, who is about to be tried for treason in absentia in Ukraine.", "Today, Denis Voronenkov was shot to death in the streets of Kiev in broad daylight, just a few weeks after he said he would testify against Yanukovych and his cohorts \u2014 Manafort included.", "This is only the latest in a list of Russian dissidents to be murdered or die under mysterious circumstances since the U.S. Election. The timing of Voronenkov\u2019s murder in conjunction with the latest revelations about Manafort \u2014 a man he was likely to incriminate \u2014 makes this latest tragedy all the more suspect.", "The clear implication was that the purpose of the killing may have been (at least in part) to prevent Voronenkov, a former member of Russia's parliament and Putin critic who fled to Ukraine, from incriminating Manafort at Yanukovych's trial, scheduled to take place in March 2017.", "Mainstream news outlets such as CNN had reported that Voronenkov was indeed cooperating with Ukrainian prosecutors and would be a \"key witness\" against Yanukovych.", "However, we have encountered no evidence that Voronenkov planned to testify about Paul Manafort in any respect. In fact, Voronenkov stated as recently as February 2017 that he knew nothing about Manafort.", "As previously reported, Manafort resigned after serving five months as Donald Trump's campaign manager in August 2016 after handwritten ledgers published in the New York Times indicated he had received $12.7 million in \"illegal\" cash payments (according to Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators) from Victor Yanukovych's Moscow-backed political party between 2007 and 2012. Although Manafort denied receiving such payments, he stepped down from the Trump organization at a moment when it was combating general allegations about ties between the campaign and Russia (as of this writing, those alleged ties are still the subject of an FBI investigation).", "Even so, any imputation of a link between the shooting of Denis Voronenkov and Manafort's dealings with Victor Yanukovych is purely speculative, and indeed contradicts Voronenkov's own public statements in that regard.", "Collinson, Stephen. \u00a0 \"FBI: Trump Campaign, Russia Ties Investigated, No Wiretap Evidence Found.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 21 March 2017.", "Hanna, Jason and Butenko, Victoria. \u00a0 \"Ukraine's Leader Calls Killing of Putin Critic a Russian Terror Act.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 24 March 2017.", "Kramer, Andrew E., McIntire, Mike and Meier, Barry. \u00a0 \"Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump's Campaign Chief.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 14 August 2016.", "McCaskill, Nolan D., Isenstadt, Alex and Goldmacher, Shane. \u00a0 \"Paul Manafort Resigns from Trump Campaign.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Politico.com. \u00a0 19 August 2016.", "Meyers, Steven Lee and Kramer, Andrew E. \u00a0 \"How Paul Manafort Wielded Power in Ukraine Before Advising Donald Trump.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 31 July 2016.", "Nemtsova, Anna. \u00a0 \"Russian Whistleblowers Turn on Putin \u2014\u00a0But Can They Be Trusted?\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Daily Beast. \u00a0 17 February 2017.", "Norton, Sheila. \u00a0 \"Star Witness in Treason Trial Involving Trump's Campaign Chair Was Just Shot Dead.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Occupy Democrats. \u00a0 23 March 2017.", "Palmer, Bill. \u00a0 \"Russian Dissident Shot Dead Who Would Have Been Star Witness in Paul Manafort Trial in Ukraine.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Palmer Report. \u00a0 23 March 2017.", "Roth, Andrew and Gryvnyak, Natalie. \u00a0 \"Days Before His Death, Putin Critic Said in Interview He Knew He Was in Danger.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 23 March 2017.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
