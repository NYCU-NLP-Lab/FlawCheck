A group of political pundits gathers around a table weekdays at 5 p.m. and shouts back and forth on the topics of the day.", "Most are professional pundits, though co-host Dana Perino did serve as press secretary for George W. Bush. And many times, the panel offers some harsh criticism for President Barack Obama.", "On its Halloween episode, co-host Greg Gutfeld broadsided Obama\u2019s health care law and the administration\u2019s sales job.", "Holding a demon puppet he called Seth, Gutfeld said that if Democrats had \"to sell a razor blade\" they\u2019d \"put it in an apple.\"", "\"They got to hide the ugliness of their beliefs,\" Gutfeld said.", "The comment drew a response from liberal co-host Bob Beckel, who made an effort to defend the law and countered that his conservative colleagues were schilling for the insurance industry.", "\"The insurance industry is actually run by mostly Democrats and gave President Obama a lot of \u2026\" Perino jumped in.", "Before she could finish, Beckel groaned, \"Buuulllll \u2026.\" before trailing off himself.", "\"That is true, Bob, and the associations prove it,\" countered Perino.", "Beckel, who wears trademark suspenders, was later seen resting his arms on a pumpkin that had \"single payer\" written on it in marker.", "As fact-checkers, we\u2019ll weigh in on Perino\u2019s point, that the insurance industry is \"run by mostly Democrats.\" We reached out to Perino but didn\u2019t hear back.", "Of course, there is no simple way to determine the political affiliation of the entire health insurance industry.", "We started by checking Perino\u2019s suggestion that health insurance associations prove her claim to be right. The two largest that we could identify are America's Health Insurance Plans and the National Association of Health Underwriters.", "According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tallies political contributions, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans political action committee has contributed about $396,000 to Democrats since 2008 compared to $436,000 to Republicans over the same period of time.", "The CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, Karen Ignagni, has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years -- including Eric Cantor and Josh Mandel on the Republican side and Henry Waxman and Charles Schumer among the Democrats. Ignagni has led health industry groups since 1993 and worked for the AFL-CIO before that.", "We wouldn\u2019t conclude that means the industry is mostly run by Democrats.

(This particular comparison is only modestly helpful, however, as it includes companies that also provide property, life and car insurance.)", "Another way to consider Perino\u2019s claim is to look at the men and women running the largest health insurance companies in the United States.", "Here is a list of some of those companies, the number of people they say they serve, and what we know about the political leanings of the chief executives:", "UnitedHealthcare (70 million people served): The company\u2019s PAC, United For Health, reported that 58 percent of its 2012 federal contributions went to Republicans, while 42 percent went to Democrats. Since 2008, the group has given slightly more to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- $721,000 to Democrats and $704,000 to Republicans. CEO Stephen Hemsley has donated almost solely to Republicans since 2010, including $10,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $5,000 to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.", "Aetna (50 million people served): Aetna\u2019s political action committee reported that it donated $285,500 to Republican candidates in 2012, compared with $170,000 to Democrats.
