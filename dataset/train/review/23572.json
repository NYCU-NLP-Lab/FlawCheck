Scott Walker, the Wisconsin Republican Party faults Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent, for not trying to revoke a teacher's license. (AP)", "With the Aug. 14, 2018 primary election closing in, the Wisconsin Republican Party on Aug. 1, 2018 released radio ads attacking four of the eight Democrats who are running for governor.", "In announcing the ads, the party identified Tony Evers, Matt Flynn, Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Roys as the leading candidates to win the right to challenge GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018.", "The ad attacking Evers, who is the state schools superintendent, claims Evers \"didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls.\"", "An earlier version of the GOP attack, which we fact checked in 2017, rated Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.", "The revised attack does a little better, but still leaves out important context.", "All our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.", "The teacher", "The radio ad alludes to the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. As we reported in the earlier fact check, Harris was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker.", "As the state GOP continued to hammer on the case in 2017, it was later reported that a fellow staff member had told the school district\u2019s investigators Harris also had made crude remarks to staffers about the appearances and chest sizes of female students. However, Evers\u2019 department said neither the department nor the arbitrator could determine whether Harris actually made the sexually crude comments.", "Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris\u2019 behavior did not endanger any students \u00a0\u2014 a key finding, based on state law at the time \u2014 and the decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts.", "The real punch in the Republican Party\u2019s attack, though, is aimed at Evers. So, where does he come in?", "Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.", "Evers\u2019 role", "Evers did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged.", "But Evers decided against seeking revocation after concluding, as the arbitrator did, that the teacher\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t endanger kids, as defined by the law at that time.", "In other words, in the view of Evers\u2019 department, there was no legal basis to take away Harris\u2019 license.\n\nAt the time, state law defined immoral conduct in such cases as \"conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.\"", "After the Harris case, the law was changed so that immoral conduct includes \"the intentional use of an educational agency\u2019s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material.\"", "That is, the part about endangering students was removed, a change that was backed by both Evers and Walker.", "We\u2019re on the 6 p.m. newscasts on WTMJ-TV on Wednesdays and Fridays.", "The state Republican Party says Evers \"didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls.\"", "It\u2019s true that Evers, as the state schools superintendent, opted not to revoke the teacher\u2019s license.", "But what\u2019s left out is that Evers concluded that state law at the time didn\u2019t allow for a revocation because the teacher\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator, who ruled the teacher had been fired improperly and gave the teacher back his job. And two courts upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision.", "The importance of the endangering standard was underlined by the fact that the Legislature later made sure to take that clause out.", "The attack on Evers is partially accurate, but leaves out important details \u00a0\u2014 our definition of Half True.", "YouTube, Wisconsin Republican Party Tony Evers radio ad, Aug. 1, 2018", "Wisconsin Republican Party, news release, Aug. 1, 2018", "Interview, Wisconsin Republican Party research director and lawyer Charles Nichols and spokesman Alec Zimmerman, Aug. 3, 2018", "Email, Tony Evers campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau, Aug. 2, 2018", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Bice: GOP rips Tony Evers for not ousting porn-viewing teacher accused of sexually crude remarks,\" Nov. 2, 2017", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
