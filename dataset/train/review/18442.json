Among other points of criticism was his repeated insistence on referring to the disease as the \"Chinese virus,\" despite widely-accepted public health authority guidelines that warn against naming disease outbreaks after nations or regions of the world, due to the unfounded stigmatization such names can cause.", "The president used that name again during a White House briefing on March 19. Afterwards, social media users shared a photograph purportedly taken at the event, which appeared to show that Trump was even ignoring the guidance of his aides in insisting on referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus.\" Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford tweeted the following:", "Those images were authentic.
