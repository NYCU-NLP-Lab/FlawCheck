This clearly makes it racially insensitive, since it completely ignores Christmases of other colors.", "Students were all too willing to check their privilege and take a stand against Bing Crosby's racially charged micro-aggression.

Second, Joseph had to convince several of the students to sign, prodding them with remarks such as \"You've got to check your privilege, man!\" and \"stop white supremacy in the holiday season.\" Lastly, Joseph claimed that he got 18 signatures in about an hour, which is hardly representative of George Mason University's student body.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
