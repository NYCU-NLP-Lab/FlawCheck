Instead, many WTO member trade with each other via separate trade agreements.", "33,000 people are employed by the European Commission, and 7,500 by the Parliament.", "Roughly correct, although that\u2019s not all staff employed by the EU.

It was 627 at the end of 2018.", "The EU spends \u00a38 billion on overhead each year.", "The EU spent \u00a38.5 billion on administrative costs in 2018.

A lot of the information is, in isolation, broadly correct.", "However the comparison is not particularly helpful because the EU and the WTO are very different organisations in terms of what they do. \u00a0Nor are they two separate and competing \u2018clubs\u2019: both the UK and the EU itself are members of the WTO.", "The WTO sets the basic rules of trade for most countries in the world and acts as a forum for countries to negotiate deals on trade. The WTO does not have institutions and WTO staff provide only technical and professional support to governments, who make the decisions. Countries often have a number of international trade agreements on top of their membership of the WTO.", "The EU is a much more developed political and economic union of 28 countries. As well as setting rules which allow tariff- and barrier-free trade between members, the EU\u2019s remit extends to setting laws and regulations, with its own courts, parliament and civil service. This partly explains why it has more staff and a bigger budget.", "Despite the fact that the comparison isn\u2019t entirely meaningful, let\u2019s look at each of the claims in turn.", "Honesty in public debate matters", "You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email", "I\u2019m in", "It\u2019s correct that there are 28 member states of the EU, including the UK.

It\u2019s not clear what this means, but it probably refers to the fact that EU countries account for 16% of the world\u2019s imports and exports, and WTO members (including the EU) account for 98%.", "But it\u2019s misleading to say 98% of trade happens through the WTO, as the post claims.", "That\u2019s because, while the WTO sets some baseline rules of trade for its members, countries often negotiate trade agreements with one another on top of this, with the aim of creating better terms of trade for both sides. WTO countries without these agreements are said to trade on WTO terms. These are the terms on which the UK would initially trade with most of the world if it had a no deal Brexit.", "So we could reasonably understand trade through the WTO to mean only trade done on WTO terms. Trade done between WTO members via a free trade agreement is not in any meaningful sense done through the WTO, as the rules of that agreement supersede the basic WTO terms of trade.", "By that logic, it\u2019s also not the case that 16% of global trade is done via the EU. Trade is only really done through the EU if it\u2019s two EU countries trading with one another\u2014as this means both sides are governed by the rules of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union. Trade that EU countries do with, for example, the USA is not done through the EU\u2014as EU rules don\u2019t apply to the USA.", "The WTO told us that roughly half of world trade in terms of value is done on WTO terms with no tariffs, another quarter is on WTO terms with tariffs, and the last quarter is done as part of trade agreements.", "However, because some of the trade done via trade agreements is potentially still traded on the same terms as if it was on WTO terms, they estimate that 17% of world trade uses a trade agreement to reduce tariffs.", "So there is a way you could say 83% of world trade is done via the WTO, but not in the way described by the graphic.", "These calculations don\u2019t include any trade between two EU countries (because the WTO treats the EU as a single trading bloc in its calculations).", "And it\u2019s important to note that the amount of trade done on WTO terms varies between different countries. For example, over two thirds of EU member states\u2019 trade is with other EU countries\u2014meaning not on WTO terms. Over half of the UK\u2019s trade is currently not done on WTO terms. A number of major economies also conduct the majority of their trade with the least developed economies using preferential trade agreements.", "Another way to look at it is in terms of how many WTO countries the UK (as an EU member) currently has a trade agreement with. The EU trades with 105 of the 135 other members of the WTO through a trade deal or \u201cpreferential trade agreement\u201d, rather than on WTO terms. No country trades exclusively on WTO terms.", "If the UK left the EU with no deal, it would automatically trade with most countries in the world on WTO terms, meaning increased barriers to trade with many countries.", "The total administrative staff of the European Union is 60,000, higher than the 40,500 claimed in the post.", "The post seems to just add up the staff who work for the European Commission (32,000 people) and the European Parliament (7,500 \u2013 not including the MEPs), and is roughly right about both. But there are a range of other agencies and bodies across the union which is why the total staff is higher than 40,500 as the post suggests.", "The post\u2019s claim that the EU spends \u00a38 billion a year on \u201coverhead\u201d presumably refers to its administrative costs. The EU spent \u00a38.5 billion of its budget on administrative costs in 2018, using the average exchange rate for 2018. That\u2019s around 6% of the EU\u2019s total annual budget.", "In 2018, the WTO employed 627 people, and its total budget for 2019 is around \u00a3160 million (or \u00a30.16 billion) using the exchange rate from January 2019.", "The EU administrative budget will be higher than the WTO\u2019s for a few reasons. The EU has a much larger scope than just dealing with trade regulation. Also the WTO is set up in such a way that requires more direct input from representatives of national governments (rather than, like the EU, having its own institutions and civil servants to carry out business). The relatively small WTO secretariat is limited to providing technical and professional support to governments.", "The WTO\u2019s website states that its founding and guiding principles \u201cremain the pursuit of open borders, the guarantee of most-favoured-nation principle and non-discriminatory treatment by and among members, and a commitment to transparency in the conduct of its activities.\u201d", "The European Union\u2019s website states: \u201cFree trade among its members was one of the EU's founding principles. This is possible thanks to the single market.", "\u201cBeyond its borders, the EU is also committed to liberalising world trade.\u201d", "The European Economic Community (the precursor to the EU) was founded in 1957 as an economic union, which gradually developed wider aims.
