Would it really be Sanders accepting the nomination this week at the DNC if not for superdelegates?", "Superdelegates, if you\u2019ll remember from our primer, are the party officials and bigshots who make up about one-sixth of the delegates in the Democratic Party\u2019s system.

Sanders would not have won the primary without these party insiders.", "The Trump campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but the \"analysis\" he may have been referring to could be a blog post on Gateway Pundit, a conservative newsblog.", "The post\u2019s headline is \"NOTE TO SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Bernie Would Have Won If Not for Super Delegate System!\" It makes a flawed argument that Sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the Clinton superdelegates backed him instead.", "That math checks out on paper, but it is nonsensical in reality. \u00a0The post offers no rationale for why the superdelegates should flip their votes against the popular vote (Clinton won 3.8 million more than Sanders). Experts told PolitiFact Florida that superdelegates could have played a difference if the race was closer.
