Further, the advertisements that said to \"pour salt down your drain tonight, here's why\" led to lengthy stories that never mentioned anything about pouring salt into drains at night.", "What are those online advertisements all about that say to \"pour salt down your drain tonight\"?

Start by pouring half a box of baking soda down your drain. Next, pour half a cup of vinegar down the sink and then stop the drain with a metal stopper \u2014vinegar and baking soda produce a \u201cvolcanic\u201d reaction.
