["After a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, some critics suggested that Joe Biden was mentally unfit for the job of president. Now a viral video has surfaced on social media claiming that Biden said he was unaware of what document he was signing before signing it.", "\"He actually says 'I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m signing here.'\" a Facebook user captioned the viral video, which was shared to Facebook on\u00a0Jan. 27 and has over 1,400 reactions.", "The 42-second video clip shows Biden at a signing ceremony with\u00a0Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.,\u00a0and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., standing behind him. Standing next to\u00a0Biden is Vice President Kamala Harris.", "A text caption near Biden reads, \"I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m signing,\" and a caption below Harris reads, \"Sign it anyways.\"", "USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user for comment.", "Fact check:Meme of 9 questions makes false inauguration claims", "The original video clip, which is visible on VOA News and\u00a0PBS News Hour, shows Biden signing his first documents as president of the United States.
