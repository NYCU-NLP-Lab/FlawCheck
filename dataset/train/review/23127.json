However, its most notable characteristics is the ventral #transparency of some species, especially those of the genus \"#Hyalinobatrachium\".

The image at the top of this article shows that another species of glass frog, Hyalinobatrachium yaku, looks more or less like a \"normal\" frog from other angles.", "In May 2020, a team of researchers determined that this frog's translucent skin likely helps it stay hidden from predators. James Barnett, a frog researcher at McMaster University, said:", "The frogs are always green but appear to brighten and darken depending on the background. This change in brightness makes the frogs a closer match to their immediate surroundings, which are predominantly made up of green leaves. We also found that the legs are more translucent than the body and so when the legs are held tucked to the frog\u2019s sides at rest, this creates a diffuse gradient from leaf colour to frog colour rather than a more salient sharp edge.
