Both city and police union leaders said at the time they had no idea what the future president was talking about.", "That incident came to mind recently when new Mayor Lori Lightfoot brought up during a cable TV interview another spasm of violence over Memorial Day weekend when 41 people were shot and 7 killed.", "In her remarks, Lightfoot sought to draw a connection between the carnage and difficulties she is expected to encounter negotiating a new police contract with the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which represents thousands of rank and file officers.", "\"You know, there were rumors floating around about \u2014 and I didn\u2019t verify this \u2014 but rumors floating around that they were telling their officers, \u2018Don\u2019t do anything. Over Memorial Day weekend, don\u2019t intercede,\" Lightfoot said on CAN-TV\u2019s \"Chicago Newsroom\" program. \"\u2018If you see some criminal activity, just lay back, do nothing.\u2019 I hope to God that wasn\u2019t true because, man oh man, if that happened there\u2019s going to be a reckoning.\"", "Lightfoot made her reputation cracking down on lawless cops, so she and Trump clearly come from very different places when it comes to crime-fighting. Yet the parallel\u00a0between their inflammatory claims was jarring.", "While we are not in the habit of delving into a claim prefaced as rumor, the suggestion from the newly minted mayor that union brass may have told cops not to police cried out for a closer look.", "We weren\u2019t alone in being taken aback by Lightfoot\u2019s assertion. Moments after she leveled it, the show\u2019s host, Ken Davis, asked the mayor whether she bought in to the rumor.", "\"Do you have any reason to believe that that happened?\" Davis asked.", "Without answering directly, Lightfoot contended past leadership of the police union had previously pushed for something similar.", "\"Leading into Labor Day in 2016 when we had this catastrophic level of violence, the then-(union) administration \u2014 which, there are some carryovers from that \u2014 put out a memo telling officers that they should not show up for work, that they shouldn\u2019t do their job, that they shouldn\u2019t be the police,\" she said.", "That exaggerates the record. According to an August 2016 Chicago Tribune story, the union called for officers not to accept overtime requests during Labor Day weekend \u2014 but it said nothing about the officers\u2019 regularly assigned work, as Lightfoot suggested.", "What\u2019s more, that example does not back up the claim Lightfoot made about Memorial Day weekend, which she acknowledged was unverified but chose to publicly repeat nonetheless.", "Like her predecessor, former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Lightfoot opted to boost patrols in an attempt to stem holiday weekend violence, assigning overtime work to an additional 1,200 cops. Her plan also involved offering free programming activities aimed at youth and partnering with religious leaders to help keep the peace.", "It is a lamentable commentary on the chronic state of violence in Chicago that the volume of shootings and deaths over this year\u2019s Memorial Day weekend was little changed from recent years. At the same time, the lack of a surge in mayhem beyond past levels argues against any whispering effort by the FOP to get officers not to do their jobs.", "We followed up with Lightfoot\u2019s office to see if the mayor had corroborated what she\u2019d said about Memorial Day weekend since her TV appearance.", "\"All we can say about this is that the mayor heard it from someone who\u2019s in a position to know and she heard it from a law enforcement source,\" spokeswoman Anel Ruiz told us in a phone interview.", "We also ran Lightfoot\u2019s claim by Kevin Graham, the union\u2019s leader, who said he had no idea what Lightfoot was talking about.", "\"That\u2019s ridiculous,\" he said. \"I am unaware of anyone telling anyone not to do their job.\"", "And we checked with Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th), who chairs the City Council Committee on Public Safety and served as a Chicago police officer for more than 20 years. He told us he had not heard any rumors, much less verified information, to that effect.", "Lightfoot declared in a cable interview that she had heard a rumor about city police union officials \"telling their officers, \u2018Don\u2019t do anything. Over Memorial Day weekend, don\u2019t intercede. If you see some criminal activity, just lay back, do nothing.\u2019\"", "Despite acknowledging that the claim she was sharing had not been verified, Lightfoot chose in her capacity as mayor to amplify it anyway.", "When we followed up, the mayor\u2019s office would not tell us whom she heard it from beyond saying her source was someone in law enforcement. We also checked with the union\u2019s leader and the Chicago alderman who chairs the city\u2019s public safety committee, both of whom said they had no idea what she was referencing.", "Given that neither Lightfoot\u2019s office nor our independent reporting was\u00a0able to verify the rumor the mayor introduced into public discourse, we rate her claim False.", "FALSE\u00a0\u2014 The statement is not accurate.", "Click here\u00a0for more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "\"Donald Trump says a \u2018top police officer\u2019 in Chicago said he could stop surging violence in a week,\" Washington Post, Aug. 23, 2016", "\"41 shot, 7 killed in Memorial Day weekend gun violence,\" Chicago Sun-Times, May 26, 2019", "Video: Lightfoot interview, Chicago Newsroom, May 30, 2019", "\"Chicago police union calls for officers not to work overtime on Labor Day weekend,\" Chicago Tribune, Aug. 31, 2016", "\"New mayor\u2019s strategy for Memorial Day weekend: \u2018flooding the zone\u2019 to keep violence in check,\" Chicago Sun-Times, May 23, 2019", "Phone interview: Anel Ruiz, Lightfoot spokeswoman, June 5, 2019", "Phone interview: Kevin Graham, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7, June 4, 2019", "Phone interview: Ald.
