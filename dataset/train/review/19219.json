["Correction and update May 28, 2019:\u00a0A previous version of this fact-check said that the photo of the two men was manipulated based on the analysis of a photo forensics expert. That determination has since been challenged by other photo forensics experts who say the image is authentic. French publisher AFP has since published a story quoting the men appearing in the photo. The men did not challenge the image's authenticity. We can no longer support the claim that the photo has been manipulated, and have removed that suggestion from this fact-check. The rating of the fact-check, which analyzes the claim that two Muslims were laughing as Notre Dame burned, remains Pants on Fire.
