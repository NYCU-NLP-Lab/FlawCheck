Marco Rubio, R-Fla., makes a point during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the Venetian Hotel & Casino on Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2015, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)", "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went head to head over the government\u2019s bulk phone data collection program at the Dec. 15 Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas.", "The domestic surveillance program allowed the National Security Agency to secretly access the metadata of millions of phone calls; it was made public by government contractor Edward Snowden. Congress curtailed the program and it officially shut down just days before the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Ruibo says it has limited the government\u2019s ability to fight terrorism.", "On the debate stage, Cruz defended his position. He said the replacement law, the USA Freedom Act, not only respects civil liberties by stopping the government from automatically collecting bulk data, but it also expands the government\u2019s ability to gather terrorists\u2019 phone records.", "\"The old program covered 20 to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists,\" Cruz said. \"The new program covers nearly 100 percent. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that\u2019s the case.\"", "Rubio responded, \"Let me be very careful when answering this, because I don\u2019t think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information, so let me just be very clear: There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before.\"", "That\u2019s a pretty stark difference --- Cruz says we\u2019ll have access to many more phone numbers, and Rubio says this bill doesn\u2019t do anything new. We decided to focus on Rubio\u2019s statement.", "Bigger pool, fewer fish", "Prior to the USA Freedom Act, major phone companies like Verizon and AT&T would steadily hand over all of their phone records to the NSA, which maintained a massive database. The records include information like the location of a call, phone numbers involved and the length of the call, but not the content or audio. Intelligence workers could then run a phone number with terrorist ties through the database to find out who they called and when.", "The USA Freedom Act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies. If the government wants to look at a suspected terrorist\u2019s call data, they must first get a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates in secret.", "Interestingly, the old program wasn\u2019t as sweeping as you might have thought. It turns out the NSA only collected about 20 percent of all call data, missing the vast majority of cell phone records, according to intelligence officials and first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. The NSA faced technical challenges in collecting cell phone and Internet phone data, in part due to the major shift away from landlines.", "To remedy this, the new law is \"technology neutral,\" said Jeffrey Vagle, executive director of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Under the law, the NSA can compel any phone company to provide records in whatever format the government desires, per the warrant. Before, there were some limits on how responsive phone companies had to be.", "The law also allows for a much wider breadth of information that the NSA can request; it just can\u2019t collect this data in bulk. To steal an analogy from policy managers at Access Now, a technology advocacy group, \"Basically, there is a bigger ocean they can fish in, but they collect far fewer fish.\"", "So if we are directly comparing the old bulk data collection program to the new program established by the Freedom Act, the government has more tools to access a larger array of records -- cutting against Rubio\u2019s point that \"there is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before.\"", "However, there is a grain of truth to what Rubio is saying: The government always had some ability to obtain cell phone records to a certain extent, just not through the old bulk data collection program, said Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. The main difference now is that the government is working with the carriers to obtain those records more efficiently.", "\"If you're just narrowly comparing the bulk program with its direct replacement, it\u2019s true it will cover more types of records,\" Sanchez said. \"But it's also true that there's no new legal authority to get records that were previously unavailable to the government.\"", "Vagle said it\u2019s possible that the government could have collected cell phone records through existing avenues, such as emergency request approval by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the 1981 Executive Order 12333, which expanded intelligence-gathering abilities. He added that many tech and security experts think the idea that the government only collected 20 percent of phone records is likely an underestimate.", "\"Cruz was correct in comparing the USA Freedom Act to the unmodified Patriot Act (the old bulk collection program),\" Vagle said. \"But if you look at the entire set of tools available to the intelligence community, Rubio was probably correct.\"", "Speaking of Cruz and Rubio together, Sanchez said, \"they\u2019re both sort of right and both sort of wrong.\"", "Our ruling", "Rubio said, regarding the USA Freedom Act, \"There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before.\"", "Rubio was responding to a point by Cruz that the Freedom Act makes it possible for the government to access a much bigger pool of phone records.", "Whereas the old bulk phone data collection program wasn\u2019t very good at collecting cell phone and Internet phone records, the Freedom Act establishes parameters that make this more feasible. However, it\u2019s not like the government couldn\u2019t access these records at all before, they just couldn\u2019t do it through the bulk collection program. The law did not give the government a brand-new legal authority, it just helps to streamline the record collection process.", "We rate Rubio\u2019s claim Half True.", "CNN, Las Vegas debate, Dec. 15, 2015", "National Journal, \"The NSA Could Actually Spy on More Phone Calls Under Reform Bill,\" June 6, 2014", "Washington Post, \"NSA is collecting less than 30 percent of U.S. call data, officials say,\" Feb. 7, 2014", "Wall Street Journal, \"NSA Collects 20% or Less of U.S. Call Data,\" Feb. 7, 2015", "CQ, \"Implementation of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015,\" Nov. 27, 2015", "CQ, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Holds Hearing on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, June 5, 2015", "House Judiciary Committee, \"What\u2019s different in the new bill?\" accessed Dec. 15, 2015", "Christian Science Monitor, \"Opinion: From Internet shutdowns to 'the encryption problem,' rating the Republicans on tech policy,\" Dec. 16, 2015", "Interview, Jeffrey Vagle, executive director of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Dec. 16, 2015", "Email interview, Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, Dec. 16, 2015", "Email interview, Mark Jaycox, legislative analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Dec. 16, 2015", "Email interview, Molly Bishop Shadel, professor and senior fellow at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for National Security Law, Dec. 16, 2015", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
