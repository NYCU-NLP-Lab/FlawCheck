A recent one focuses on guns, declaring:\n\n\"Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds.\"\n\nWhen paired with an image of a handgun and bullets, and the suggestion there would be no limitations, that\u2019s a pretty strong statement.\n\nWould anyone have been able to carry a gun into all of those places?\n\nAs evidence, Sullivan\u2019s campaign points to a series of votes from Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican, in the state Assembly.\n\nThe Vukmir votes were in support of Senate Bill 403, a measure introduced in 2005 that would have allowed individuals to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons. Applicants would have had to complete a firearms safety course or similar training. \u00a0\n\n(At the time, only Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska did not have laws allowing concealed carry; today, only Wisconsin and Illinois don\u2019t permit it.)\n\nThe bill, after being passed by both houses of the Legislature, was vetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle. The Senate voted to override the veto, but an override vote in the Assembly failed. Vukmir voted for the bill and to override Doyle\u2019s veto.\n\nLet\u2019s look at each of the places Sullivan cites and what the bill said about them:\n\nChurches and health care clinics: The owner or authorized representative of a church or clinic could have given permission to a person who has a concealed carry license to bring a concealed weapon inside.\n\nDay care centers: Concealed carry would have been allowed only for the owner of a day care facility and, for day cares operated out of a home, the residents of the home.\n\nPlaygrounds: Concealed carry would have been allowed at parks and playgrounds.\n\nThat means of the four places cited by Sullivan, Vukmir supported allowing a limited number of people into three of the them. In some cases, such as a church or health care center, the pastor or operator would have been able to bar concealed weapons from the building. Only with playgrounds would Vukmir have allowed a wider group -- those who completed training and had received a permit.\n\nSo let\u2019s take stock.\n\nIn a campaign flier, Sullivan says Vukmir, \"supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons\" into day cares, churches and other places. As stated, Sullivan suggests Vukmir wants to allow most anyone to do so. In reality, the bill in question would have been limited to those who obtained permits and -- in three of the four public places described -- applied to a very limited number of people. \u00a0That is an important detail left out.\n\nWe rate Sullivan\u2019s statement Half True.", "National Rifle Association, Right to Carry Laws\n\nSullivan for Senate campaign literature on concealed carry\n\nWisconsin Assembly, amendment on parks and playgrounds, Dec. 13, 2005\n\nWisconsin Assembly, vote to table amendment on parks and playgrounds, Dec. 13, 2005\n\nWisconsin Assembly, amendment on child care centers, Dec. 13, 2005\n\nWisconsin Assembly, vote to table amendment on child care centers, Dec. 13, 2005\n\nWisconsin 2005 Senate Bill 403 (the version voted on), Dec. 5, 2005\n\nWisconsin Assembly, vote on 2005 Senate Bill 403, Dec. 14, 2005\n\nWisconsin Assembly, vote to override veto of Senate Bill 403, Jan. 31, 2006\n\nWisconsin Legislative Council, Amendment Memo, 2005 Senate Bill 403\n\nWisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, Concealed Weapon Laws in the States, April 2006\n\nWisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, Firearm Laws in Wisconsin, December 2008", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
