["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on July 24, 2020", "A viral video misrepresents scientific papers and the reasons for wearing face masks to claim that they are ineffective in mitigating transmission of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that masks may help prevent the spread of the disease.", "A video pushing misinformation about face masks racked up hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook and YouTube, before the latter removed it for violating the platform\u2019s community standards.", "It begins with a promise to answer these questions:", "\u201cIn our highly politicized climate, it seems like everybody has to be on some kind of team\u2026 If we set aside feelings and we just look at facts, what do facts say about wearing a face mask?\u00a0 What does science say about face masks and whether or not they prevent the spread of viruses like COVID-19?\u201d", "But it doesn\u2019t report either facts or science.", "Right from the start, in that introduction, the video gets it wrong \u2014 COVID-19 isn\u2019t a virus. Rather, it\u2019s the disease that is caused by the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.", "More importantly, contrary to its claim that it would cut through the politics of wearing masks, the video actually goes on to misrepresent several scientific papers in an effort to support the claim that wearing a face mask is useless, or worse, that its use is harmful to the wearer.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained that face coverings are meant to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by containing respiratory droplets created when people cough, sneeze or talk. That\u2019s called source control. The CDC has also noted that masks shouldn\u2019t be worn if they are likely to cause harm, and it has said not everyone will be able to wear one.", "That\u2019s been the recommendation of the CDC since early April, when the agency changed\u00a0its original position on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing new studies on the transmission of the novel coronavirus.", "We\u2019ve written numerous stories explaining the guidance and correcting misinformation on the issue.", "Despite all that, misinformation about masks persists. This video is a particularly polished example since it is produced to look like a television news segment. It\u2019s presented by Ben Swann, a television journalist who won regional Emmy Awards in 2005 and 2009. But Swann has more recently been featured as the co-host of a show called Boom Bust on the Russia-based, government-funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today, and he has made videos pushing conspiracy theories. The video was produced by Swann\u2019s website, called Truth In Media.", "In this video, Swann starts off by citing seven scientific papers. He incorrectly refers to them all as \u201cstudies,\u201d but only two of them are studies, while the rest are reviews. Reviews are often more comprehensive than individual studies since they provide an overview of a scientific issue by analyzing relevant studies, although they don\u2019t provide new facts or findings of their own.", "After listing the papers, Swann says: \u201cAll of these are RTCs, randomized controlled tests, that are essentially set up to determine whether or not these N95 respirator masks help to prevent the spread of viruses in this setting, and all of these studies found that they do not.\u201d", "Not only is it wrong to say they are all RTCs, or randomized clinical trials \u2014 as we said, five of them are reviews of those types of studies \u2014 it\u2019s also wrong to characterize their findings that way.", "One of the\u00a0studies and two of the\u00a0reviews he cites looked at how N95 masks compared to surgical masks in protecting health care workers from getting sick, and the rest of them, similarly, mostly examined how masks generally performed in protecting health care workers from disease.", "It\u2019s important to note that nearly all of the studies covered in the reviews were dealing with the use of masks by health care workers, who have more exposure to infected patients than the general public. They also focused on protection from infection, not source control.", "Swann then claimed: \u201cIn the 2019 study, there was no significant difference by wearing N95 respirator masks. Happened again in 2020.\u201d", "But the 2019\u00a0study looked at the effect of N95 respirators compared to surgical masks to prevent health care workers from getting the flu and \u201cother viral respiratory infections in geographically diverse, high-exposure, outpatient settings.\u201d It did not examine the use of masks as source control for containing the spread of a virus in the general population. It also didn\u2019t include a group of study subjects who didn\u2019t wear masks at all, so the outcomes of those who wore surgical masks or N95 respirators can\u2019t be compared to outcomes for non-mask wearers.", "The 2020 \u201cstudy\u201d is actually a\u00a0review that includes the 2019 study along with five other similar studies, looking largely at the effect of masks in protecting health care workers from getting sick.", "That review included only one study that wasn\u2019t focused on health care workers. Published in 2009, that study looked at the use of masks in households with a sick child and found that if masks aren\u2019t used regularly and correctly, they won\u2019t be effective in controlling the spread of seasonal viruses. \u201cHowever,\u201d the study found, \u201cduring a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced.\u201d", "As we\u2019ve written before, there have been relatively few studies looking at the efficacy of face masks on the\u00a0 public, and the ones that have been done are inconsistent or have not observed large effects.", "Swann goes on to claim (emphasis added): \u201cThere\u2019s another study that was also done in 2020. It was done by a group of researchers in Hong Kong. The study was conducted just before COVID-19 hysteria took over and the results of it were released just a few weeks ago and, once again, those researchers found the very same thing: that there was, in fact, no statistical reason to believe that face masks will protect you, but improper use of a face mask actually puts you at greater risk of contamination.\u201d", "Again, this was a review of previously completed studies, not a new study, and it looked largely at how effective various methods\u00a0 \u2014 including wearing a mask, hand hygiene, covering coughs and sneezes, and cleaning surfaces \u2014 would be in responding to an influenza pandemic. The review did include studies of face masks used for source control, but found that \u201c[m]ost studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group.\u201d", "The researchers also said, \u201cWe did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility. However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.\u201d", "Swann released a follow-up video about a week after the original and relied heavily on this paper, claiming that it\u00a0\u201cproves that face masks do not prevent the spread of a virus.\u201d", "But one of the researchers who worked on the paper, Benjamin Cowling, told us by email, \u201cIt is wrong to say that our review said there was no effectiveness of face masks. We could only rule out very large effects.\u201d", "Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, explained that, \u201cwhile we said there was not a significant effect, we could not exclude the possibility that masks reduce transmission by 10% or 20%. Those would be useful effect sizes.\u201d", "He also noted on Twitter that he and his colleagues worked with the World Health Organization in 2019 to come up with guidelines for mitigating pandemic influenza. Those guidelines recommend wearing a mask in \u201csevere epidemics or pandemics.\u201d", "As for the claim that using a mask improperly could \u201cput you at greater risk of contamination,\u201d that possibility is mentioned in one sentence in the paper, which cites interim guidance from the WHO to address the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. That two-page WHO paper doesn\u2019t explain what that caution is based on, but it does lay out best practices for wearing masks in the general public, saying:", "If masks are worn, proper use and disposal is essential to ensure they are potentially effective and to avoid any increase in risk of transmission associated with the incorrect use of masks. The following information on correct use of masks derives from the practices in health-care settings:", "Swann next builds on his claim about contamination, saying (emphasis added): \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been told, over and over, is that if you just wear a cloth mask over your face, it\u2019s better than nothing, so you should do that. And, so, because of that, we have tens of millions of people walking around with cloth masks on their face. Now, get this, in 2015, there was actually a study done taking a look at medical masks versus just a cloth mask and whether or not wearing a cloth mask would protect against the spread of a virus and what that study found in 2015 should alarm you. Not only does wearing a cloth mask not prevent the spread of a virus, it can actually put you at greater risk for catching the virus.\u201d", "Again, this study did not look at the effect of masks as source control in slowing the spread of a virus, which is the reason the CDC recommends wearing them. Like most of the other papers cited in this video, it looked at how effective masks were in keeping health care workers from getting sick. And, like the 2019 study, it didn\u2019t include a group who wore no masks, so it couldn\u2019t say whether or not cloth masks might provide more protection than no mask at all.", "The study did find that \u201c[m]oisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.\u201d But it said that \u201c[f]urther research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.\u201d", "Also, the authors of that study released a statement this year to clarify questions about their 2015 findings in relation to COVID-19. They noted the shortage of personal protective equipment and explained that, in their study conducted in Vietnam, the cloth masks may not have been washed well enough and that the effectiveness of a mask could change depending on the material and the number of layers used.", "On top of that, Raina MacIntyre, who was lead researcher on that study, clarified to FactCheck.org in an email, \u201cThe findings of the study are not translatable to the community, or to all cloth masks.\u201d", "MacIntyre, who heads the biosecurity program at the University of New South Wales\u2019 Kirby Institute, went on to say, \u201cThere is also the matter of source control, which is preventing outward transmission from an infected person. A face covering provides a physical barrier.\u201d She stressed that reusable masks have to be cleaned after every use.", "Swann next made this sweeping claim: \u201cWearing a face mask on a regular basis is unhealthy for you and there are multiple studies that show that.\u201d", "That\u2019s based entirely on an article written by Dr. Russell Blaylock, who has pitched several dubious claims over the years and writes an alternative medicine newsletter. Swann focused on the section of the Blaylock article that said health care workers have reported getting headaches with prolonged use of personal protective equipment, which is backed up by two studies cited in Blaylock\u2019s article. Those studies looked at health care workers who wore N95 masks for hours at a time, not shoppers wearing a cloth face covering to go to the grocery store.", "Swann also read from another section of Blaylock\u2019s article, paraphrasing it this way: \u201cThere\u2019s another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if you\u2019re wearing it for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of that virus with each breath. But if you\u2019re wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask, you\u2019re breathing back in the virus every time you attempt to expel it.\u201d", "Swann doesn\u2019t explain what he means, but it sounds like a claim we debunked when it was made in the viral video called \u201cPlandemic\u201d that filled social media feeds in May. In that video, Judy Mikovits, a\u00a0former chronic fatigue researcher, claimed: \u201cWearing the mask literally activates your own virus. You\u2019re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d", "Experts we talked to at the time said her claim didn\u2019t hold up. Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, told us then, \u201cIf you\u2019re shedding (breathing out) virus, then you\u2019re already infected. Even without a mask, infected people who are shedding virus probably rebreathe some of their own viruses, but there are already billions times more viruses in your body. Hopefully, the mask is protecting other people from your exhalations.\u201d", "Also, the fact-checking organization Science Feedback addressed the same Blaylock article that Swann cited, debunking the claim that wearing a mask concentrates \u201cexhaled viruses\u201d in the nose, which sends them to the brain. Science Feedback called it \u201cunsupported and illogical.\u201d They wrote: \u201cIf someone is exhaling the virus, then they are already infected. The spread of the infection would be largely determined by how well the person\u2019s immune system fights off the infection, not by whether they inhaled virus particles that they previously exhaled.\u201d", "Swann wrapped up the video with a misrepresentation aimed at Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.", "\u201cEven the biggest doctor of them all in this country, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who keeps talking about this issue, referred to wearing a face mask as mostly symbolic. Listen to his words \u2014 he called it, \u2018mostly symbolic,'\u201d Swann said.", "Here\u2019s what\u00a0Fauci actually said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d: \u201cI wear it for the reason that I believe it is effective. It\u2019s not 100% effective. I mean, it\u2019s sort of, respect for another person and have that person respect you \u2014 you wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other. I mean I do it when I\u2019m in the public for the reasons, A) I want to protect myself and protect others and also I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that\u2019s the kind of thing you should be doing.\u201d", "Regardless of Fauci\u2019s real message, Swann used his twisted version of it to draw the conclusion that the recommendation to wear face masks is not about public health, but about the \u201csubmission of the public.\u201d Looking at the camera, Swann asked, \u201cAre we being forced to submit merely because politicians want us to?\u201d", "Like his bogus claims based on misrepresentations of scientific papers, that claim is based on a misrepresentation of Fauci\u2019s statement. Swann offered no further support for it.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
