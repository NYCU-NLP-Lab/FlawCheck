["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on March 3, 2020", "Democratic presidential candidates harshly criticized President Donald Trump for using the term \u201choax\u201d in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. There\u2019s no question that the president described the disease as the Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax\u201d at a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina.", "But the following day, after the death of the first American from coronavirus in Washington state, Trump said that when he used the word \u201choax,\u201d he was referring to Democrats finding fault with his administration\u2019s response to coronavirus, not the virus itself.", "Even after Trump explained his remarks, some Democrats \u2014 including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg \u2014 continued to wrongly accuse Trump of describing the coronavirus as a \u201choax.\u201d", "The kerfuffle began at the rally in North Charleston, South Carolina when Trump accused the Democrats of \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the coronavirus outbreak.", "\u201cNow the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right?\u201d he said. \u201cCoronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa.\u201d", "Then the president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as a hoax, continued, \u201cThey tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.\u201d", "Trump went on to praise his administration for taking \u201cthe most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States,\u201d referring to travel restrictions on foreign nationals who recently visited China.", "\u201cA virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn\u2019t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand the Democrats\u2019 single talking point, and you see it, is that it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault, right?\u201d", "Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Trump\u2019s \u201choax\u201d remark. Former Vice President Joe Biden described the president\u2019s comments as \u201cabsolutely bizarre\u201d", "\u201cLook, this is a serious, serious problem,\u201d Biden told MSNBC on Feb. 29. \u201cIt\u2019s able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It\u2019s just not a decent way to act.\u201d", "Biden told reporters in Greenville, South Carolina, on Feb. 29 \u201cThe president of the United States says it\u2019s a hoax? It\u2019s hard to believe. Even for him it\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d", "Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, at the time still a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, also said he was troubled by Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201choax.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s critically important that the administration and the White House handle this in a way that\u2019s based on science and not based on politics,\u201d Buttigieg said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show on Feb. 29. \u201cI was particularly disturbed to hear the word \u2018hoax\u2019 used by the president recently in talking about this issue.\u201d", "Buttigieg ended his run for the White House on March 1.", "In the wake of the criticism, Trump said at a press conference on Feb. 29 that he used the term \u201choax\u201d to refer not to coronavirus itself but to Democrats\u2019 criticism of how his administration had responded to it.", "Asked if he regretted using that particular word, he replied \u201cNo. No. No. Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we\u2019ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them not\u2026 I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here. I\u2019m talking what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax. That\u2019s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it\u2019s the impeachment hoax or the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. This is what I\u2019m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff\u2026\u201d", "But that hardly put an end to criticism from Democrats.", "In an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on March 1, Bloomberg said, \u201cI find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [Friday] night in South Carolina.\u201d", "Correspondent Scott Pelley responded, \u201cHe said that the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.\u201d", "And Bloomberg shot back, \u201cThis is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world would say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, \u2018We don\u2019t know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.'\u201d", "A day later, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, similarly criticized Trump at a Biden rally on March 1 in Norfolk, Virginia.", "\u201cWe got a guy in the White House who doesn\u2019t know anything about patriotism, doesn\u2019t know anything about empathy,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cHe said the coronavirus was a hoax.\u201d", "But that\u2019s not what Trump said he meant.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
