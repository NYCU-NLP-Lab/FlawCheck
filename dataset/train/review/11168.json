["Social media users were up in arms after R&B artist Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg tweeted about the raging farmer protests in India. While one group appreciated their support, the other felt they were \u2018interfering\u201d in India\u2019s internal matters. Responding to the tweets by Rihanna, Greta, and some other prominent international celebrities, the Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement instructing foreigners not to comment on the farmers\u2019 movement.
