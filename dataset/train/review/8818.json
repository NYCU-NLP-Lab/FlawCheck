Corporations and the highest earners would be hit hardest.", "An ad from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign takes former Vice President Joe Biden out of context three times, falsely claiming that Biden repeatedly told voters he plans to raise their taxes.", "The 30-second ad deceptively edits remarks that Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee,\u00a0made at separate campaign events in South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio, omitting critical context in each case that would leave a different impression about what he said.", "\"An economy in ruins,\" the ad concludes. \"That's what Joe Biden's tax increase means for you.\"", "The ad ran on TV as recently as Oct. 21. It resembles a similar spot released Sept. 16, which also cut Biden\u2019s South Carolina remarks out of context and made claims about his tax plan.", "But Biden and his campaign have been clear throughout the campaign that he intends to focus any direct tax increases on the wealthiest people and corporations.", "Biden has repeatedly pledged to avoid raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 per year. Independent tax analysts who assessed Biden\u2019s plan in the spring and summer of 2020 agreed that it does not call for direct tax increases on anyone below that threshold.", "Some lower earners could see small hits to their after-tax incomes due to the indirect effects of Biden\u2019s proposed increase to the corporate tax rate, the early tax analyses said.

But that\u2019s not what he said.", "The full context shows Biden was addressing one person who indicated moments earlier that he or she had benefited from the tax bill that became law under Trump.

I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing well already,\" Biden said, directly addressing that person in the audience. \"But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.\"", "How the ad quotes Biden: \"And here\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m going to raise taxes.\"", "The missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 10 campaign event in Erie, Pa.

I\u2019m going to raise taxes,\" Biden said. \"I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand. But you won\u2019t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I\u2019m going to ask them to finally begin to pay their fair share. I\u2019m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay.\"", "How the ad quotes Biden: \"You\u2019re going to get a tax raise.\"", "The missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 12 campaign event in Toledo, Ohio. The Trump campaign ad again omits key portions of Biden\u2019s remarks. The full context shows he was talking about raising taxes on people with taxable incomes over $400,000 per year.", "\"I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year,\" Biden said. \"If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you\u2019re going to get a tax raise. Well, I\u2019m going to raise your tax slightly, if you\u2019re making over 400. But look, you\u2019re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle-class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most. Raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement. But I\u2019m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share.
