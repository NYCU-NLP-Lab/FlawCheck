During his tenure, street homelessness decreased by 28% and more than 170,000 affordable homes were built or preserved,\" his site states.", "We were curious about Bloomberg\u2019s claim about \"street homelessness,\" and reached out to the campaign. Spokesman Michael Frazier directed us to a city report from 2013.", "According to the Mayor\u2019s Management Report, \"the estimate of those living on the street in 2013 is 28 percent lower than the baseline established in 2005.\"", "Street homelessness is a portion of the total number of people who are homeless. The city considers people who sleep on the streets or in the\u00a0parks\u00a0or subway system to be part of this subset. It does not include the much larger number of people in the city\u2019s shelters.", "The Bloomberg administration began counting people who are part of the\u00a0street homeless population in 2005.\u00a0Data from the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services show a 28 percent drop in the number of people who slept on the streets or in the parks and subway during annual point-in-time counts between 2005 and 2013. On March 7, 2005, volunteers counted 4,395 street homeless people for the inaugural Homeless Outreach Population Estimate, or HOPE count.

Corinth wrote that \"street counts are inherently difficult to conduct and should therefore be treated cautiously.\"", "Giselle Routhier, policy director for Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy organization that has been critical of Bloomberg, said that the shelter census is a better measure.", "\"We never trust the HOPE estimate,\" Routhier said. The count could be influenced by various factors, such as the weather. Counters can also miss homeless people on the street because they may not always be in publicly visible places, such as an ATM vestibule, and efforts to get people off the street in the week before the annual count can affect the result, she said.", "New York City provides temporary emergency shelter to every eligible man, woman, and child, every night. This means that many of the city's homeless are in shelters, not on the street, Routhier said.", "While the street homeless population has fluctuated between 2,328 and 4,395 since 2005, according to the HOPE counts, the shelter population surpassed 50,000 under Bloomberg.", "Other homelessness experts gave Bloomberg mixed report cards on his efforts, even as some said that his claim of reducing street homelessness is correct.", "Thomas J.
