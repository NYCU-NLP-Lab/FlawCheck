Martha McSally, Kelly said that McSally supports a border wall that is too costly and a \"17th century solution\" for border security. The federal government should invest in technology and more border patrol agents \u2014 and not take money away from a military base in Arizona, he said.", "\"Senator McSally voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall,\" Kelly said during a debate with McSally in Phoenix Oct. 6.", "Is that true?

Funding for the Arizona project was deferred, not scrapped entirely.", "Citing an \"invasion\" crisis, Trump in February 2019 declared a national emergency at the southwest border, a move that led his administration to redirect funds from planned Defense Department projects to construction at the border. \"Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis,\" Trump\u2019s declaration said.", "Trump\u2019s declaration came after he was unable to get money from Congress to pay for his promised border wall.

A contract for the Arizona project was expected to be awarded May 2020. Congress would need to backfill the money being diverted, the Defense Department said.", "Kelly\u2019s campaign pointed to three votes McSally cast in 2019 supporting Trump\u2019s declaration.", "McSally in March voted against a resolution seeking to end Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration.
