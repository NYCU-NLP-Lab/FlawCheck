Viktor Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015.", "Many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of the ruling class. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director warned in early 2016 that \"without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful\" in Ukraine.", "A frustrated Biden in December 2015 threatened that the United States would withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law.

Zlochevsky had faced accusations of financial wrongdoing for some time. In 2014, the British government froze $23 million in his bank accounts in England, though the court later ordered them unfrozen, suspecting him of laundering money that belonged to Ukrainian taxpayers.", "The American ambassador to Ukraine criticized Shokin\u2019s office and said it never sent the British the records it needed to make its case against Zlochevsky. Worse, the ambassador said, Shokin\u2019s office told Zlochevsky\u2019s lawyers \"that there was no case against him.\"", "A Ukraine court seized Zlochevsky\u2019s homes and a Rolls Royce.

But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant.
