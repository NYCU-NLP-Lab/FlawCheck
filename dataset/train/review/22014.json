However, the photograph is a fake on multiple levels.", "First of all, the nude portrait of Donald Trump seen here is not something the GOP hopeful commissioned or posed for.  It's a sort of commentary\" titled \"Make America Great Again\" created by artist Illma Gore, who never saw Trump in the altogether:", "\"Make America Great Again\" was created to evoke a reaction from its audience, good or bad, about the significance we place on our physical selves. One should not feel emasculated by their penis size or vagina, as it does not define who you are.

One of the participants inserted the\u00a0painting\u00a0of Trump into the\u00a0original image, and the results were soon spread widely across the Internet.", "Finally, the photograph of President Obama pointing to works incorporating\u00a0Beavis and Butthead characters, on which the Trump-version manipulation was based, has been disclaimed as well. Vincent Torres, the director of the Austin-area Guzu Gallery, averred that he created it to promote a series of art prints:", "An Austin area art gallery gets into Obama fever.  The 'Guzu Gallery' is home to collectable art, collectible vinyl toys, art books, graphic novels, and Photoshop masters.", "Guzu Gallery Director Vincent X Torres is responsible for the altered image.  He wanted to promote his 'Half Human' series of art prints and posted the image to Guzu's Facebook page.", "The Guzu Gallery also hinted on Facebook that the image was not real:", "In other words, an artist's imagined take\u00a0of Donald Trump's naked body was Photoshopped into an image which itself was a digitally manipulated\u00a0photographed created to promote an art gallery exhibit:", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
