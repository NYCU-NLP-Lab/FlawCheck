["According to the description on YouTube, Dr Soumya Swaminathan \u201caddresses the world in a promotional video\" about the safety of vaccines. But it then accuses her of hypocrisy: \"Five days later, here is her diametrically different opinion behind closed doors at the Global Vaccine Safety Summit,\" which took place in Geneva, Switzerland.", "The video was shared on Facebook in the United States here,\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.", "Swaminathan, a pediatrician, has served on several WHO advisory committees and is a globally recognized researcher on tuberculosis and HIV.", "She spoke on December 3, 2019, the second day of the summit. Comparing the full video of her speech, available here, to the footage posted on YouTube, it is clear that a section has been cut.", "Swaminathan's remarks were addressed to other WHO experts, with the apparent aim of improving communication and public knowledge about the introduction of new vaccines.", "She spoke for about five minutes at the Geneva event.", "The misleading video splices a WHO clip of Swaminathan discussing the safety of vaccines with footage from her Geneva comments.", "It opens with the doctor saying that \u201cvaccines are very safe,\u201d then moves at 1\u201930\u201d to video of her speaking in Geneva: \u201cI think we cannot overemphasize the fact that we really don\u2019t have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries, and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we\u2019re not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to a particular vaccine, and this always gets blown up in the media.\u201d", "At 2\u201907\u2019\u2019 in Swaminathan\u2019s remarks, there is a sudden cut in the video.", "Although the next sentence is presented as a continuation, it actually occurred later. The edited video leaves out 35 seconds of her comments, between 29\u201950\u2019\u2019 and 30\u201925,\u2019\u2019 in which she stresses the need for better communication and transparency about new vaccines.", "In the removed section, Swaminathan does not appear to be doubting the safety of vaccines, but rather the effectiveness of public information campaigns about their implementation.", "The video\u2019s claim that Swaminathan spoke to officials \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d is also false. The full Geneva conference remains available on the official WHO website.", "Earlier in the WHO chief scientist\u2019s full remarks, around 25\u201920,\u2019\u2019 she calls vaccine skeptics and critics \u201cvery, very damaging.\u201d As an example, she points to the HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine in India, where implementation was delayed by more than a decade because of misinformation about the immunization.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
