["About this rating", "As a series of hurricanes made landfall in August and September 2017, those living in the affected areas have been searching for a communication tool that would enable them to send messages in the event of a service outage.", "An app called \"FireChat\" is one of the most widely suggested tools, due to its purported ability to send messages without an internet connection:", "\u200bWhen no Internet connection or cellular networks are available, FireChat uses the radios inside our phones to connect them directly with one another. In that case (which is also called \"offline\" or \u201coff-the-grid\u201d), messages will travel up to 70 meters (210 feet) from one phone to the next.", "\u200bIf there are more than two devices, they will form a network and messages will bounce from one device to the next, thus extending the range of the network. The more people use FireChat, the better the network gets for everybody. This is why FireChat works really well for very large groups of people.", "In other words, FireChat wouldn't be able to send a text message from Miami, Florida to Seattle, Washington (a distance of more than 3,000 miles) unless an unbroken chain of tens of thousands of FireChat users spanned that distance. However, it can be used to send messages within a community of FireChat users without the Internet:", "What's unique about FireChat is that it also works when there is no Internet connection or cellular phone coverage. It even works on a plane. When your community gets together, it creates your own free communication network and doesn\u2019t rely on traditional networks.", "You don't have to do anything special: just keep FireChat on your smartphone and keep Bluetooth and WiFi on (yes, even if there is no Internet access). This is game-changing since you can create local communication networks at zero cost and also stay connected during sports games, rallies, music festivals, and in emergency situations.", "The MIT Technology Review explained more about how the app works in an article that was published shortly after FireChat's initial release in 2014:", "FireChat makes use of a feature Apple introduced in the latest version of its iOS mobile software, iOS7, called multipeer connectivity. This feature allows phones to connect to one another directly using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi as an alternative to the Internet. If you\u2019re using FireChat, its \u201cnearby\u201d chat room lets you exchange messages with other users within 100 feet without sending data via your cellular provider.", "Micha Benoliel, CEO and cofounder of startup Open Garden, which made FireChat, says the app shows how smartphones can be set free from cellular networks. He hopes to enable many more Internet-optional apps with the upcoming release of software tools that will help developers build FireChat-style apps for iPhone, or for Android, Mac, and Windows devices. \u201cThis approach is very interesting for multiplayer gaming and all kinds of communication apps,\u201d says Benoliel.", "Christophe Daligault, the vice president of sales and marketing for the app, told NPR that it works on a \"mesh\" network:", "Mesh networks can be used to set up temporary networks in disaster zones, and even to spread the Internet to remote areas beyond the reach of existing wireless networks and cables. That's the technology that Google and Facebook are counting on for their plans of spreading the Internet across the globe with balloons and drones.", "[...]", "\"Once you build a mesh network ... now you have a network that is resilient, self-healing, cannot be controlled by any central organization, cannot be shut down and is always working,\" Daligault says. \"I think that solves many other drawbacks or challenges of the mobile broadband Internet today.\"", "He says none of this would be possible without the rapid spread of smartphones, because that means no extra hardware is needed.", "\"Each [phone] becomes a router and in a sense you're growing the Internet \u2014 everyone who joins the mesh network creates an extension of the Internet,\" Daligault says. \"In a year or two from now, I think people won't even remember that you had to be on Wi-Fi or get a cell signal to be able to communicate.\"", "The FireChat app can send messages without Internet service as stated. However, the app does some have limitations. Potential users, especially those searching for an emergency communication tool to use during a natural disaster, should visit the FireChat home page to make sure that they understand how the app works:", "The messaging app Zello was also widely suggested for emergency communications in September 2017. Although there are several benefits to that particular app during an emergency (it is billed as a \"walkie-talkie\" app), Zello does not work without the internet.", "Toor, Amar. \u00a0 \"This App Lets Rescue Workers Send Offline Alerts When Disaster Strikes\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Verge. \u00a0 19 May 2016.", "Yu, Alan. \u00a0 \"How One App Might Be A Step Toward Internet Everywhere.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NPR. \u00a0 7 April 2014.", "Simonite, Tom. \u00a0 \"The Latest Chat App for iPhone Needs No Internet Connection.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 MIT Technology Review. \u00a0 28 March 2014.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
