["An alleged screenshot from a broadcast by news channel Aaj Tak has been making the rounds on social media the last few days. The Hindi headline in the viral image shows a purported statement by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath which reads, \u201cThakurs are hot-headed, they can make mistakes.\u201d A Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four Thakur men in Hathras last month. The purported quote attempts to show the CM\u2019s support to the accused. It is noteworthy that the alleged rape has sparked massive outrage in the country but there are also reports of hundreds of people from the Thakur community staging a counter-protest in support of the accused and demanding justice for them.", "\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0930\u0938 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0919\u093e \u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0924 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0938\u0940 \u0918\u093e\u091f \u092a\u0930 \u0932\u0919\u0915\u0940 \u091b\u0947\u0919 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0925\u093e \u0932\u0919\u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0939\u0938 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0925\u0940 \u0932\u0919\u0915\u0940 \u0928\u0947 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u094b \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0924\u092e\u093e\u091a\u093e\u2026", "Posted by \u0938\u0948\u092b\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 on Saturday, 3 October 2020", "The screengrab is viral on Facebook.", "Congress leader Udit Raj also attributed the statement to Adityanath however, sans the Aaj Tak screenshot.

The background colour behind the headline is also different. There are certain formatting issues which would otherwise not be present in a genuine broadcast.
