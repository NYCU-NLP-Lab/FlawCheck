["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 26, 2021 | Updated on February 10, 2022", "Federal officials authorized two mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 after they were determined to be safe and effective against symptomatic illness in clinical trials. But a Texas doctor, in a widely shared video, falsely claims the vaccines don\u2019t provide protection and that they\u2019re actually \u201cexperimental gene therapy.\u201d", "No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.", "One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d", "Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.", "Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.", "For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever.", "Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain and chills. These reactions are more likely after the second dose of those vaccines, given several weeks after the first, and are more common and severe in younger people. The Johnson & Johnson side effects, too, were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants, and also included nausea.", "As the CDC explains, these common side effects are normal signs that your body is beginning to mount an immune response and the symptoms should go away within several days. Some people have no side effects, and that is normal, too.", "Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccines may cause more serious problems.", "For more information on these rare adverse events, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d", "Link to this", "Update, Aug. 23, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval\u00a0from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.", "Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received\u00a0full approval\u00a0from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years of age and older.", "In a video shared widely on social media, a Texas doctor known for his political activism \u2014 and whose vitamin sales prompted a warning by federal officials \u2014 is peddling a host of false claims to try to discourage people from getting vaccinated against COVID-19.", "Dr. Steven Hotze implores viewers to \u201cjust say no\u201d to the vaccines, after a long, error-filled pitch that baselessly alleges that the mRNA vaccines aren\u2019t actually vaccines at all.", "As we\u2019ve explained in previous SciCheck stories, two vaccines currently authorized for use in the U.S., from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are designed using modified messenger RNA. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make spike proteins that then trigger an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. (See\u00a0\u201cA Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine\u201d and \u201cA Guide to Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine.\u201d)", "Hotze is a conservative activist who unsuccessfully challenged COVID-19 public health measures in Texas last year\u00a0and who made unproven allegations about voter fraud ahead of the 2020 election. In December, the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission sent Hotze a letter warning him to stop selling his line of vitamins by using misleading suggestions that they could treat or prevent COVID-19.", "His video focusing on mRNA vaccines was published on his website Feb. 26. The link to that post has been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. The video has also been viewed tens of thousands of times across various posts on Facebook and Instagram.", "We reached out to Hotze about some of his claims in the video and didn\u2019t hear back. We\u2019ll break down a few of his assertions here.", "Hotze tells his viewers: \u201cIf you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected. The so-called COVID-19 vaccine does not provide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19, nor does it prevent the spread of the disease. It does not meet the CDC\u2019s own definition of a vaccine. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a deceptive trade practice under 15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission for pharmaceutical companies who are producing this experimental gene therapy to claim that it\u2019s a vaccine.\u201d", "The vaccines have demonstrated in\u00a0clinical\u00a0trials\u00a0to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, as we\u2019ve detailed.\u00a0The Pfizer and Moderna trials enrolled more than 30,000 people each and found an efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease of at least 94% after the second dose.\u00a0So his claim that the vaccines don\u2019t \u201cprovide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19\u2033 is wrong.", "As we\u2019ve\u00a0explained before, it\u2019s currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission\u00a0of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. In other words, while the vaccines were shown to prevent someone from developing symptoms of COVID-19, they may not prevent a person from carrying the virus. But there\u2019s a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.", "Hotze\u2019s remark that mRNA vaccines don\u2019t \u201cmeet the CDC\u2019s own definition of a vaccine\u201d also holds no weight.", "He points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website defines\u00a0a vaccine as a \u201cproduct that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.\u201d That\u2019s correct. But that definition is also consistent with the FDA\u2019s decision to issue emergency use authorizations for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines because of their demonstrated efficacy in trials.", "\u201cClearly, Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s vaccines are \u2018product[s] that stimulate a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease,\u2019 i.e., COVID-19, and they have a protective effect,\u201d Jacob Sherkow, a University of Illinois law professor whose research focuses in part on the legal implications of advanced biotechnologies, told us in an email. Sherkow noted that it\u2019s not entirely clear what the legal effects of the CDC\u2019s website definition are, since \u201c[i]t\u2019s not a formal administrative rule or even a guidance \u2026 it\u2019s just a generic definition of a vaccine.\u201d", "Hotze\u2019s argument that the mRNA vaccines are a \u201cdeceptive trade practice\u201d also doesn\u2019t make sense. While he cites \u201c15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission,\u201d it appears he\u2019s referring to 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 45 \u2014 since section 41 just deals with the establishment of the FTC.", "\u201cThe only thing \u00a7 45 of the FTC Act does, here, is give FTC authority to police \u2018deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,'\u201d Sherkow said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t define what a deceptive act\u00a0is.\u201d", "Sherkow said the definition of a \u201cdeceptive practice\u201d rests on many years\u2019 worth of case law: \u201cIn general, those arise when three conditions are met: there is a representation or omission that misleads a consumer; the consumer\u2019s interpretation is \u2018reasonable\u2019; and the misrepresentation is \u2018material,\u2019 i.e., the consumer purchased the product\u00a0because of the representation.\u201d", "\u201cNone of those are present here,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no misrepresentation about the nature of these vaccines \u2014 indeed, there\u2019s an\u00a0ocean of information about exactly what they are and how they work.\u201d", "Again referencing the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, Hotze falsely claims: \u201cThese so-called vaccines, which are manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s, should more accurately be called experimental gene therapy. They are untested, unproven experimental gene therapy that poses a much greater danger and risk to your health than the COVID-19.\u201d", "We\u2019ll first address his false assertion that the vaccines are an \u201cexperimental gene therapy\u201d \u2014 an allegation he makes repeatedly throughout his video.", "The FDA\u2019s website defines gene therapy as a \u201ctechnique that modifies a person\u2019s genes to treat or cure disease.\u201d", "Sherkow, who has written about gene therapy, said the mRNA vaccines don\u2019t qualify as such.", "\u201cThe mRNA vaccines do not modify a person\u2019s genes, i.e., their genome,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re transcripts of the virus\u2019s Spike gene that get translated into protein and expressed in cells; the mRNA degrades afterwards. The genome remains unchanged.\u201d", "Likewise, the co-directors of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development recently explained why the \u201cgene therapy\u201d claims are inaccurate, in a piece addressing vaccine myths for the Washington Post.", "\u201c[T]he mRNA delivered through lipid nanoparticles in a vaccine does not enter our genome. It becomes a template for cells to make compounds of amino acids on molecules called ribosomes in the cytoplasm compartment of the cell, outside the nucleus (where the DNA resides),\u201d Dr. Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi wrote. \u201cOur immune system then responds to the new peptide, which resembles the spike protein on the coronavirus. Therefore, it\u2019s not correct to say that the mRNA vaccines are equivalent to \u2018gene therapy,\u2019 as\u00a0some critics of the vaccines have claimed.\u201d", "And Hotze\u2019s claim that the mRNA vaccines are \u201cmanufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s\u201d is wrong, too.", "As we\u2019ve explained before, fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines \u2014 such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A. But those cells\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0present\u00a0in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.", "The mRNA vaccines from\u00a0Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, however, aren\u2019t made from a virus and are not manufactured using those fetal cell lines, as Hotze claims. That said, one of the cell lines was used to test those two mRNA vaccines to ensure they worked.", "A third vaccine approved in the U.S. \u2014 a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson that does not use the mRNA platform \u2014 is made by using an adenovirus that is produced using a retinal cell line that was first obtained from a fetus in 1985, according to the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Like other vaccines manufactured using the cell lines, fetal cells are not actually present in the J&J COVID-19 vaccine.", "Hotze distorts the facts in attempting to claim that the mRNA vaccines are dangerous.", "He claims that the vaccines will cause your immune system to \u201cbe hyper-charged because it\u2019s having to fight off all these viral proteins that your own body is making all the time, and it will overreact when exposed to any type of coronavirus in the future.\u201d He goes on to say that, in previous studies dealing with coronaviruses, \u201cthe animals died from an immune system hyper reaction, when they were later exposed to the coronavirus against which they had been previously vaccinated.\u201d", "There is no evidence that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines result in such an immune response.", "Hotze\u2019s website post of the video references a commentary article from October, before any COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA, in which two researchers warned about the possibility that COVID-19 vaccine candidates could cause antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, or ADE. ADE\u00a0is a phenomenon that occurs when a previous infection or vaccination generates antibodies that don\u2019t neutralize the virus but instead enhance the virus\u2019 ability to infect cells, which can lead to a worse illness instead of preventing it.", "But the animal studies cited in the commentary piece didn\u2019t deal with mRNA vaccines, as Hotze suggests. One 2012 study that\u2019s referenced found that vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV (the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003) caused mice to develop eosinophilia \u2014 a high count of a type of white blood cells \u2014 when exposed to the live virus. The animals didn\u2019t die, as our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters have explained.", "Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who researches vaccines at the Center for Immunization Research, told us in an email that the issue of ADE in relation to SARS-CoV vaccine candidates dealt with inactivated vaccines \u2014 not mRNA vaccines. She said the specific immune response issue observed with those vaccine candidates has not been observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.S.", "\u201cWe have not seen any cases of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 disease, either in animal models or in vaccinated humans,\u201d she added.", "Other experts also have explained that there is no evidence indicating ADE is an issue with the COVID-19 vaccines.", "Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist, explored the issue in February on his blog on the website of the journal Science Translational Medicine and explained that animal studies are specifically designed to look for signs of ADE. He said the research into SARS-CoV vaccines provided helpful lessons for developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. (A vaccine for SARS\u00a0was never approved, as the outbreak ended and there are no known human cases of the disease.)", "\u201cSo here\u2019s the short version: no sign of ADE during the preclinical animal studies. No sign during the human clinical trials. No sign during the initial vaccine rollouts into the population,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd (so far) no sign of ADE even with the variant strains in different parts of the world. We have things to worry about in this pandemic, but as far as I can tell today, antibody-dependent enhancement does not seem to be one of them.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
