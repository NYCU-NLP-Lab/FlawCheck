["Was South Africa's President Ramaphosa right that more than half of the women in the country had experienced intimate partner violence?", "The sources provided by the presidency for the claim that 51% of South African women experience abuse at the hands of their partners are limited to provinces or smaller regions.", "One of the researchers involved in the 2011 study from which the figure may have been drawn says it can\u2019t be extrapolated to the whole country in 2020.", "The most recent data shows just over a quarter of South African women report domestic abuse, but experts also warn that collecting data on the topic is difficult.", "South Africa experienced a \u201cdark and shameful week\u201d in June 2020, according to president Cyril Ramaphosa.", "In a statement on 13 June, Ramaphosa said that \u201cas much as 51% of South African women have experienced violence at the hands of someone with whom they are in a relationship\u201d.", "His statement followed the murders of Tshegofatso Pule, Naledi Phangindawo, and Nompumelelo Tshaka, which put femicide \u2013 the killing of women \u2013 in the headlines again.", "The latest statistics show South Africa\u2019s femicide rate is 4.8 times higher than the global average. On average, a woman is murdered every three hours in the country.", "But is the president correct about the percentage of South African women who experience violence at the hands of a partner? We investigated.", "The World Health Organization, or WHO, defines \u201cintimate partner violence\u201d as \u201cbehaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm\u201d. It includes physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviour.", "\u201cIf you witness domestic violence as a child in your home you are much more likely to go on to either be the victim of domestic violence in your own relationships later in life or to be a perpetrator of domestic violence,\u201d Gould said.", "A 1999 study showed that between 19.1% and 28.4% of women in the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces reported ever being abused.", "A 2004 study of girls and women attending antenatal clinics in Soweto, a region of Johannesburg, found that 55.5% of participants reported having been physically and/or sexually assaulted by a male partner in their lives.", "A 2006 study of sexually active girls and women aged 15 to 26 in the Eastern Cape found that 26.6% of respondents reported experiencing more than one episode of physical or sexual intimate partner violence.", "The study sent to Africa Check that most closely matches the President\u2019s claim is from 2011. It was conducted by women\u2019s rights organisation Gender Links and the South African Medical Research Council.", "It found that 51.3% of women in Gauteng province reported experiencing either emotional, physical, sexual and/or economic violence in their lifetime.", "Dr Nwabisa Shai is a specialist researcher at the council\u2019s gender and health research unit and worked on the study. She told Africa Check that the study\u2019s findings could not be applied outside of Gauteng.", "\u201cThe danger with generalising to the rest of South Africa is that the rest of South Africa is not like Gauteng,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might find there is a variation between what you might see in the Western Cape, for example.\u201d", "The most recent data on the topic comes from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey. It\u2019s a nationally representative household survey, which provides data on a wide range of topics, such as population, health and nutrition.", "The survey looked at physical, sexual and emotional violence. It found that 26% of women who had ever had a partner had experienced one or more of these forms of violence. Physical violence was the most common form of violence experienced by women, at 21%. This was followed by emotional violence (17%) and sexual violence (6%).", "Rates varied between provinces. In KwaZulu-Natal, 19% of women respondents reported experiencing one or more form of violence. In the Eastern Cape, 38% of women reported experiencing violence.", "Experts said it was not easy to conduct research on intimate partner violence, as it could be a difficult issue to discuss with women.", "\u201cYou have to be very careful when you\u2019re doing research on a subject like this because you don\u2019t want to put the person who you\u2019re interviewing at risk,\u201d said Gould. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the kind of research you can do every day or even every year.\u201d", "There was also limited research on interpersonal violence that included economic abuse. Shai explained that this is when \u201cmen deprive women of access to income and use finances to control women\u201d.", "President Cyril Ramaphosa claimed that \u201cas much as 51% of South African women have experienced violence at the hands of someone with whom they are in a relationship\u201d.", "The presidency provided Africa Check with a number of studies to support his claim, all of which were not nationally representative.", "The most recent, nationally representative data is from 2016. It shows that 26% of women reported physical, sexual or emotional abuse by their partners in their lifetime. We, therefore, rate the president\u2019s claim incorrect.", "It\u2019s important to note that intimate partner violence statistics can be difficult to compile. There is also limited data available on economic abuse.
