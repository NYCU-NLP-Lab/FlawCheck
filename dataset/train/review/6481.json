The pandemic largely erupted in the United States in New York, before doctors had the equipment and therapeutics needed to fight the disease. Florida benefited from the lessons New York learned.", "The numbers in this particularly viral image need context and some lack accuracy.", "Who would have thought a global pandemic would only heighten a longstanding rivalry between Florida and New York?", "Tensions flared early in the COVID-19 outbreak when Florida issued restrictions on travelers from New York, then a raging hot spot for the virus. New York returned the favor in the summer, putting Florida travelers on its own quarantine list.", "Now, social media users are comparing the two states\u2019 handling of the virus, sharing a pro-Florida Instagram post from an account called \"Unwoke Narrative\" that points to the states\u2019 politically opposed governors as reasons for differences in state COVID-19 data.", "Invoking the names of Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and New York\u2019s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a graphic titled \"Cuomo vs. DeSantis: How NY & FL Handled the Virus\" lists several COVID-19 figures for each state. \"Cuomo maintained strict lockdowns, crushing jobs and freedom,\" it says. \"DeSantis took the opposite route and rejected tyranny.

During that early stage, the state was averaging over 900 deaths a day.", "Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health at the University of South Florida, said not only was New York\u2019s experience unlike any other in the nation, but it also informed how the rest of the country would manage the pandemic. \"There\u2019s no question that Florida hospitals were able to learn from what New York went through and benefited as a result,\" she said.", "Cuomo\u2019s administration has faced intense scrutiny over its undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. New York\u2019s attorney general released a Jan. 28 report that found the state had failed to report thousands of deaths.

The latest state numbers from Feb. 4, which includes the hospitalization data, show about 13,300 have died in New York. Florida\u2019s total is around 9,700.", "Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst at Kaiser Family Foundation who has tracked the pandemic\u2019s impact on long-term care facility residents, said the post is problematic because states collect and report data differently.", "\"They're not necessarily comparable,\" she said. \"Non-nursing home settings are defined differently in each state. The best way to compare is to look at recent trends in federal data.\"", "As of Feb. 7, such federal data showed New York had 10.1 positive COVID-19 cases per 1,000 nursing home residents, while Florida was at 6.3. When it came to deaths per 1,000 residents, New York was at 2.99 residents and Florida at 1.85.", "It\u2019s important to note that the states don\u2019t have comparable nursing home population numbers, at least as of 2019. New York was reporting about 19,000 more residents in certified nursing facilities than Florida, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data.", "The post is right that New York has had more deaths than Florida, even when accounting for population.", "The numbers it says it relies on are not far from what we saw recorded on Feb. 25, when New York was reporting about 247 deaths per 100,000 people compared with Florida\u2019s 143.", "But the metric again ignores New York\u2019s unprecedented early peak and the ebb and flow of death rates across states over time. Daily deaths have surged in Florida at times when they remained low in New York, and vice versa.", "\"There\u2019s a time factor here,\" Levine said. \"These pandemics are really epidemics that happen in different places at different times, and you have to really consider that when you\u2019re doing comparisons.\"", "On April 14, for example, when the first wave peaked in New York, the state had a seven-day average of 39.3 deaths per 1 million residents while Florida was at 2.1, according to the COVID Tracking Project. On Aug. 16, Florida recorded a seven-day average 8.5 deaths per million people while New York was at 0.2.", "\"The implication is that the political decisions in Florida versus New York has led to those numbers, but I think that would be a very shallow interpretation of the data,\" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, an assistant professor in health policy and management at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"Lockdown measures do work.\"", "PolitiFact previously found that some of the more strictly regulated states performed better than Florida, as of early December 2020. And a study that Tsai participated in that has been preliminarily accepted for publication found that first-wave lockdowns did result in a downtick in COVID-19 cases two weeks later.", "Daily case numbers provide a snapshot of how one state compares with another on any given day. And the post\u2019s figures showing Florida had 7,400 daily cases as of Feb. 8 while New York was at 9,000 is in the ballpark with what we see in COVID Tracker data for that period.", "But the metric does not reflect additional data points that place New York in a better position than Florida: the number of people tested and each state\u2019s rolling positivity average. It again ignores that there were times when daily cases were high in Florida when they were not in New York.", "On Feb. 8, New York reported a 5.1% positivity rate, according to state data and Florida saw a 7% positivity rate.
