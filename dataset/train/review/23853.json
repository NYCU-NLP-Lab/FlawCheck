Marco Rubio told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.", "Rubio said on the Sept. 20, 2015, episode of This Week that political newcomers like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson were seeing success because people were tired of establishment candidates. But the CNN debate earlier in the week in Simi Valley, Calif., also showed that coverage isn\u2019t focused on the country\u2019s problems, he said.", "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s limited to the politicians, it\u2019s also the media,\" Rubio said. \"We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy. It was a constant he-said-she-said, what do you say because so-and-so called you this name or that name.\"", "What did the candidates really discuss during the debate? We reviewed the transcript and wouldn\u2019t say there was \"no discussion\" about the debt, but Rubio has a point there was little said about the economy.", "The economy", "We\u2019ll actually start with how much the candidates said about the economy, because it came up first, much in the way Rubio described. (We reached out to his campaign for more on this\u00a0but didn\u2019t hear back.)", "After lengthy discussions about Trump\u2019s worthiness as a candidate, Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria, Congress attempting to defund Planned Parenthood,\u00a0immigration and other issues, moderator Jake Tapper switched gears.", "\"We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs,\" he acknowledged, but used the pivot to asked Fiorina to respond to Trump\u2019s criticism of her record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. Fiorina then recounted her history with the company, before mentioning voter concerns over the nation\u2019s $18 trillion debt as an attack on Trump.", "\"There are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money,\" Fiorina said to Trump. \"That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times, a record four times.\"", "Tapper later asked questions about the minimum wage and tax policy, which one could argue are related to the economy. But he asked no direct questions about job creation or debt.", "Still, candidates did mention the economy as they addressed other questions.", "Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that when he left Congress, \"we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming.\" He implied his time as a congressman from 1982 to 2001 will help him find consensus as president to \"create a stronger economy for everybody.\"", "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pointed out Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton\u2019s call for a higher minimum wage is \"her answer to grow the economy.\" Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee mentioned that finding cures to cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s will save the country trillions, and would \"change the economy and the country.\"", "Rubio, meanwhile, discussed the economy when answering a question about climate change. He said disregarding alarms raised by \"the left-wing government\" was necessary because \"every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America.\"", "\"We are not going to destroy our economy,\" he said. \"We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely.\"", "New Jersey\u00a0Gov.
