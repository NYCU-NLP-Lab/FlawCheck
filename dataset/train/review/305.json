For instance, anything that vibrates 330 times in one second will produce an E note\u2014a guitar string, a tuning fork or even a tire. To produce an E note with a car, we had to space the rumble strips such that if driven at 45 mph for one second, the car would hit 330 strips. A bit of math tells us this is 2.4 inches between each rumble strip. After that, it\u2019s a case of breaking down the music into exact chunks of time and applying the same technique to each space depending on what note is needed and for how long.\u201d", "This isn't the only musical highway in the world.
