["By Robert Farley", "Posted on August 28, 2018", "In announcing a tentative agreement with Mexico, President Donald Trump called Mexico \u201ca very large trading partner\u201d and\u00a0said negotiations would now begin with Canada, which he called a \u201csmaller segment.\u201d\u00a0But U.S. trade with Canada was about $57 billion larger than trade with Mexico in 2017.", "Trump\u2019s comment came during a phone call with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico to announce what Trump called the \u201cUnited States-Mexico Trade Agreement.\u201d Trump said the new pact would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which also includes Canada. (We should note that it is far from a done deal. An agreement would still have to be approved by the U.S. Congress, as well as by Mexican lawmakers.)", "Left unresolved was whether Canada would be a part of the new deal, though Trump said negotiations with the U.S. northern neighbor would begin \u201cpretty much immediately.\u201d\u00a0(Indeed, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland arrived in Washington the following day for talks.)", "Although Pe\u00f1a Nieto made clear in the call that he wants Canada to be incorporated into the deal, Trump said that when it comes to Canada, \u201cWe can have a separate deal or we can put it into this deal.\u201d Alternatively, Trump said that the U.S. might impose tariffs on U.S. imports of cars from Canada.", "\u201cBut one way or the other, we have a deal with Canada,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt will either be a tariff on cars, or it will be a negotiated deal.\u201d", "Trump, Aug. 27: We made the deal with Mexico. And I think it\u2019s a very \u2014 deal. We\u2019re starting negotiations with Canada, pretty much immediately. I can\u2019t tell you where those negotiations are going. It\u2019s going to be a \u2014 it\u2019s a smaller segment, as you know. Mexico is a very large trading partner. But we\u2019ve now concluded our deal and it\u2019s being finalized.", "We reached out to the White House and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for clarification of the president\u2019s remark about the Canadian deal being a \u201csmaller segment.\u201d We did not get a response. In context, the president appears to be saying that Mexico is a larger trading partner with the U.S. than Canada. And that\u2019s not the case.", "According to the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau, Canada and Mexico are the second and third largest trading partners for the U.S., in that order.", "In 2017, the U.S. did nearly $680 billion worth of trade in goods and services with Canada, the Census Bureau reports \u2014 $341.3 billion in exports and $338.5 in imports. That was about $57.7 billion more in trade with Canada than with Mexico. The U.S. did $622.1 billion worth of trade with Mexico \u2014 $276.7 billion in exports and $345.4 billion in imports.", "China was tops in combined trade with the U.S. at $711.7 billion.", "Figures from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show similar results. According to its estimates, U.S. goods and services trade with Canada totaled $673.1 billion in 2017. That\u2019s $57.2 billion more than the $615.9 billion in total U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico last year. (The Census and USTR trade numbers differ slightly because the Census numbers are on a \u201cbalance of payments basis,\u201d an adjustment made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, as we\u2019ve explained before.)", "We will update this item if we hear back from the White House.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
