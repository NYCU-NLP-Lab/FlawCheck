However, the Facebook page associated with the website is run by one person in Canada, and one in Italy.", "Only in a separate \u201cDisclaimer\u201d page does the website divulge its allegedly satirical purpose, although the tone and genre of its content makes this ambiguous to readers.", "The website that made the article become viral, conservativemovement.ca, was created in late-July 2020 by Ontario-based artist Ray Liyaga, according to a domain name search.", "Contacted by AFP, Liyaga did not wish to comment.", "The website mainly provides news praising the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) or that is damaging\u00a0to Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party.
