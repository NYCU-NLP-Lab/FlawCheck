Yovanovitch, Carlson then said, wasn't truthful in her Oct. 11 closed-door testimony about the handling of that email. Carlson said his show had obtained the email from the staffer to Yovanovitch.", "\"Yovanovitch claimed that she never personally responded to it. Never responded to the Democratic staffer. In fact, it turns out that she did respond. In fact, she said, \u2018look forward to chatting with you\u2019 to that staffer,\" Carlson said. \"And as Congressman (Lee) Zeldin pointed out, the ambassador\u2019s original answer, which was dishonest, was given under oath.\"", "It appears Ambassador Yovanovitch did not accurately answer this question I asked her during her \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d deposition under oath. https://t.co/2Ju420Pkpb pic.twitter.com/WACsyksMzW", "The scope of this fact-check is to assess Carlson\u2019s key claim: That Yovanovitch gave dishonest testimony under oath.
