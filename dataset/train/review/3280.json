The Senate Democrats\u2019 collective Twitter account documented the event.", "The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump.", "The Spanish-language text says: \"El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este a\u00f1o. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias @realDonaldTrump.\"", "In English, that translates as: \"The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Analysts say the president is to blame. Thanks, Trump.\" (Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweet\u2019s uploaded video clip, didn\u2019t use those exact words and didn\u2019t cite a percentage increase.)", "So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they haven\u2019t risen by that much.", "We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse.", "We found that retail gasoline prices were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018.

On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. That\u2019s an increase of 19.7 percent.", "Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., told thestreet.com in late April that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said.", "\"All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies,\" Fielden told the website. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices \"is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black.\"", "After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweet\u2019s caption stuck closely to Menendez\u2019 wording in the video, saying, \"El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la pol\u00edtica del presidente.\" (That translates as, \"The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising.
