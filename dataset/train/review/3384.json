It\u2019s just that we can\u2019t find any evidence that Sandler actually said any of it.", "The post said Sandler was on an unnamed podcast when the atheist host began to disparage religion in general and Mormons in particular. Sandler, who grew up in a Jewish family, spoke up to defend the faith.", "\"I don\u2019t know, Tom. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you\u2019re just having some fun here but \u2014 from my experience \u2014 Mormons are some of the most decent people I\u2019ve ever come across,\" the story attributed to Sandler.", "He said more in the post, but they aren\u2019t real quotes. Apart from there being a parody out there of his Hanukkah Song adapted for Mormons, we really couldn\u2019t find him making much of any comment about Mormons at all.", "But that\u2019s because WRPM33.com and scads of other sites are posting a made-up story. \"Most of the articles on wrpm33.com are works of fantasy or satire and are not true,\" the site\u2019s disclaimer said. The sites use domain names that sound like official media outlets, but don\u2019t contain any apparent contact information.", "These are the same kinds of websites responsible for other stories we\u2019ve looked at that claim celebrities have said or done things they haven\u2019t. One popular story said that a celebrity made nice comments about the residents of a town after car trouble. Another post claimed that a celebrity enjoyed a town so much, they are moving there.", "In both cases, the name of the town and celebrity can change, with the bulk of the story staying the same. There\u2019s even another subset of links telling readers that a Star Wars movie will be filming near their city.", "The object is clearly to get residents of the town named to click on the link, to earn advertising revenue for the (unidentified) owners of the site.", "We\u2019ve already seen another version of this story that attributed the same quotes to Matthew McConaughey. More are sure to come.", "Be aware that links you see about celebrity news may be fabricated, especially if they mention a smaller location.", "It\u2019s a friendly sentiment, but Sandler didn\u2019t say these things.
