["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on April 10, 2019", "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrongly stated that Syrian President \u201cBashar al-Assad\u00a0controls a small fraction of Syria.\u201d Middle East experts tell us that Assad controls a majority of Syria\u2019s land and population.", "Pompeo made his remarks during an April 8 interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. Pompeo urged the Cuban government to stop supporting\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s\u00a0Maduro \u2014 telling Baier that Maduro\u2019s \u201cdays are numbered\u201d \u2014 when in an aside the secretary also remarked about Assad\u2019s power in Syria.", "Pompeo, April 8: I might add, Bashar al-Assad controls a small fraction of Syria today. The work that the Trump administration has done to deny Assad the capacity to rebuild his nation \u2014 this is the guy who believes he won, but the truth is the Middle East is in a much more stable, much better place today than it was when President Obama was running the joint in Syria.", "\u201cPompeo\u2019s comment is false,\u201d Steven Heydemann, director of Middle East Studies at Smith College, told us in an email. \u201cThe Assad regime controls about 60% of Syrian territory, including the entire western \u2018spine\u2019 of the country that includes all its major cities and a large majority of its population.\u201d", "The civil war in Syria started in March 2011, and, at its weakest point in 2015, Assad\u2019s government held less than a fifth of Syria. \u201cHowever, the Asad government \u2014 backed by Russia and Iran \u2014 has reasserted control over much of western Syria since 2015, and appears poised to claim victory in the conflict,\u201d according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "CRS, March 25:\u00a0The collapse of IS [Islamic State] and opposition territorial control in most of Syria since 2015 has been matched by significant military and territorial gains by the Syrian government. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment stated in February 2018 that, \u201cThe conflict has decisively shifted in the Syrian regime\u2019s favor, enabling Russia and Iran to further entrench themselves inside the country.\u201d", "A Jan. 14 Bloomberg News article\u00a0on the various forces still fighting in Syria includes a map that shows the Assad regime controls about two-thirds of Syria \u2014\u00a0nearly all of the land southwest of the Euphrates River, which serves as a natural barrier between the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, and the Russia-backed Syrian military.", "\u201cThe Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria, comprising about a quarter of the country, are the largest remaining areas outside of Syrian government control,\u201d the CRS report said. \u201cAsad has stated that his government intends to recover these areas, whether by negotiations or military force.\u201d", "Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, agreed that Pompeo\u2019s statement was \u201cnot correct.\u201d In an email, he told us that\u00a0\u201cin terms of population, Assad controls a substantially higher percentage of the densely populated regions of the country.\u201d", "\u201cThe main cities under government control are: Damascus,\u00a0Homs, Hama,\u00a0Aleppo, Latakia, Tartus,\u00a0Palmyra, Albu Kamal,\u201d according to a March 13 Al-Jazeera article headlined \u201cSyria\u2019s War: Who Control What?\u201d Aleppo\u00a0is the largest city in Syria, followed by Damascus and Homs, according to the World Atlas.", "\u201cThe regime is not in control of two important areas: parts of northwest Syria from north of Homs up to the border with Turkey. This area includes the city and province of Idlib and areas under Turkish control,\u201d Heydemann said.\u00a0\u201cIn addition, the regime is not in control of a large part of Syria\u2019s northeast, which is dominated by Kurdish forces that are supported by the U.S.\u201d", "Idlib province has been under rebel control since 2015. It is the \u201cthe most significant zone remaining outside of government control in western Syria\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe final opposition stronghold,\u201d according to CRS. Idlib is strategically important to the Assad regime because it allows direct transit from government-control areas in the south to Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, according to CRS.", "The area in the northeast that is under control of Kurdish forces is strategically important because that\u2019s where \u201cmost of Syria\u2019s major oil production facilities\u201d are located, Heydemann said. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cthe PYD \u2013 the most powerful Kurdish political party in the northeast \u2013 has entered into agreements to provide the Assad regime with oil from the areas it controls.\u201d", "The Wall Street Journal, in a Feb. 8 article, said the decision by the Kurdish forces to sell oil to the Assad regime \u201crepresent[s] a new challenge to U.S. efforts to starve the Syrian government of oil.\u201d", "Clearly, Assad doesn\u2019t have full control of Syria as he did before the civil war. But he controls more than \u201ca small fraction\u201d of it, contrary to what Pompeo said.", "We asked the State Department to clarify Pompeo\u2019s remarks, but did not receive a response. We will update this article if we do.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
