The report stated that a migrant labourer kicked the food and mistreated the woman who had prepared it at quarantine centre set up in a school in Madhwapur block of Bihar\u2019s Madhubani district. However, the report did not talk about the woman hailing from the Dalit community. It said that the staff members had asked migrant labourers to follow social distancing while having their food. This angered a few causing them to misbehave.", "The video attached in the report is the same video viral on social media with the claim that two Muslim men kicked the food cooked by Dalit women. The video is from Bihar and is related to the incident from Madhwapur block.

He said that there is no Dalit-Muslim angle to the incident. The people who were quarantined were asked to follow social distancing norms. Hence, the food was cooked and kept at a place from where they were supposed self-serve but some of them requested that they are (normally) served the food while they sit to eat. When they were denied the same, they got furious and started hurling abuses. An FIR has been lodged against three people namely, Pankaj Kumar Rai, Manoj Rai and Ashok Shah.", "The viral claim, however, names two Muslim men \u2013 Shiraj Ahmed and Bhujouli Kurd \u2013 who threw food cooked by a Dalit woman. This is a separate incident which has been falsely associated with the one that took place in Bihar. But the incident didn\u2019t involve two Muslim men but one Siraj Ahmad who is a resident of Bhujouli Khurd village in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kushinagar district. Thus, Bhujoli Khurd is not the name of a person as claimed on social media but a village. In several parts of India, an area of a village is broadly divided into two halves. The bigger one is called \u2018Kalan\u2019 whereas the smaller one is called \u2018Khurd\u2019.", "\u201cA 35-year-old has been booked by the police for refusing to eat food at a quarantine centre on the ground that it was cooked by a Dalit.\u201d reported Outlook on April 14, 2020. \u201cThe village head Lilawati Devi, who hails from the Dalit community, had prepared food at the quarantine centre in the absence of the [designated] cook but Siraj refused to eat it. A case has been registered against Siraj under the SC/ST Act and he has been arrested by the police,\u201d the report adds.", "Therefore, several social media users shared the video of an incident from Bihar as that of an incident from Uttar Pradesh. These are two separate incidents. The incident from Bihar has no Dalit angle.
