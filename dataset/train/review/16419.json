I have a 90% \u2014 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That\u2019s an all-time record. Can you believe that? Isn\u2019t that something?

We emailed the White House to point us to the poll Trump relied on. We did not hear back.", "Looking at support among Republican voters, Trump\u2019s highest number in the latest polls is 87% from Gallup. CNN comes in second at 86%. The other four are lower.", "All polls are based on surveys done at the end of May. No margin of error, among the polls that provide them, would be large enough to deliver the 94% that Trump claimed.", "Trump\u2019s approval among Republicans has generally held in the mid-to-high 80s, which would qualify as robust. Gallup clocked in a slightly higher number of 90% in March and April.

Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office. Here\u2019s the full picture, going back to Dwight Eisenhower.", "Trump once claimed that he had the highest polling numbers \"in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.\" We rated that False. Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln\u2019s time. That is pure invention.", "For real record-setting, look to George W.
