Facebook users flagged it as potentially false, and it is.", "The story originated on a website called ReaganWasRight.com, which describes its content as \u201cconservative satire.\u201d But the story was recently copied and posted by more than a dozen other websites that don\u2019t have a disclaimer, some of which have names that sound like legitimate news outlets.", "One website calls itself The Hill Live, a name similar to the Washington, D.C. newspaper The Hill, and another calls itself The Politico News, a name similar to the political news website Politico. The two phony sites have no connection to the legitimate ones.

The company with the largest share is Omaha, Nebraska-based Election Systems & Software, which was led for more than a decade by Aldo Tesi.", "Tesi has donated to a political action committee, called Commercial Federal, that supported largely, but not exclusively, Republican candidates for House and Senate races in Nebraska. He also gave $500 to Democrat Ben Nelson\u2019s first campaign for U.S. Senate in 1996. Nelson, who had been the state\u2019s governor throughout most of the 1990s, made it to the Senate in 2001 and became one of that body\u2019s most conservative Democrats, according to GovTrack.us.", "This isn\u2019t the first time that a false story has gotten popular by claiming that millions of Democratic votes were fraudulent.", "In August, we wrote about a claim that 25 million votes for Hillary Clinton were fraudulent.
