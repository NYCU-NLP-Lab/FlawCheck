["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on January 9, 2019", "The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates nine times since 2015, so a claim circulating on social media that there were no increases during the Obama administration is wrong.", "The central bank raised interest rates on Dec. 19, 2018 for the ninth time since 2015.", "Two of those increases were during the last two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which inherited a weak economy following the Great Recession that began in 2007. The other seven increases came after President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.", "So, this claim circulating on social media is wrong: \u201cFederal Reserve raises interest rates THE FOURTH TIME since Trump was elected. It raised them zero times under Obama. The goal? Slow down Trump\u2019s economic boom. Economic slowdown will affect the 2020 election. Another Deep State move.\u201d", "The claim started out on Twitter, where it was retweeted more than 4,000 times, then it migrated to Facebook, where it\u2019s been shared more than 2,500 times.", "The Federal Reserve lists the increases on its website. There are also press releases for each of\u00a0nine\u00a0as well.", "Also, Jerome Powell, whom Trump nominated to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, has voted for each of them \u2014 first as a board member and then after he became the chairman in early 2018. So, Trump chose Powell to lead the central bank after he had voted for five interest rate increases.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cFederal Reserve issues FOMC statement.\u201d Press release.
