However, this article, which was originally published by \"NewsPunch,\" an outlet notorious for misleading reporting, gets a number of facts wrong.", "For one, these fires were not set in \"protest\" of Trump. A contemporary report from the Star Tribune reported that 19-year-old Tnuza Jamal Hassan set several fires at her former school \"in retaliation for U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"", "The report continued: \"Tnuza J. Hassan, of Minneapolis, allegedly told police that \u201cshe wanted the school to burn to the ground and that her intent was to hurt people,\u201d according to the complaint charging her with one count of felony first-degree arson filed in Ramsey County District Court. According to the charge, Hassan said similar attacks happened on \u201cMuslim land\u201d and no one cared if Muslims were hurt. She told police and fire investigators, \u201cYou guys are lucky that I don\u2019t know how to build a bomb because I would have done that.\u201d", "Neither the words \"protest\" nor \"Trump\" appeared in any of the contemporary articles from credible news outlets that we examined.", "NewsPunch also used a misleading (and completely unrelated) image of a fire to exaggerate the blaze's impact. The photograph featured above does not show St. Catherine\u2019s University. This image actually shows an abandoned church that burned down in 2006 in Quebec. We have not been able to locate photographs from the actual fires set by Hassan, but CBS reported that the \"fires were small and quickly contained,\" that \"nobody was injured,\" and that the \"damage was limited to furnishings.\"", "In addition to NewsPunch's misleading reporting, many people on social media made incorrect assumptions about this story after encountering it in March 2019. For instance, several readers were upset that Hassan only faced arson charges, rather than terrorism charges. In the months since Hassan's arrest in January 2018, however, she was indicted on terrorism charges:", "A Minnesota woman whom prosecutors said set fires at a Minnesota university out of anger because of U.S. military actions overseas was charged with terrorism Wednesday after she allegedly tried to assist a terrorist organization last year.", "Tnuza Jamal Hassan, 19, was charged in federal court for attempting to provide material support to Al Qaeda, lying to the FBI and arson, Fox 9 reported.
