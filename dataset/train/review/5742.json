Jackie Speier, D-Calif., was one of many voices who noticed the administration\u2019s hardened view toward WikiLeaks.", "CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer interviewed Speier, a member of the House intelligence committee, on April 13 about Pompeo\u2019s characterization of WikiLeaks.", "How much did Trump the candidate love WikiLeaks in the last days of the campaign? She attempted to count the ways.", "\"If you recall during the election cycle, in the last month of the campaign, I believe that President Trump as a candidate hailed WikiLeaks as the new savior, had mentioned it over 160 times in speeches during that period of time.", "Really, that many times? We decided to check it out.", "WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2016\u00a0and released thousands of emails\u00a0from Democratic National Committee staffers in July 2016.", "Speier\u2019s office said she was referring to a Jan. 7 article by left-leaning website ThinkProgress for her statement.

Speier\u2019s figure of over 160 seems possible, however, because he often referenced disclosures from WikiLeaks without using the group\u2019s name, and it\u2019s possible there were interviews or speeches where Trump brought up WikiLeaks that our search didn\u2019t return.", "At the time, Wikileaks steadily released a series of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman.", "These emails were characterized by Trump and her other critics as showing Clinton held policy positions in private that were different from her public positions, that she\u00a0received town hall topics in advance, and that they demonstrated negative internal dynamics inside the Clinton campaign.", "Trump repeatedly brought up the emails, encouraged his supporters to see them for themselves, and also described several revelations inaccurately.", "Let\u2019s replay some of the biggest hits.", "\"The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we have ever seen as a country before,\" \u00a0Trump said at a rally in Colorado on Oct. 29.", "\"Hillary Clinton, as WikiLeaks proves, is a corrupt globalist,\" he said at a rally on Oct 21.", "\"I love WikiLeaks,\" he said on Oct. 10.", "Trump has not said much publicly about WikiLeaks as president.
