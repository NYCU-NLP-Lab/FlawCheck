Nathan Deal recently told one group.", "Deal said the changes in criminal sentencing adopted in 2012 have helped Georgia\u2019s bottom line by about $20 million. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw an article that outlined the claim and asked us to check it out. We wanted to know whether the governor\u2019s numbers were on target. Or should he be sentenced for faulty math?", "The governor made the comments at a reception of graduates of the University of Georgia School of Public Affairs in Atlanta. Deal told the group he was surprised by the speed and size of the savings, Morris News Service reported.", "\"I was amazed at the dollar figures ... and amazed at the time frame,\" said Deal, a Republican.", "Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said that in 2011 the state paid counties more than $23 million to house state inmates in county jails, some of which were overcrowded.", "\"In 2013, the payments were slightly under $3.2 million \u2014 approximately $20 million less!\" Robinson wrote in one email.", "In 2012, Deal, a former prosecutor, said Georgia needed more cost-effective criminal justice approaches that didn't compromise public safety.

In Deal\u2019s proposed budget, Georgia\u2019s Department of Corrections projected it would pay about $4.6 million to counties. Deal recommended about $1.6 million.", "Georgia\u2019s Department of Corrections sent us several spreadsheets that also backed up the governor\u2019s claim. In 2011, Deal\u2019s first year in office, Georgia spent about $26.5 million to house state inmates in county jails. In 2013, the state paid counties nearly $3.8 million. That\u2019s a $22.7 million difference.", "Statistics show there are fewer Georgia prisoners in state and county lockups.", "In March 2011, the average daily population in county jails awaiting a trip to state prison was nearly 5,000, Corrections Department figures show.
