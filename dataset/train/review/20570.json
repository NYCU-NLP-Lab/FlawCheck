["In his speech to rally support for Tennessee Republicans, President Donald Trump spoke briefly about progress in the fight against the opioid crisis. He remarked on the new money approved in the latest congressional spending bill.", "\"We got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of the scourge that\u2019s taking over our country,\" Trump said May 29. \"And the numbers are way down.\"", "\"We\u2019re getting the word out \u2014 bad. Bad stuff. You go to the hospital, you have a broken arm, you come out, you\u2019re a drug addict with this crap. It\u2019s way down. We\u2019re doing a good job with it. But we got $6 billion to help us with opioid.\"", "We wondered what opioid numbers he was talking about, and whether they are really \"way down.\"", "The White House cited an article about the decline in the number of opioid prescriptions. But the reduction in prescriptions might mean less than it seems, and opioid deaths remain high.", "Reporting on a study from a health data firm, an April 19 Washington Post article said the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies (measured in morphine equivalents) dropped 10 percent in 2017. The study by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science suggested that public outrage over over-prescribing had led to restraint by physicians.", "But a drop in opioid prescriptions isn\u2019t a guaranteed sign of progress.

For the synthetic opioids alone, such as fentanyl, deaths were up 57 percent.", "Deaths from prescription painkillers such as oxycodone (the natural/semi-synthetic category) rose by a small fraction.", "The only possible bright spot in the numbers is that while the death toll continues to rise, it rose at a slower rate than the year before.", "The timing of the funding increase Trump mentioned also undercuts his claim.", "The appropriations bill that provided $6 billion to federal, state and local agencies to turn back the opioid crisis became law at the end of March.", "It is dubious to argue that this money flowed quickly enough to have a measurable impact on the opioid problem, especially since the total amount would come over two years.", "Trump said that in the opioid crisis, \"the numbers are way down.\" One study shows a 10 percent decline in the the number of opioid prescriptions at retail pharmacies.", "However, the latest government figures show a 15 percent increase in opioid overdose deaths between 2016 and 2017.
