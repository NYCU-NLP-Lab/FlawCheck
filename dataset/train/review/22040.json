The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact legislation for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.", "While the story ran the proposal verbatim, it did not identify any specific language in the bill authorizing officials to remove children from their households.

It was enacted on 30 June 2015, meaning that students would be required to be vaccinated unless they were granted a medical exemption.", "Pan reported getting threats via email and by phone after the bill was signed, enough so that he required additional security.
