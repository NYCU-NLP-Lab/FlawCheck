Ilhan Omar \u2014 put their hands on the Quran in their photos.", "Now a made-up story is circulating online claiming: \u201cSupreme Court Rules 5-4: Oaths Not Taken on Bibles Illegal.\u201d That\u2019s false.", "First of all, the story originated on a website that has a disclaimer warning readers: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d Parts of the made-up story, though, were copied by other sites without a disclaimer and presented as news.", "Besides that, there is misinformation in the story that should be corrected. For example, the story claims that the U.S. Constitution requires elected officials to be sworn in using the Bible. The Constitution says no such thing. Article VI requires that senators and representatives take an \u201coath or affirmation, to support this Constitution,\u201d but it says nothing about using the Bible. In fact, the next part of that clause says, \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d", "Also, to be clear, there is no requirement that members hold anything or put their left hand on anything when they raise their right hand to take the oath of office, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service that describes the process in detail.", "And, of course, a quick check of recent Supreme Court decisions shows that the justices haven\u2019t issued any rulings on the subject of oaths of office.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "C-SPAN (@cspan). \u201c.@SpeakerPelosi administers the oath of office for members of the House of Representatives for the #116thCongress. https://cs.pn/2ArT47K.\u201d Twitter. 3 Jan 2019.", "Pew Research Center. \u201cFaith on the Hill: The religious composition of the 116th Congress.\u201d 3 Jan 2019.", "\u201cBREAKING: Supreme Court Rules 5-4: Oaths Not Taken on Bibles Illegal.\u201d WeAreThellod.com. 6 Jan 2019.", "U.S. Constitution.
