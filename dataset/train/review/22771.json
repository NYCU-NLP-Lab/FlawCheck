["\u2022 Former White House advisor Steven Bannon says Anthony Fauci, director of the Centers for Control and Prevention, said Americans shouldn't \"worry\" about COVID-19.", "\u2022 In late January, Fauci twice said the country shouldn't fret.", "\u2022 But both times, he added that the situation could change.", "Former White House advisor Steve Bannon has been defending President Donald Trump against criticism that he was slow\u00a0 responding to the coronavirus.", "Bannon recently lauded Trump's Jan. 31 order restricting travel with China, the original source of the virus. Bannon said the action came while a key medical adviser - Anthony Fauci,\u00a0 director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases - was saying COVID-19 was not a threat to the United States.", "\"Fauci told us there\u2019s nothing to worry about. That\u2019s his quote, \u2018There\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u2019\" Bannon said during an April 14 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show, a conservative broadcast based in Portsmouth, Va.", "We fact-checked Bannon\u2019s claim. Bannon, a Richmond, Va. native, cited two instances in late January when Fauci said the disease wasn\u2019t a big threat\u00a0to Americans. Each time, however, Fauci added that the situation could change.", "On Jan. 21 - the day\u00a0the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. was confirmed -\u00a0Fauci appeared on conservative Newsmax TV. \"Bottom line, we don\u2019t have to worry about this one, right?\" asked Greg Kelly, the host.", "Fauci said, \"Obviously, you need to take it seriously and do the kind of things the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the Department of Homeland Security is doing. But this is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.\"", "So Fauci, in a qualified response said, don't worry \"right now;\" \"you need to take it seriously;\" and although \"this is not a major threat,\"\u00a0 keep an ear open to the CDC and Homeland Security.", "On Jan. 26, Fauci gave an interview to John Catsimatidis, a syndicated radio host in New York. \"What can you tell the American people about what\u2019s been going on?\" Catsimatidis asked. \"Should they be scared?\"", "\"I don\u2019t think so,\" Fauci said. \"The American people should not be worried or frightened by this. It\u2019s a very, very low risk to the United States, but it\u2019s something we, as public health officials, need to take very seriously.\"", "Fauci reiterated that the COVID-19 \"isn\u2019t something the American people need to worry about or be frightened about\" because, at the time, it was centered in China and the U.S. could screen travelers from that nation.", "But Fauci also twice described the virus as \"an evolving situation,\" and said, \"Every day, we have to look at it very carefully.\"", "On April 13, PolitiFact National examined a tweet by Republican DeAnna Lorraine, a unsuccessful California congressional candidate. She said Fauci \"was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and (COVID-19) posed no threat to the US public at large.\"", "Lorraine\u2019s statement was ruled Mostly False. Although Fauci said that day he saw no immediate need for social distancing, PolitiFact noted that his comments were \"filled with caveats that the situation could change.\" And contrary to Lorraine\u2019s tweet, Fauci\u2019s didn\u2019t say then \"there was nothing to worry about.\"", "Bannon\u2019s remark is based on different Fauci statements from an earlier time with different words and different context.", "Bannon said, \"Fauci told us there\u2019s nothing to worry about.
