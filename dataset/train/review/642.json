It also seeks to mandate that no federal funds be used to create or display monuments, symbols, or statues that commemorate such presidents.", "The bill does not explicitly mention former President Donald Trump, though he is the first (and currently the only) president in U.S. history to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives.", "In late January 2021, a number of Democrats brought forward the \u201cNo Glory for Hate Act\u201d in the U.S. House of Representatives, a bill that seeks to impose restrictions on certain former presidents. Proposed ahead of the second impeachment of President Donald Trump after he provoked a mob into attacking the U.S. Capitol, the bill aims to prohibit burials in Arlington National Cemetery of former presidents who had been twice impeached.", "Snopes readers specifically interpreted this bill as one that sought to prohibit Trump from being buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, at the time of his death. We read the text of the bill, and learned that while Trump is not mentioned there by name, the bill presently only applies to him.", "The \u201cNo Glory For Hate Act\u201d states:", "[...] the Secretary of Defense shall not approve a determination of eligibility for interment or inurnment in Arlington National Cemetery made by the Secretary of the Army that permits the interment or inurnment in Arlington National Cemetery of any former President that has been twice impeached by the House of Representatives on or before the date of enactment of this Act or has been convicted of a State or Federal crime relating to actions taken in an official capacity as President of the United States.", "This clearly does not name Trump, but explicitly refers to any former president that has been twice impeached by the House of Representatives. Presently, Trump is the first and only former president who fits that description.", "The bill also calls for preventing the use of federal funds to be used to \u201cname, designate, or redesignate a Federal building or Federal land after, or in commemoration of\u201d such a president, and to \u201ccreate or display any symbol, monument, or statue commemorating\u201d the president. Presently it has only been introduced in the House and no other actions have been taken surrounding it.", "Only two former presidents are buried at Arlington National Cemetery: John F. Kennedy, and William Taft. Most presidents choose to be buried in their home states. The cemetery is primarily a burial ground for active duty military and retired reservists, recipients of the military\u2019s highest honors, and former prisoners of war.", "Given that the bill does not explicitly mention Trump, but does largely apply to Trump, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly True.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
