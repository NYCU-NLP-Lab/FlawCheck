["By Rem Rieder", "Posted on June 26, 2020", "In a June 24 tweet, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that his predecessor had \u201cdestroyed\u201d Maine\u2019s lobster and fishing industry.", "It is true\u00a0that, in an effort to protect a rich but delicate marine area, then-President Barack Obama in 2016\u00a0created\u00a0a nearly 5,000-square-mile marine monument off the New England coast to be off-limits to fishing and lobstering. But he grandfathered\u00a0in lobster and crab harvesting for seven years \u2014 so there has been absolutely no impact as of yet on the lobster industry. And statistics show that the rest of the fishing industry has hardly been destroyed.", "On June 5, Trump signed a proclamation opening up the monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument about 130 miles east-southeast off of Cape Cod, to commercial fishing. Trump said Obama had no reason to stop fishing in the area, and he was acting to \u201creverse that injustice.\u201d", "A few weeks later, Trump took to Twitter to make his false claim about the lobster industry:", "Pres. Obama destroyed the lobster and fishing industry in Maine. Now it\u2019s back, bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible. Enjoy your \u201clobstering\u201d and fishing! Make lots of money!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2020", "Just after midnight the following day, Trump followed up with this tweet:", "It was my great honor to free up 5000 square miles of ocean off the coast of Maine. Enjoy!", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2020", "Obama\u2019s action in creating the sanctuary was applauded by environmentalists but opposed by Maine fishermen. Trump\u2019s reversal of his initiative received the opposite reaction. But, as we said, commercial lobstering hadn\u2019t yet been affected by Obama\u2019s proclamation, and it\u2019s not clear that, even if it had gone into effect, a total ban on fishing in the monument would have had a huge impact on the overall industry.", "In 2017, Trump ordered the Interior Department to review national monuments to make sure that they had been properly classified as such. In July 2018, the Washington Post reported that Randal Bowman, the staff member overseeing the process,\u00a0suggested deleting language from the review that said most fishing vessels near the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument had \u201cgenerated 5% or less of their annual landings from within the monument.\u201d The passage should be removed because it \u201cundercuts the case for the ban being harmful,\u201d Bowman said in an email.", "Maine\u2019s lobster industry had a\u00a0record year\u00a0in 2016, Obama\u2019s last year in office, with a haul of 132 million pounds worth $540 million. In fact, the industry\u00a0did very well\u00a0during his eight-year tenure. This, of course, had little to do with Obama.", "It is true that the lobster haul has declined in the ensuing years. Preliminary data for 2019 pegs the haul at 101 million pounds worth $485 million. But Obama\u2019s action had nothing to do with it, since lobster fishing has been unaffected. His Sept. 15, 2016, proclamation said commercial fishing for red crab and American lobster would be exempted from prohibited activities until mid-September 2023. \u201cAfter 7 years, red crab and American lobster commercial fishing is prohibited in the monument,\u201d the proclamation said.", "As for Maine\u2019s overall fishing industry, 2016 was a big year as well, with a take of 303 million pounds worth $733 million. There was a falloff in 2019, but hardly a destruction of the industry. According to preliminary data, the catch was 217 million pounds worth $673 million. The lobster falloff from 2016 \u2013completely unaffected by Obama \u2014 of $55 million represented a huge proportion of the overall $60 million decline.", "All of which suggests that Obama\u2019s action had a relatively small effect on the fishing industry overall.", "Of course, there are many factors that affect the lobster industry, including the vagaries of the fishing harvest, climate change and trade developments. And now the industry, like the rest of the nation, is struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "One factor that hit Maine hard was Trump\u2019s tariffs on China. In retaliation, on July 6, 2018, China slapped tariffs on a number of U.S. products, including lobster. The tariffs, which went as high as 35%, dropped to 30% this year. So China, which enjoys its Maine lobster, began buying\u00a0lobster from Canada instead, a big blow to the Maine industry.", "In the first six months of 2019, the U.S. exported less than 2.2 million pounds of lobster to China, compared with 12 million pounds during the first six months of 2018, according to trade data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries. Maine accounts for nearly 90% of the U.S. lobster supply, according to the state.", "Trump is now moving to extend his farm bailout program to the lobster industry.", "Environmentalists were distraught that Trump had ended the fishing ban and worried about the impact on the aquatic ecosystem.", "\u201cThis rollback essentially sells off the future of the ocean and the future of the ecosystem for almost no present economic benefit,\u201d said Miriam Goldstein, the ocean policy director at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.", "But the fishing industry cheered his action.", "\u201cThe process by which this monument was established is a non-transparent process that does not allow for stakeholder input, does not \u2014 does not produce any kind of economic analysis of the negative impacts, and prevents all of us from enjoying the benefits of our healthy marine resources,\u201d said Maggie Raymond, executive director of the Associated Fisheries of Maine, at the June 5 roundtable in Bangor, Maine, where Trump announced his decision. \u201cSo, again, we appreciate that you\u2019ve recognized that and are taking action to correct that.\u201d", "We take no position on Trump\u2019s policy decision. But the evidence shows\u00a0he is wrong to claim Obama \u201cdestroyed\u201d the lobster industry \u2014 it hadn\u2019t yet been banned from the marine monument. And a review conducted by Trump\u2019s own administration found fishing vessels overall garnered a small percentage of their catch from that area.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
