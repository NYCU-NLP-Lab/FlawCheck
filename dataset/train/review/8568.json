["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on October 22, 2018", "Q: Were \u201ccharges filed\u201d against U.S. Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas for accepting an \u201cillegal $10 million campaign donation\u201d from CNN?", "A: No. A Libertarian opponent filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming CNN\u2019s town hall event with O\u2019Rourke was worth $10 million.", "Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas Democrat challenging Sen. Ted Cruz for his seat in the U.S. Senate, appeared in an hourlong town hall event on CNN on Oct. 18.", "Prior to the town hall, a false headline started circulating on Facebook saying: \u201cCHARGES FILED AGAINST BETO O\u2019ROURKE FOR ACCEPTING ILLEGAL $10 MILLION CONTRIBUTION.\u201d", "There were no \u201ccharges\u201d filed, but a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission about the CNN town hall with O\u2019Rourke.", "Here\u2019s what happened:", "On Oct. 11, CNN announced its lineup of political specials for the midterm elections. Among them was a town hall moderated by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash with O\u2019Rourke taking questions from the audience. A spokeswoman for CNN told FactCheck.org that the network had invited Cruz to appear in his own town hall program, but he declined.", "Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, confirmed in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0that Cruz was \u201cunable to participate\u201d in \u201cback to back town halls.\u201d But, Roe added, \u201cthe Cruz campaign proposed that @CNN host one of the Cruz-O\u2019Rourke debates.\u00a0The O\u2019Rourke campaign declined.\u201d", "Following CNN\u2019s programming announcement, Neal Dikeman, the\u00a0third candidate\u00a0in the race who is seeking the seat on the Libertarian line, wrote an\u00a0open letter\u00a0to CNN asking to be included in the televised town hall.", "Dikeman later\u00a0filed a complaint with the FEC against CNN and O\u2019Rourke, claiming that the town hall event would amount to an illegal $10 million campaign contribution if it aired as scheduled.", "In response, CNN attorney David C. Vigilante wrote a letter to Dikeman saying Cruz and O\u2019Rourke are the \u201conly two viable candidates,\u201d based on polling, and that the CNN town hall was within the \u201cpress exemption\u201d of campaign finance laws. Vigilante cited a case from 2009 that made similar allegations, which the FEC dismissed.", "So, while it\u2019s true that the FEC has gotten a complaint about the town hall program with O\u2019Rourke, no \u201ccharges\u201d have been filed against the candidate. And it\u2019s far from certain that the town hall could be considered an \u201cillegal $10 million contribution\u201d since the FEC hasn\u2019t yet ruled on the complaint.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\u00a0FactCheck.org also collaborates with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on fact-checking videos hosted by \u201cState of the Union\u201d anchor Jake Tapper.", "\u201cCHARGES FILED AGAINST BETO O\u2019ROURKE FOR ACCEPTING ILLEGAL $10 MILLION CONTRIBUTION.\u201d iamatexan.com. 16 Oct 2018.", "Ventresca, Rachel. \u201cCNN to host prime-time political events ahead of midterm elections.\u201d CNN. 11 Oct 2018.", "Dikeman, Neal.
