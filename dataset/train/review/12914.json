["About this rating", "On Jan. 20, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration speech included a clear rebuke of racism and white supremacy, unusual for inaugural addresses. In his speech, Biden denounced \u201cracism, nativism, fear, demonization,\u201d which propelled the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Conservative pundit Karl Rove was not a fan of that particular moment in the speech, according to an interview he gave on Fox News.", "In the 23-minute long speech, Biden said, \u201cOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart.\u201d He also said, \u201cA cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. A cry that can\u2019t be any more desperate or any more clear. And now a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\u201d", "After initially praising Biden\u2019s speech the day of the inauguration, Rove changed course in a Fox News interview the next day. He said:", "The racism thing to me is\u2014I was offended in the speech [...] I thought it was a good speech. It wasn\u2019t a great speech, but it was a good speech. It was the right speech for the moment. But there was a point in there where he said, \"We\u2019re divided as a country, between the people who believe in the American ideal and racism, nativism, and fear.\" No, no, no. We\u2019re divided as a country politically over questions of policy, and direction, and respect. But we\u2019re united as a country against racism and nativism. There are people in this country who are racist, there are people who are nativist, but the vast majority of Americans stand together on those issues, and that was an attempt to basically say, \"If you\u2019re not for me, you\u2019re part of the group that\u2019s racist, and nativist, and fear-mongering,\" which I didn\u2019t think was a good note to strike. But I think that\u2019s part of it also, to pay off to the left to the Democratic party. If everything is a problem, if every issue we face as a country has ultimately a root in racism then that\u2019s what the left believes and that\u2019s what he\u2019s willing to give them a rhetorical gift on.", "Given that Rove indeed said he was offended by a moment in Biden\u2019s speech that focused on racism in the country, we rate this claim a \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "Nur Nasreen Ibrahim is a reporter with experience working in television, international news coverage, fact checking, and creative writing.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
