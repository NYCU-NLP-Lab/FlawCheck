["By Lori Robertson", "Posted on October 1, 2019", "In recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested that Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, should be arrested for \u201ctreason\u201d and charged with \u201clying to Congress\u201d for mischaracterizing Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "Trump claims Schiff\u2019s opening remarks at a recent House intelligence committee hearing on the whistleblower complaint against him were \u201cillegally made up.\u201d Schiff said his retelling of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky was partly \u201cin parody.\u201d", "We\u2019ll leave it for readers to judge whether it was immediately clear that Schiff was purposefully giving his own dramatic representation that didn\u2019t completely square with the facts. But here\u2019s what we found about the statements the politicians have made about each other:", "Trump\u2019s comments refer to Schiff\u2019s statement preceding the Sept. 26 testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The day before, the White House had released\u00a0a memo of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, a call that is highlighted in an Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint against the president. The memo shows Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.", "In the Sept. 26 House hearing, Schiff gave his own spin on the memo, saying this was \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates\u201d in his call with Zelensky \u201cin not so many words.\u201d", "Later in the same hearing, Schiff said the summary \u201cwas meant to be at least part in parody.\u201d", "Here\u2019s Schiff\u2019s summary:", "Schiff, Sept. 26: It reads like a classic organized crime shakedown. Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates. We\u2019ve been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you though. And I\u2019m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand. Lots of it. On this and on that. I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people, not just any people, I am going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the United States, my Attorney General Bill Barr. He\u2019s got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I\u2019m going to put you in touch with Rudy. You\u2019re going to love him. Trust me. You know what I\u2019m asking. And so I\u2019m only going to say this a few more times. In a few more ways. And by the way, don\u2019t call me again. I\u2019ll call you when you\u2019ve done what I asked.", "This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine. It would be funny if it wasn\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s oath of office. But as it does represent a real betrayal, there\u2019s nothing the president says here that is in America\u2019s interest after all.", "It\u2019s possible some viewers didn\u2019t pick up on Schiff\u2019s cue that he was giving his interpretation of the \u201cessence\u201d of the call. But it was clear to Republican Rep. Mike Turner.", "Later in the hearing, Turner said Schiff was \u201cjust making it up\u201d and the American people were smart enough to know that. \u201cWhile the chairman was speaking I actually had someone text me, \u2018Is he just making this up?\u2019 And yes, he was. Because sometimes fiction is better than the actual words or the text. But luckily the American public are smart, and they have the transcript. They\u2019ve read the conversation; they know when someone\u2019s just making it up.\u201d", "Schiff responded: \u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least part in parody. The fact that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said if you don\u2019t understand me, I\u2019m going to say it seven more times. My point is that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d", "In remarks at the White House on Sept. 30, Trump said Schiff \u201cactually took words and made it up.\u201d And that\u2019s correct. Schiff didn\u2019t give Trump\u2019s exact words \u2014 which aren\u2019t available. Nor does Schiff give the exact words in the memo, which stipulates that it represents the \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of staff \u201cassigned to listen and memorialize the conversation.\u201d", "Trump continued: \u201cThe reason is, when he saw my call to the president of Ukraine, it was so good that he couldn\u2019t quote from it because it \u2014 there was nothing done wrong. It was perfect.\u201d But Schiff could have quoted from it and conveyed some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the same information that he included in his crime-novel version.", "The president said in a tweet that Schiff\u2019s comments \u201cbore NO relationship to what I said on the call.\u201d That\u2019s incorrect. There are some parts of the chairman\u2019s comments that are similar to the memo of the phone call and other parts that aren\u2019t at all.", "For instance, Schiff claims Trump told Zelensky, \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you though.\u201d", "That bears a relationship to the White House-released memo. According to the memo, Trump said: \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. \u2026 [T]he United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\u201d", "After Zelensky responded, saying, \u201cYes you are absolutely right,\u201d that he had spoken to German and French leaders about doing more on \u201csanctions\u201d against Russia and that Ukraine was \u201calmost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes,\u201d Trump asked for \u201ca favor.\u201d", "\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said, according to the memo, asking that Zelensky look into CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC after its computer network was hacked. (That\u2019s a reference to a conspiracy theory that former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said he explained to the president had been \u201ccompletely debunked.\u201d)", "During the call, Trump also asked Zelensky to look into former Vice President Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son, Hunter. \u201cThe other thing, [t]here\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d the memo says. (We\u2019ve looked into it, and there\u2019s no evidence that \u201cBiden stopped the prosecution.\u201d See \u201cTrump Twists Facts on Biden and Ukraine\u201d for more.)", "The memo also shows that Trump told Zelensky he\u2019d have his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr call Zelensky \u2014 though not in the words Schiff used. \u201cMr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General,\u201d Trump said, according to the memo.", "But Schiff\u2019s parody was outright false, as even Schiff partly acknowledged, in saying: \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand. Lots of it. On this and on that.\u201d", "The memo doesn\u2019t show Trump saying anything about \u201cseven times,\u201d nor does the president ask Zelensky to \u201cmake up dirt\u201d on Biden.", "The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 21, citing anonymous sources, that Trump had urged Zelensky \u201cabout eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent.\u201d But the \u201ceight times\u201d detail hasn\u2019t been corroborated.", "Schiff has reiterated his claim that Trump had asked Zelensky to \u201cmake up\u201d information. On CNN on Sept. 25, he said: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it enough that the president has admitted to pressuring a foreign nation to dig up or manufacture dirt on his opponent?\u201d And on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sept. 29, Schiff referred to the president \u201ccoercing Ukraine to dig up dirt on his opponent or manufacture it.\u201d", "We asked Schiff\u2019s office how he could claim that Trump had asked Zelensky to \u201cmake up\u201d or \u201cmanufacture\u201d dirt on Biden. That\u2019s not in the memo of the call, which only says Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cfind out what happened\u201d and \u201cget to the bottom of\u201d CrowdStrike and \u201cthe server\u201d and told the Ukrainian president that \u201ca lot of people want to find out about [the Bidens] so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.\u201d", "Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff, told us: \u201cThe Ukrainian government has already completed an investigation into this matter,\u201d referring to the Bidens, \u201cwhich resulted in no charges or allegations of wrongdoing. And as a result, any further investigation undertaken under pressure from the president and his agent would be to tarnish and manufacture dirt on a political opponent.\u201d", "That\u2019s Schiff\u2019s interpretation.", "Trump also hasn\u2019t \u201cadmitted\u201d to \u201cpressuring\u201d Zelensky, as Schiff said on CNN.", "Schiff\u2019s dramatic parody doesn\u2019t reflect the memo of the call when he said, \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t call me again. I\u2019ll call you when you\u2019ve done what I asked.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t say anything like that, according to the memo. Instead, the memo shows Trump telling Zelensky: \u201cWhenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we\u2019ll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.\u201d", "We\u2019d recommend readers take a look at the full White House memo, rather than the political theater surrounding it.", "Trump tweeted on Sept. 29 that Schiff should be \u201cquestioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\u201d and charged Schiff with \u201clying to Congress.\u201d The president posed the treason issue as a question on Sept. 30, tweeting, \u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d Social media posts have echoed Trump\u2019s claims.", "But \u201ctreason,\u201d defined by the Constitution, is giving \u201caid and comfort\u201d to \u201cenemies\u201d of the United States, or \u201clevying war\u201d against the U.S. It\u2019s \u201cthe only crime expressly defined by the Constitution,\u201d write Paul T. Crane, with the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division, and Deborah Pearlstein, a professor at Yeshiva University Cardozo Law School, for the National Constitution Center. The framers included the treason clause, they note, \u201cnot so much to underscore the seriousness of such a betrayal, but to guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition.\u201d", "The Constitution requires an \u201covert act.\u201d It reads: \u201cNo Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\u201d Crane and Pearlstein explain: \u201cThe \u2018overt act\u2019 requirement was designed both to limit the kind of substantive behavior treason could punish \u2014 only conduct, not mere expression \u2014 and to ensure that the conduct itself demonstrated a defendant\u2019s intention to betray the United States.\u201d", "Trump again tweeted about Schiff on Oct. 1, asking why Schiff wasn\u2019t \u201cbeing brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress,\u201d in other words, perjury charges.", "As we\u2019ve written before, perjury requires intent to deceive.\u00a0Federal law says a person commits perjury when he or she is under oath and \u201cwillfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true.\u201d", "Schiff didn\u2019t portray his summary of the call as true. He said at the beginning of his remarks, \u201cShorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates.\u201d And at the end, he added, \u201cThis is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
