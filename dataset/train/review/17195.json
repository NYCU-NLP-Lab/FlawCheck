["By Jessica McDonald, Eugene Kiely and D'Angelo Gore", "Posted on July 10, 2019", "In a July 8 speech dedicated to the environment, President Donald Trump made a series of misleading or false statements as he played up the U.S.\u2019s environmental achievements, many of which predate his time as commander-in-chief.", "In remarks at the White House,\u00a0the president and his top aides cast the administration\u2019s environmental record in a positive light.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re making tremendous environmental progress under President Trump, and the public needs to know that,\u201d said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who was a\u00a0lobbyist for coal and other energy companies.", "But many of the environmental victories Trump cited have been in the works for years or decades, such as the cleanup of Superfund sites or the court-ordered EPA regulations.", "The president spoke of\u00a0\u201crevising the past administration\u2019s misguided regulations to better protect the environment and to protect our American workers,\u201d without specifying the impact of his\u00a0many\u00a0regulatory rollbacks.", "Trump has declined to support or sought to undo many of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature environmental policies, including the Clean Power Plan. By the EPA\u2019s own calculations, Trump\u2019s replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy rule, provides very few carbon emissions reductions.", "The Trump administration has also proposed freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through 2026 \u2014 an action the EPA says would increase CO2 emissions by 7.4 billion metric tons by the year 2100.", "The president also did not mention that he has proposed\u00a0hefty cuts\u00a0to the EPA\u2019s budget each year, most recently proposing a 31% cut in fiscal year 2020 \u2014 including a 9 percent cut, or\u00a0$109 million, to the Superfund program that Trump touted in his speech.", "The president falsely claimed that his administration last year completed a record number of Superfund cleanups.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve refocused the EPA back on its core mission,\u201d he said, \u201cand, last year, the agency completed more Superfund hazardous waste cleanups than any year of the previous administrations and set records in almost every year. We have done tremendous work on Superfunds.\u201d", "But\u00a0there are several other years when the agency has removed more sites from the Superfund list than it did in 2018.", "By calendar year, 2018 had 17 full site deletions; by fiscal year, which ran from Oct. 1, 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, there were 18. When including partial deletions, the tally rises to 22 for fiscal year 2018. This is the number the EPA likes to cite, noting that it is more deletions in any year since fiscal year 2005. An EPA spokesman told us this is what the president was referring to. But the figure is not a historical record.", "In calendar year 1996, the EPA removed\u00a045 Superfund sites, or 34 when counting by fiscal year. Fiscal years 1997 and 2001 also each had more than 30 Superfund deletions. And every calendar year between 1995 and 2001 had at least 19 deletions. In 2017, there\u00a0were just three calendar year deletions and two fiscal year deletions.\u00a0So far in 2019, only one site has been deleted.", "As we\u2019ve also noted before, Superfund cleanups often take decades to complete, so it\u2019s inaccurate for Trump to take full credit for these deletions. In fact, of the 18 fully deleted sites in fiscal year 2018, all completed physical cleanup before 2016 and only two were made ready for reuse after 2016. The ready-for-reuse stage, regional EPA spokespeople\u00a0previously\u00a0told us, occurs when all of the remediation is complete and what\u2019s left is contamination monitoring and paperwork.", "Trump did not once say \u201cclimate change\u201d in his speech. But he did tout the nation\u2019s progress over the past nearly two decades on reducing carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 even though Energy Information Administration\u00a0data show energy-related CO2 emissions were 1.9% higher in 2018 than they were in 2016.", "Trump, July 8:\u00a0Since 2000, our nation\u2019s energy-related carbon emissions have declined more than any other country on Earth.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 Emissions are projected to drop in 2019 and 2020.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing a very tough job and not everybody knows it, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re here today to speak to you.\u00a0 Every single one of the signatories to the Paris Climate Accord lags behind America in overall emissions reductions.", "Trump\u2019s statistic is accurate, but it\u2019s misleading because it refers to an absolute reduction in emissions, rather than a percent reduction. Absolute reductions fail to account for differences in population size or starting levels of emissions, rendering international comparisons meaningless.", "The factoid may have come from the International Energy Agency, which noted in its 2018 report that despite rising in 2018, \u201cemissions in the United States remain around their 1990 levels, 14% and 800 Mt [million metric tons] of CO2 below their peak in 2000. This is the largest absolute decline among all countries since 2000.\u201d (Note: While IEA data shows that peak emissions were in 2000, the EIA says that milestone occurred\u00a0in 2007. Either way, the drop is around 14%.)", "While impressive, more than 10 other nations participating in the Paris Agreement have posted higher percent declines. IEA data, for example, shows\u00a0Denmark\u2019s emissions fell a whopping 34% between 2000 and 2016, while the United Kingdom and France posted declines of 29% and 20%, respectively.", "Many industrialized nations taking part in the Paris Agreement have no chance of besting the U.S. on this particular bragging right. That\u2019s because most of these nations are small relative to the U.S., and their residents already produce relatively few emissions per capita.", "In some cases, it\u2019s not even possible. In 2000, for example, France\u2019s total emissions couldn\u2019t have dropped by 800 million metric tons because they were only 365 million metric tons to begin with.", "As the IEA report highlights, Trump also omits the fact that CO2 emissions rose in 2018, which the EIA attributed to \u201cweather and continued economic growth.\u201d", "Finally, Trump took credit for expected emissions reductions this and next year.\u00a0\u201cEmissions are projected to drop in 2019 and 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a very tough job and not everybody knows it, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re here today to speak to you.\u201d", "But according to the EIA, those drops are expected because of \u201cmilder weather \u2026\u00a0and, consequently, less energy consumption.\u201d\u00a0The agency says that even with two back-to-back declines, emissions are not projected to fall below 2017 levels.", "The president also highlighted some recent EPA regulations designed to protect children from lead exposure. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there is no safe blood lead level in children.", "Trump, July 8: And for the first time in nearly 30 years, we\u2019re in the process of strengthening national drinking water standards to protect vulnerable children from lead and copper exposure \u2014 something that has not been done, and we\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 And last month, our EPA took the first major action in nearly two decades to reduce exposure to lead-contaminated dust.", "Trump may very well be the first administration in almost three decades to substantially update the lead and copper rule, a 1991 regulation pertaining to drinking water. A proposed rule is expected in July.", "But that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. According to the EPA, there were revisions to the rule in 2007\u00a0\u201cto enhance implementation in the areas of monitoring, treatment, customer awareness, and lead service line replacement.\u201d", "And the Obama administration conducted many of the preliminary actions, including a 2016 white paper outlining potential revisions.\u00a0The Trump EPA repeatedly has delayed issuing the standards.", "Trump also presents the rule on lead dust as an administrative initiative. But the lead-dust regulation was court-ordered, and health advocates say the resulting standards don\u2019t go far enough.", "The final lead dust rule, which the EPA announced on June 21 and has yet to take effect, lowers the amount of lead dust allowed on floors and window sills in childcare centers and homes built before 1978 \u2014 the year the federal government banned lead paint in homes.", "In December 2017, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the agency to review the standards \u201cin light of the obvious need.\u201d", "The lawsuit was filed during the Obama administration. But the Trump EPA fought the petition in June of 2017, and according to the decision, offered \u201ca vague intention to issue a proposed rule in four years and a final rule in six\u201d \u2014 a timeline the court considered \u201cunreasonable.\u201d The court gave the EPA 90 days to produce a proposed rule and an additional year to produce a final rule.", "The new rule lowers the hazard levels, making them more stringent. But it kept in place higher clearance levels, or the standards that would have to be met after a lead removal project. This discrepancy has activists concerned that the regulation will fail to keep kids safe, according to\u00a0E&E News, an energy and environment news site.", "Trump suggested that his administration was responsible for the U.S. placing first in drinking water rankings determined by university researchers.", "\u201cAnd today, the United States is ranked \u2014 listen to this \u2014 number one in the world for access to clean drinking water,\u201d Trump said, after mentioning several things he said happened since he was elected or became president.", "The White House told us Trump was referring to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which scores countries based on their performances in a number of categories covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality. It is jointly produced by Yale and Columbia universities in collaboration with the World Economic Forum.", "The most recent EPI does show that the U.S. was tops in drinking water along with nine other countries. The drinking water indicator, the report says, is measured \u201cas the proportion of a country\u2019s population exposed to health risks from their access to drinking water, defined by the primary water source used by households and the household water treatment, or the treatment that happens at the point of water collection.\u201d", "But America\u2019s score is not based on anything Trump has done as president.", "The 2018 EPI report \u2014 which was published in January 2018 \u2014 says the data used for the sanitation and drinking water indicators predates the Trump administration. The EPI\u2019s technical appendix designates 2016 as the year supporting the current scores for the drinking water category.", "Trump repeated his misleading and exaggerated claim that the Green New Deal will \u201ccost our economy nearly $100 trillion.\u201d\u00a0As we have written, Trump is referring to a nonbinding resolution introduced\u00a0in the House by Democratic\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.", "As a \u201csimple resolution,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s measure would not cost anything. The House hasn\u2019t taken up the resolution but, even if it passed, it would not go the Senate or to the president for his signature. It merely recognizes that climate change is a problem and\u00a0calls for the U.S. to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions through a \u201c10-year national mobilization.\u201d", "In addition, the $100 trillion is a high-end, rounded up\u00a0estimate that comes from a conservative nonprofit policy group and coauthored by John McCain\u2019s chief economic adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign.", "The estimate \u2014 which actually ranges from\u00a0$51 trillion to $93 trillion between 2020 and 2029 \u2014 only includes costs, and doesn\u2019t account for economic benefits or other effects. Experts have told us that attempting to put a specific price on the resolution is misleading, since the Green New Deal is so vague.", "The Senate resolution, which was introduced by Sen. Ed Markey,\u00a0failed to get a single supporter in a procedural vote taken in March.", "In claiming that his administration is \u201cproving\u201d that \u201ca strong economy and a vibrant energy sector\u201d is compatible with \u201ca healthy environment,\u201d the president boasted that the level for particulate matter is \u201csix times lower here than the global average.\u201d The U.S. level is low, but the global average he cites is skewed by high levels of dust in countries located in North Africa and the Middle East.", "Trump, July 8:\u00a0One of the main [measures] of air pollution \u2014 particulate matter \u2014 is six times lower here than the global average.\u00a0 So we hear so much about some countries and what everyone is doing.\u00a0 We\u2019re six times lower than the average.\u00a0 That\u2019s a tremendous number.", "The EPA told us that Trump was referring to a World Health Organization\u2019s 2019\u00a0global air quality report on fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, which are particles 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller.", "Trump has a point.\u00a0\u201cThe 10 countries with the lowest national PM2.5 exposure levels were the Maldives, the United States, Norway, Estonia, Iceland, Canada, Sweden, New Zealand, Brunei, and Finland. Population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations averaged 8 \u00b5g/m3 or less in these countries,\u201d according to the 2019 report, which was based on 2017 data.", "The global average, weighted by population, was\u00a046\u00a0micrograms per cubic meter, or ug/m3, which is about six times higher than the U.S. level of 7.4 ug/m3. However, the report also indicates that the global average is skewed by high levels of dust \u2014 not industrial pollution \u2014 in some countries.", "\u201cThe sources responsible for PM2.5 pollution vary within and between countries and regions,\u201d the report said. \u201cDust from the Sahara Desert contributes to the high particulate matter concentrations in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as to the high concentrations in some countries in western sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d", "The regional average levels were higher than the global averages in North Africa and the Middle East (55 micrograms per cubic meter) and the western sub-Saharan Africa (59\u00a0micrograms per cubic meter). That includes countries such as Niger (94\u00a0ug/m3), Egypt (87 ug/m3) and Chad (66 ug/m3).", "By contrast, the regional average for Western Europe was just 12 ug/m3, and includes four countries \u2014 Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden \u2014 that had lower levels of\u00a0PM2.5 pollution than the United States.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
