According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the nation's entire 2007 national defense budget \u2014 which includes atomic energy and defense-related activities in the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State and Commerce \u2014 is $570 billion. That's about 4.2 percent of GDP. So, Huckabee's off, but not by much.", "Here's the bigger problem. In his statement, Huckabee seems to be comparing federal government spending on the military to total spending in the U.S. on health care. Not just government money, but also private spending.", "His campaign didn't return phone calls to explain what he meant or from where he drew his statistics. But his 17 percent of GDP most closely resembles a figure cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for administering health programs. It reported in January 2007 that the U.S. is projected to spend about 16.2 percent of GDP on national health expenditures this year, or about $2.3-trillion.", "But that's everything. What the federal government spends, what state and local governments spend, what private citizens spend.", "The same study shows that if you subtract private sector money from the equation, health care expenses by the federal government drop to 5.5 percent of GDP. Add in state and local government spending and you get to 7.6 percent of GDP.", "Of course, \"we,\" all of us, make up the private sector. So Huckabee has every right to include the private with public expenses when citing the true cost of U.S. health care in proportion to GDP.\nBut comparing that with government-only spending on the military, or anything else, artificially inflates the disparity between the two costs.", "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\nU.S. Health Spending Estimates Through 2005\n\nJan. 7, 2007", "Office of Management and Budget,\n\nHistorical Table 3.1, Outlays by Superfunction and Function: 1940-2012", "National Defense Budget,\n\nFiscal Year 2008", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
