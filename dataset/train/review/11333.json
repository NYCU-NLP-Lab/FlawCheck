["About this rating", "Since at least 2019, TikTok has sort of become the modern-day, go-to spot for watching videos that purportedly expose or reveal secrets about a variety of topics.", "We previously covered TikTok videos that revealed Chick-fil-A's nuggets prep process and \"exposed\" Panera Bread's frozen soups and other foods. We even debunked a TikTok video that claimed to reveal zombies found on Google Earth. So it came as no surprise when a TikTok video claimed to reveal how to unlock any iPhone \u2014 the same device used by millions of people to view said TikTok videos.", "On Dec. 7, 2020, TikTok user @f_y_._p posted a video that claimed to show \"How to Unlock Anybody's iPhone.\" After three days, it had been viewed nearly 4 million times.", "The video showed what appeared to be a child covering the top of an iPhone to stop facial recognition from automatically unlocking the device.
