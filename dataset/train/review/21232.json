["The clip, which has drawn thousands of views including in\u00a0India and\u00a0Africa,\u00a0alleges that the test involves holding your breath as a red dot moves from one point of a square to another.", "\u201cIf you can hold your breath as per the timing of the red dot moving from A to B, then you can be free of Corona,\u201d reads the Hindi text on a video shared by a Facebook page managed from Palestine.", "\u201cBreathe, relax, breathe,\u201d it says. \u201cCovid test only for 2,200 Indian Rupees (as per the rate fixed by Rajasthan government).\u201d", "Included in the video\u2019s information is a phone number for Ananta Hospital in the northwest of India.", "Similar posts were shared here, here and here.", "In Kenya and South Africa, the claim circulated on WhatsApp as a forwarded message reading: \u201cIf you can hold your breath till the red dot moves from A to B you are Covid 19 free at the moment. Simple covid test. Free Trial at no cost. Help Save a Life. Wait till the red dot moves to A before you start holding your breath (sic).\u201d", "According to the claim, being able to hold\u00a0your breath as the red dot takes about 25 seconds to move from one point to another\u00a0is proof that your lungs are \u201chealthy and disease-resistant\u201d.", "However, the claim is false.", "The World Health Organization (WHO) told AFP Fact Check that the technique \u201cdoes not tell you if you have COVID-19\u201d.", "\u201cThis appears to be a simple app that measures time and not airflow. People with lung disease (from smoking, pollution, asthma, COPD or pulmonary infection, including but of course not limited to COVID-19) would have a harder time doing this.\u00a0 It seems harmless, but not very informative, a crude measure of lung function,\u201d WHO said in an email.", "Dr Peter Waweru, a pulmonologist in Nairobi, Kenya, also dismissed the claim, noting that a breathing test is not reliable when testing the presence or absence of the virus that causes COVID-19.", "\u201cThis is not accurate at all. Breathing cannot be used to test COVID-19. The lungs can have numerous infections and a breathing test is not sufficient to determine whether one has COVID-19 or not. We have seen people whose lungs have not been affected by the virus yet they have tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d Waweru told AFP Fact Check.", "Dr Amba Lal Salve, a medical superintendent at Ananta Hospital, told AFP Fact Check in India that the institution was not behind the message on the video, which used legitimate information on Ananta Hospital\u2019s Facebook page, including its\u00a0phone number and the price of a COVID-19 test.", "\u201cThe video does not belong to the hospital and we have no idea who made it,\u201d Salve said.", "AFP Fact Check previously explained the different tests used to diagnose COVID-19 here.", "Follow us", "Copyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2023.
