["About this rating", "Televangelist Pat Robertson has a history of making controversial remarks in the wake of both human-made and natural disasters. In October 2017, for example, he placed some of the blame for a mass shooting in Las Vegas on Americans who, in Robertson's view, showed disrespect to law enforcement, U.S. President Donald Trump, and the American flag. The televangelist has also blamed the sinful for provoking God's anger after natural disasters, such as the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in 2010.", "So when social media users came across an article in April 2019 that claimed Robertson had said the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was the result of \"Hell bubbling over with homosexuals,\" some readers found the headline plausible:", "Moments after reports came in that the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was burning, televangelist Pat Robertson took to the CBN airwaves to advance a theory to viewers that the fire that engulfed the legendary parish was a result of \u201cHellfire spilling over from all the gays burning in it\u2019s darkest recesses.\u201d", "\u201cIt was bound to happen. This is all written in the Bible. We as a society just let everything be gay this and gay that,\u201d lamented the minister. \u201cSoon enough, there\u2019s just too many homosexuals, and when all those surplus homosexuals started to die, Hell commenced with a burning so bright, so intense, there was bound to be some that would spill over to the Earth.\u201d", "This text did not originate with a genuine news report, and this quote was not actually spoken by Robertson.
