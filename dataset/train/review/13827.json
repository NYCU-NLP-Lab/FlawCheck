["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on May 3, 2017", "Hillary Clinton, who declared that she is \u201cnow back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance,\u201d falsely claimed that no debate moderator ever asked Donald Trump, \u201cso exactly how are you going to create more jobs\u201d? It was asked in two of the three presidential debates.", "In the first debate at Hofstra University, NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt devoted a segment to what he called \u201cAchieving prosperity.\u201d Holt opened by generally asking both candidates how they would create jobs, and then he followed up twice by pressing Trump to specifically explain how he planned to bring back manufacturing jobs.", "Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace also asked both candidates about their jobs plans in the final debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He asked Trump \u201cwhy will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\u2019s?\u201d\u00a0Wallace also pressed Trump to defend his promise that he would create 25 million jobs and grow the energy industry at a time of low oil prices.", "Clinton made her remarks at the 2017 Women for Women International annual luncheon on May 2 during an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. The former Democratic presidential nominee talked about the 2016 campaign. She boasted about winning the popular vote, although she exaggerated a bit when she said: \u201cAnd remember, I did win more than three million [more] votes than my opponent.\u201d\u00a0 In fact, she received\u00a0nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump. She also discussed the reasons for her Electoral College defeat and, at one point, criticized the debate moderators for letting Trump off easy.", "Clinton, May 2:\u00a0So I was very proud of the policies we put forth. You know, I kept waiting for the moment \u2014 I, you know, I\u2019ve watched a million presidential debates in my life and I was waiting for the moment when one of the people asking the questions would have said, well, so exactly how are you going to create more jobs, right?\u00a0\u2026 I thought at some moment that would happen.", "But it did happen. Twice. Both Holt and Wallace devoted an extensive part of their debates to job creation and\u00a0the economy.\u00a0Trump told both moderators that he would create jobs by renegotiating trade deals, cutting regulations, reducing business taxes, and repatriating corporate cash held overseas.", "Clinton may not have liked Trump\u2019s answers, but the debate moderators asked the questions and Trump responded.", "In the first of three debates between Clinton and Trump, the moderator divided the 90-minute event into six segments that covered three topics:\u00a0Achieving prosperity, America\u2019s direction and securing America.", "Holt started with achieving prosperity and the first question was about jobs, asking both candidates, \u201cWhy are you a better choice than your opponent to create [jobs]\u201d?", "For the sake of brevity, we will provide some\u00a0relevant excerpts from that debate here. An annotated transcript of the full debate (where we note instances when the candidates gave false or misleading answers) can be found on our transcript page.", "Holt, Sept. 26, 2016: We\u2019re calling this opening segment \u201cAchieving Prosperity.\u201d And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There\u2019s been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.", "Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?", "Clinton: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.", "The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\u2019ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.", "I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work.", "I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.", "And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\u2019ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\u2019re under. So let\u2019s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\u2019s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.", "How are we going to do it? We\u2019re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.", "Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\u2019s good to be with you. We\u2019re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.", "Holt: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It\u2019s about putting money\u2014more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.", "Trump: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They\u2019re going to Mexico. They\u2019re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They\u2019re devaluing their currency, and there\u2019s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they\u2019re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.", "So we\u2019re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what\u2019s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world. They\u2019re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.", "So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\u2019re all leaving. And we can\u2019t allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we\u2019re going to do, but perhaps we\u2019ll be talking about that later.", "But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left\u2014fired 1,400 people. They\u2019re going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.", "We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I\u2019ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That\u2019s going to be a job creator like we haven\u2019t seen since Ronald Reagan. It\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing to watch.", "Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.", "\u2026", "Holt: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You\u2019ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you\u2019ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?", "Trump: Well, for one thing\u2014and before we start on that\u2014my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that\u2019s worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that\u2019s the kind of thinking that our country needs.", "Our country\u2019s in deep trouble. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They\u2019re the best, the best ever at it. What they\u2019re doing to us is a very, very sad thing.", "So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they\u2019re taking our jobs, they\u2019re giving incentives, they\u2019re doing things that, frankly, we don\u2019t do.", "Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We\u2019re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there\u2019s a tax. When they sell in\u2014automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there\u2019s no tax. It\u2019s a defective agreement. It\u2019s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven\u2019t done anything about it.", "Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton\u2014yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\u2019s very important to me.", "But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn\u2019t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact\u2026", "Holt: Let me interrupt just a moment, but\u2026", "Trump: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we\u2019ve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What\u2019s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is\u2014look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.", "Holt: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back \u2014 specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?", "Trump: Well, the first thing you do is don\u2019t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They\u2019re leaving, and they\u2019re leaving in bigger numbers than ever.", "And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you\u2019re wrong.", "And once you say you\u2019re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I\u2019m saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that\u2019s a big, big factor.", "\u2026", "Holt: We\u2019re going to move to\u2026", "Clinton: But it\u2019s because I see this \u2014 we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.", "So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.", "Trump: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you\u2019re going to increase regulations all over the place.", "And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I\u2019m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.", "When I go around \u2014 Lester, I tell you this, I\u2019ve been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing\u2014the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I\u2019m cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.", "I\u2019m going to cut regulations. I\u2019m going to cut taxes big league, and you\u2019re going to raise taxes big league, end of story.", "Holt: Let me get you to pause right there, because we\u2019re going to move into \u2014 we\u2019re going to move into the next segment.", "Wallace began the third debate by asking the candidates about their views on the Constitution and how the Supreme Court should interpret it \u2014 leading to other questions about the Second Amendment, gun laws, and abortion. He then asked about immigration and the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee before pivoting to the economy.", "Wallace asked Trump \u201cwhy will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\u2019s?\u201d", "The moderator also pressed Trump to defend his job-creation promises, telling the GOP nominee that \u201ceven conservative economists\u201d believe it\u2019s unrealistic for Trump to expect that he can grow the economy at an annual rate of 4 percent, create 25 million jobs and grow the energy industry at a time of low oil prices.", "Here are relevant excerpts taken from our annotated transcript of the full debate:", "Wallace, Oct. 19, 2016:\u00a0We\u2019re going to \u2014 no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.", "Trump: Yes.", "Wallace: We\u2019re going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent\u2019s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.", "Clinton: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.", "I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not\u2014who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.", "I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.", "And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.", "That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.", "So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.", "Wallace: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\u2019s?", "Trump:\u00a0Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I\u2019m a big proponent. We\u2019re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public\u2019s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan.", "But I\u2019d like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I\u2019m\u2014not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\u2019t they paying?", "She immediately\u2014when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned\u2014why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying.", "Since I did this\u2014this was a year ago\u2014all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying. And I\u2019ve been given a lot\u2014a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\u2019re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\u2019re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\u2019m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.", "She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.", "We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion.", "So my plan\u2014we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.", "You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back.", "I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal\u2014then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going\u2014we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal.", "And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it\u2014we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We\u2019re going to cut business taxes massively. They\u2019re going to start hiring people. We\u2019re going to bring the $2.5 trillion\u2026", "Wallace: Time, Mr. Trump.", "Trump:\u00a0\u2026 that\u2019s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because\u2026", "Wallace: Mr. Trump?", "Trump:\u00a0\u2026 right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.", "Clinton:\u00a0Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because\u2026", "Trump:\u00a0You can\u2019t.", "Trump: \u2026 the fact is, he\u2019s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we\u2019ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.", "I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.", "Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.", "So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\u2019s the kind of approach that will work.", "Wallace:\u00a0Secretary\u2026", "Clinton:\u00a0Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we\u2019ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.", "\u2026", "Wallace: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don\u2019t add up, that your idea, and you\u2019ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent\u2026", "Trump:\u00a0Over a 10-year period.", "Wallace: \u2026 growth is unrealistic. And they say\u2014you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that\u2019s unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?", "Trump: So I just left some high representatives of India. They\u2019re growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.", "We are growing\u2014our last report came out\u2014and it\u2019s right around the 1 percent level. And I think it\u2019s going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.", "Look, our country is stagnant. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. We\u2019ve lost our businesses. We\u2019re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.", "I\u2019ve visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I\u2019ve gotten to know so many\u2014I\u2019ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what\u2019s happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what\u2019s happened to these people in these communities.", "Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn\u2019t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that\u2019s ever been signed by our country.", "Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn\u2019t call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.", "FactCheck.org Rating:", "Read More", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
