["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on April 10, 2020", "Posts across social media are falsely claiming that a vaccine trial for the novel coronavirus in Senegal resulted in the death of seven children. The video behind those claims does not show that. And there is no clinical trial for a potential vaccine currently taking place in Senegal.", "There is no vaccine developed yet for the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, though some clinical tests for potential vaccines are underway in the U.S. and China.", "But a falsehood circulating across social media platforms \u2014 spread through numerous posts,\u00a0headlines and screenshots \u2014 is wrongly purporting that seven children in Senegal died after being given an experimental vaccine for the virus.", "\u201cMass vaccination for COVID-19 in Senegal was started yesterday (4/8) and the first 7 CHILDREN who received it DIED on the spot,\u201d a Facebook post reads. An Instagram post from an account called \u201cbye_bye_big_pharma\u201d says that \u201cCV vaccine tested in patients in Africa started yesterday. (4/8/2020) It was passed without any animal safety studies. 7 children died on the spot after injection.\u201d", "That\u2019s not true.", "There is no clinical trial currently underway in that country, or anywhere in Africa, according to a list of vaccine candidates compiled for the scientific journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. As of April 8, there were 115 candidates worldwide \u2014 and while 78 were confirmed as active, only five are in the clinical trial phase. Those five trials are happening in the U.S. and China.", "The false claim appears to stem from a viral video that shows a crowd of people in a street near a police car.

He vaccinated seven people, children. Seven children. They immediately died. They dropped dead.\u201d It further says the police are on the scene.", "But the speaker\u2019s claims evidently were added to the original video, which told a very different story.", "AFP Senegal found the video in a late March news report in that country \u2014 and it didn\u2019t say that anybody had died. Instead, the video appeared in a story about the alleged arrest of two individuals claiming they had vaccines.", "That video \u2014 which is in Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal \u2014 does not claim that any children died, according to Omar Ka, an associate professor of modern languages, linguistics and intercultural communication at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.", "\u201cThe difference between the French version and the Wolof one is that the latter does not talk about children being killed,\u201d Ka told us in an email. \u201cIt simply states that an individual was caught trying to vaccinate people for COVID-19 and he was chased away, finding refuge at the neighborhood leader\u2019s (Chef de Quartier, in French) house.\u201d", "Ka said that in the beginning of the French version, \u201cyou can clearly overhear the Wolof narrator, but he gets quickly overtaken by the French-speaking narrator.\u201d The French version, he said, \u201cdefinitely is not a translation of the Wolof version\u201d \u2014 he said it adds more dramatic details, \u201ctalking about seven kids killed and the need in return to kill the individual.\u201d", "Multiple government agencies told AFP Senegal that one Senegalese man (not two people) was briefly arrested on March 26 in Dalifort, an area in the country\u2019s capital of Dakar, and that he was selling cosmetics and hadn\u2019t actually tried to vaccinate anyone. An armed forces ministry spokesman said the mishap occurred because the man was wearing a health ministry T-shirt and jokingly said he had vaccines, causing a stir. Police found that he only had cosmetic products.", "One website in Ghana, ezone57.com, ran the video under the headline: \u201cCoronavirus: COVID-19 Vaccine Killed 7 Children in Senegal(West Africa) [VIDEO].\u201d That post garnered considerable attention, and its headline appeared in screenshots on Facebook, before the website took down the story and published another debunking the claim.", "The falsehood circulated amid news reports about controversial remarks made by two French doctors who suggested vaccine trials should be conducted in Africa.", "World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus referred to those comments as \u201cracist,\u201d saying during an April 6 press conference that \u201cAfrica cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.\u201d", "\u201cWe will follow all the rules to test any vaccines or therapeutics all over the world using exactly the same rule,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in Europe, Africa or wherever \u2014 we will use the same protocol.\u201d", "\u201cThe hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop,\u201d he said.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
