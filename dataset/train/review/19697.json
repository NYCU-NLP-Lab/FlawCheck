["About this rating", "Invasive and exotic animals have long been common subjects of scarelore, and messages alerting readers to the supposed threat posed by some new or previously unheard-of species often spread like wildfire across message boards, social networks and email inboxes.", "These posts typically take the form of a \"public service announcement\" and are shared in good faith, and without hesitation, by people who sincerely wish to alert their friends and loved ones to an unfamiliar threat. For these reasons, the \"dangerous animal alert\" is also a frequent source of misinformation, deliberate scare-mongering, or even downright trolling.", "On 21 August 2018, one Facebook post went viral after it warned of a \"new deadly spider\" breed which was purportedly spreading across the United States and had killed five people in one week.", "Presenting several close-up photographs of a scary-looking spider, the post proclaimed:\nNEW DEADLY SPIDER SPREADS ACROSS USA\nTHE SPIDER FROM HELL.
