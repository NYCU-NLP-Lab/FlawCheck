It means that state taxes come more from the poor and middle class than from the rich.", "\"Virtually every state\u2019s tax system is fundamentally unfair, taking a much greater share of income from middle- and low-income families than from wealthy families,\" the report says. \"The absence of a graduated personal income tax and the over reliance on consumption taxes exacerbate this problem in many states.\"", "The report measures property, sales and excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes paid by different income groups in each state in 2013 and concludes Florida is \"No. 2 of the terrible 10\" -- the second most-regressive tax system in the country. (No. 1 was Washington state.)", "\"The No. 1 and No. 2 predictor of a very unfair tax system is not having a personal income tax of any kind and an above-average sales tax, and Florida has both of those things,\" said Matt Gardner, the institute\u2019s executive director.", "The report found that for non-elderly taxpayers, the bottom 20 percent pay 13.2 percent of their income toward state and local taxes.
