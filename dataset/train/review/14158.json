["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on December 5, 2018", "An old, bogus quote claiming that Hillary Clinton suggested in 2013 that Donald Trump should run for public office is circulating again on Facebook. It\u2019s still not true.", "Even after it has been thoroughly debunked, misinformation can keep spreading.", "For example, a claim from a made-up story that was popular shortly before the 2016 presidential election has morphed into a meme that has been recently circulating on social media, even though it has been exposed as misinformation by major news outlets.", "The meme claims that Hillary Clinton said in 2013: \u201cI would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; they\u2019re honest and can\u2019t be bought.\u201d", "Clinton did not say that.\u00a0The claim that she did was first made in October 2016 on a now defunct website called therightists.com, which was registered to an owner in Israel. The site\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page said, \u201cThis is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!\u201d", "Clinton\u2019s purported praise of Trump would fall into the \u201csatire\u201d category, since the quote attributed to her is fabricated.", "The \u201chybrid\u201d website claimed Clinton made\u00a0her flattering remarks about Trump\u00a0at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs on Oct. 29, 2013. Clinton did speak at that conference;\u00a0WikiLeaks\u00a0posted\u00a0the\u00a0transcript of her speech.\u00a0But the quote attributed to her is not in the transcript.", "The made-up quote from therightists.com\u2019s story that has been turned into a meme appears to be loosely based on Clinton\u2019s answer to a question she was asked at the event:", "Male attendee at Goldman Sachs\u2019 Builders and Innovators Summit, Oct. 29, 2013:\u00a0My question is, as entrepreneurs, we risk a lot.\u00a0 And Mike Bloomberg had 30 billion other reasons than to take office.\u00a0 Do we need a wholesale change in Washington that has more to do with people that don\u2019t need the job than have the job?", "Clinton: That\u2019s a really interesting question.\u00a0 You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office.\u00a0 I really would like to see that because I do think, you know, you don\u2019t have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom.\u00a0 And there\u2019s that memorable phrase from a former member of the Senate:\u00a0 You can be maybe rented but never bought.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s important to have people with those experiences.", "And especially now, because many of you in this room are on the cutting edge of technology or health care or some other segment of the economy, so you are people who look over the horizon.\u00a0 And coming into public life and bringing that perspective as well as the success and the insulation that success gives you could really help in a lot of our political situations right now.", "The part about not being able to be \u201cbought\u201d was likely a reference to John Breaux, a former congressman who once\u00a0said his vote could not be bought, but \u201cit can be rented.\u201d That quote has been changed a little over the years and widely used since Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said it in 1981 after changing his vote to support Reagan-era budget cuts after sugar subsidies were included. Breaux later became a senator.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "\u201cHillary Clinton In 2013: \u2018I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They\u2019re Honest And Can\u2019t Be Bought.\u2019\u201d Therightists.com. 17 Oct 2016.", "WikiLeaks. \u201cGoldman Sachs paid speeches\u201d email.
