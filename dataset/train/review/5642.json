["About this rating", "In late August 2018, a number of English-language websites rehashed a story about a young Chinese couple who had reportedly struggled with infertility issues for years, until they visited a doctor who informed them that they could not become pregnant through anal sex alone.", "The woman\u2019s symptoms led Doctor Liu to believe that she may have had some sort of gynaecological disease.", "But following an examination, the wife was revealed to be a virgin.", "Doctor Liu then inspected the woman\u2019s anus and discovered that she \u2018could fit three fingers\u2019 inside.", "It was then that the medic is said to have learned the couple had been mistakenly having anal sex for four years, resulting in their failure to conceive.", "Doctor Liu reportedly handed the couple each a sex-ed handbook and also gave them \u2018guidelines\u2019 before they were sent home.", "The advice appeared to work, as news of the wife\u2019s pregnancy arrived just a few months later.", "The doctor said: \u2018Four years of marriage and neither the husband nor wife knew how to get pregnant. Couples so lacking in general knowledge are very rare.\u2019", "Multiple news outlets, including the Daily Mail, the Sun, Metro, and Newsweek all aggregated their own versions of this story, all citing a single report from the Guiyang Evening News as the source of their information:", "Our search to verify this information raised a number of red flags which indicated that the story may have been a humorous (or denigrating) anecdote about the importance of sex education and awareness rather than an account of a genuine medical incident.", "The Guiyang Evening News is a real Chinese newspaper, but we were unable to locate this story on their website or their Weibo (a Chinese social media site similar to Facebook) page. Our search for information about obstetrician Liu Hongmei (\u5218\u7ea2\u6885) turned up a number of pages on the Guiyang Evening News website, none of which dealt with the possibility (or lack thereof) of getting pregnant via anal sex.", "We did find an article attributed to the Guiyang Evening News on the new.qq.com. website which appears to be the source used in the aforementioned English-language articles. However, we are skeptical about the authenticity of that source.", "The web site QQ.com features a news client that appears to pull stories from various sources in order to serve the community of WeChat, a multi-purpose messaging and social media app that was developed by Tencent. As we could not find this story on the official web site of the Guiyang Evening News, it's possible this story was erroneously credited to them on QQ.com, or that they deleted the original article after it was pulled by the QQ.com news client.", "Either way, many readers of the original Chinese article were skeptical that the story relayed a true event.

This story is intended to degrade rural people. Although some young people today come from rural areas, they are not ignorant to this degree. We all know that when men and women engage in physical contact with each other, they will experience a physiological reaction. The second part of the reaction is naturally to use the appropriate body parts. They figure out how to make it work on their own.
