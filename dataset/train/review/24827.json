Sen. Ted Cruz said that.", "Trump claimed that Sanders \u201clied\u201d in saying that Trump \u201cwants the minimum wage to go below $7.\u201d But Sanders got his facts right.

But I think that states \u2026 I think that states should really call the shots.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0But it has to go up. Now, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one?", "Trump went on to say,\u00a0\u201cIn fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.\u201d We at FactCheck.org did not criticize Sanders on this point. In fact, Trump did say he was in favor of having no federal minimum wage. He was asked by NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 8, \u201cshould the federal government set a floor?\u201d And he responded: \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.\u201d", "Here\u2019s Sanders Monday night at the Democratic National Convention:", "Sanders, July 25:\u00a0He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, a starvation wage.\u00a0While Trump believes in huge tax breaks, huge tax breaks for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.", "It may be difficult to follow Trump\u2019s shifting position on the minimum wage: As Todd noted in that NBC News interview, Trump said in one of the debates that he was against raising it \u2014 \u201cI hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,\u201d he said in November \u2014 and then months\u00a0later said he would be \u201copen\u201d to raising it.", "He even told Todd in May that he \u201cwould like to see an increase of some magnitude,\u201d but\u00a0added that\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d rather leave it to the states.\u201d However, there is no doubt that he said in that interview that the federal government should not set a floor, leaving states, as Sanders said, \u201cthe right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the full exchange from that May 8 NBC News interview:", "NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd:\u00a0Minimum wage. Minimum wage. At a debate, you know. You remember what you said. You thought you didn\u2019t want to touch it. Now you\u2019re open to it. What changed?", "Trump:\u00a0Let me just tell you, I\u2019ve been traveling the country for many months. Since June 16th. I\u2019m all over. Today I\u2019m in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear, is packed with thousands and thousands of people. I\u2019m doing that right after I finish you.", "I have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other. So you may have a governor \u2014", "Todd:\u00a0Right. You want the fed\u2013 but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states\u2013", "Trump:\u00a0No, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what\u2019s happened to the economy, with what\u2019s happened to the cost. I mean, it\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour.

He said one nice thing about me. He said I\u2019m a genius.", "Trump\u00a0frequently claims that Putin called him a genius, but as we wrote on June 17, that relies on a faulty translation of the Russian president\u2019s faint praise for Trump during a press scrum in December, after Putin was asked what he thought about the Republican candidate.", "According to a translation by Russia Insider, which uploaded the video, Putin responded, \u201cHe\u2019s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt. But it\u2019s not our affair to determine his worthiness \u2014 that\u2019s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race. He wants to move to a different level of relations, to more solid, deeper relations with Russia. And how can Russia not welcome that \u2014 we welcome that. As for his internal political issues and the turn of speech which he uses to raise his popularity, I repeat, it\u2019s not our affair to evaluate them.\u201d", "It\u2019s the word \u201ccolorful\u201d in the first sentence of that translation that is at issue here.\u00a0We reached out to several Russian language experts, and there was some disagreement about the precise meaning of Putin\u2019s phrase, with some translating it as \u201ccolorful,\u201d others \u201cbold\u201d or \u201cbright.\u201d But they all agreed that Trump was inflating Putin\u2019s rather guarded praise, and that Putin most certainly did not go so far as to call Trump a \u201cgenius.\u201d", "In a speech in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 17, Putin set the record straight, explaining that he had only described Trump as \u201cflamboyant.\u201d According to Reuters, Putin added, with a smile, \u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he?

OK? He mentioned the N-word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the N-word. You know what the \u2018N\u2019 word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked. He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. Number one, he doesn\u2019t like him. And number two, he doesn\u2019t respect him. I think he\u2019s going to respect your president if I\u2019m elected.

It is the literal translation of Negro. When I was a\u00a0student in the USSR in the late 1980s I heard it many times, used by teachers and\u00a0students at my institute when talking about Africans and oppressed black Americans,\u00a0and it was written in textbooks. I have heard it used by Russians of Putin\u2019s\u00a0generation since, including a couple of Russian officials in conversations.\u00a0It does sound pretty similar to the \u201cN\u201d word to an English speaker, so it would\u00a0certainly be shocking out of context.\u201d", "We did come across an article posted by the Conservative Tribune, which carried the headline \u201cWhile Talking ISIS Strategy, Putin Just Dropped The \u201cN\u201d Word\u2026 This Could Change EVERYTHING.\u201d But as the article quickly makes clear, the N-word in question there was \u201cnuclear.\u201d", "Conservative Tribune: Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ruled out the possibility of deploying nuclear warheads when dealing with the Islamic State group, but he hoped it would never come that.", "But the context of Trump\u2019s comment makes clear that that\u2019s not the N-word to which Trump was referring.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b2a73b7d-2cd0-4236-8e9e-e7210ffb8d49", "Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails from the private server she used as secretary of state after she received a congressional subpoena requesting her emails.

After she gets a subpoena. She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem.", "Trump, of course, is referring to Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email system for government businesses.

At that press conference, she first disclosed that she deleted her personal emails.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t see any reason to keep them,\u201d she said.", "Trump is assuming that the emails were deleted after March 4, when Clinton was subpoenaed, and perhaps before March 10, when she held her press conference. But her campaign told us for a previous article that\u00a0the emails were deleted before March 4, although it did not provide us with a date.", "FBI Director Jim Comey at a July 5 press conference announced the results of the agency\u2019s investigation into whether Clinton or anyone on her staff violated federal law in the handling of classified information on a private server.

Any increase above 10 percent has to be submitted and approved by government regulators. A 60 percent jump could well be an outlier.
