["About this rating", "In another seeming attempt to discredit mass school shooting survivor Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, the outspoken teenaged gun control advocate, a widely shared meme fixated on a patch that was sewn on the shoulder of the jacket she wore during her speech at the March for Our Lives really in Washington, D.C., on 24 March 2018:", "Gonz\u00e1lez, who has been at the forefront of a new wave of gun safety activism spurred by the shooting attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left seventeen people dead on 14 February 2018, has not ever identified as a \"communist\" nor expressed an affinity for the regime of the Castro brothers. However, she has been open about her Cuban heritage, stating in an op-ed piece she penned for Harper's Bazaar magazine that:", "I'm 18 years old, Cuban and bisexual.

We just want the people to be more responsible. We want civilians to have to go through more rolls of red tape to get what they want, because if any of that tape can stop those who shouldn't own a gun from owning a gun, then our government will have done something right.\"", "Other memes have also falsely presented Gonz\u00e1lez as having ripped up a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Leslie Gibson, a Republican candidate for Maine's state House, derisively called her a \"skinhead lesbian\" before abandoning his candidacy amidst backlash over his remarks.", "The attacks against Gonz\u00e1lez fall in line with efforts by far-right blogs to paint another shooting survivor, David Hogg, as a pawn of the \"deep state.\"", "Gonz\u00e1lez, Emma. \u00a0 \"Parkland Student Emma Gonz\u00e1lez Opens Up About Her Fight for Gun Control.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Harper's Bazaar. \u00a0 26 February 2018.", "Univisi\u00f3n. \u00a0 \"Emma Gonzalez: La S\u00fabita Nueva Estrella del Movimiento Antiarmas Es una Adolescente de 18 A\u00f1os de Origen Cubano.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 17 February 2018.", "Arturo Garcia is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
