Such is the case for rapper-producer Kanye West, who just happens to have metro Atlanta connections.", "West is one of the most recognizable and best-selling musicians around. But he has also had his share of \u00a0run-ins with the top rungs of the political class, including Republican and Democratic presidents.", "He evoked the ire of President George W.

The president slammed West again in a follow-up interview. Just a couple of weeks ago, Obama criticized the over-the-top lifestyle of West and the entertainer\u2019s unmarried mother of his child, Kim Kardashian.

During that interview while discussing his Grammy wins, West said, \"I don\u2019t know if this is statistically right, but I\u2019m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven\u2019t won one against a white person.\"", "He continued: \"But the thing is, I don\u2019t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate.\"", "West\u2019s claims about having the most golden gramophones piqued our interest, so we decided to run them through the AJC Truth-O-Meter.", "West is a hometown boy.

His parents met and married in Atlanta, according to a \u00a0book by West\u2019s mother. His father, Ray West, was one of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s earliest black photographers.
