Several media outlets published the image as a still from Kalam\u2019s childhood. An article published by India Today on May 8, 2016, had captioned the photograph as, \u201cAshiamma Jainulabiddin, mother of APJ Abdul Kalam\u201d.", "We also found that the image was cropped out of a bigger family photograph.

This claim was earlier fact-checked by BBC Hindi who arrived at the conclusion that the photograph was APJ Abdul Kalam\u2019s childhood photograph.", "We found that one of the earliest instances, when the image had appeared on the Internet, was a blog post published in August 2013.

He said, \u201cThat is not Dr Kalam and his mother. That\u2019s a fake photograph. We don\u2019t have any photographs of Dr Kalam\u2019s childhood so far. Those days, Dr Kalam\u2019s mother would not take any photograph. So, it\u2019s not possible. There are also no photographs of Kalam\u2019s father.\u201d", "We were told that the youngest picture of APJ Abdul Kalam available with the \u2018House of Kalam\u2019 is from his college days.", "Moreover, Alt News was also told that there are no photographs of Kalam\u2019s father. However, we were able to access a painting of Kalam\u2019s father, which is available at the \u2018House of Kalam\u2019, the former president\u2019s ancestral house in Rameshwaram, where his 102-year-old elder brother A.P.J.
