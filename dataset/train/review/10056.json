["About this rating", "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate, have been scrupulously careful in how they expose their children -- George and Charlotte -- to the glare of publicity, since the birth of their son in 2013.", "So it would come as a great surprise to learn that Prince George had appeared in a viral Facebook video, reeling off biblical verses in the form of the alphabet.", "In an American accent.", "Nonetheless, in February 2018, Facebook user Helene K H Yap posted a video of such a boy, and speculated about his identity: \"Prince George, Prince William's son? The grandson of Princess Diana?\"", "The post was shared more than 400,000 times within six days. However, the video does not show Prince George of Cambridge, third in line to the British crown. It shows four-year-old Tanner Hemness, from Tyler in East Texas.", "The video was originally posted to Facebook in October 2016 by Tanner's father, Taylor Hemness, who was then a TV news anchor at KLTV, an ABC affiliate in Tyler, Texas. Hemness wrote:", "I am so very proud of this kid. We've been working on this all summer, one letter a week, and every time I thought a verse was too long or complicated, he'd prove me wrong. Now the hard part...being the kind of Dad who helps him live these words.", "The original video garnered almost 7 million views, and a further 32 million views when it was re-posted by Hemness's then-employer, KLTV.", "The viral explosion of the video saw Taylor and Tanner appearing on the widely-syndicated Steve Harvey talk show:", "In an interview with the Bible Gateway blog, Taylor Hemness provided more details about the background to the video:", "Last spring, our youth minister at Glenwood Church of Christ in Tyler, Texas, challenged families to learn a Bible verse for every letter of the alphabet. At the time, Tanner was 3-and-a-half, so I started to tune out. But the minister encouraged parents of young children to try it too, because \u201cwe\u2019d be amazed by what they\u2019re able to retain.\u201d", "I thought it was worth a try, but honestly didn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d be able to do it. That thought was only strengthened when I saw the list of verses the church provided to us. \u201cJesus wept\u201d isn\u2019t on the list! I wasn\u2019t even sure they were all from the same translation. So, that Monday, we wrote the first verse on a chalkboard in our kitchen, and started practicing with him. I\u2019d run through it every day, and by Thursday, he had it.", "The following Monday, we did it again with \u201cB,\u201d but we also still made him recite A. So, by week five, he was doing A, B, C, D, and E every day. There were a few verses that took two weeks, thanks to difficulty, or things like family travel. Altogether, it took about six months.", "He\u2019s wearing a tuxedo in the video because we were at a wedding. He was a ring bearer in a co-worker\u2019s wedding, he was all dressed up, and he\u2019d just learned \u201cZ\u201d the week prior. We had a few minutes, and a quiet room, so I took the opportunity to film him, which I\u2019d always planned to do when he was done.", "Setting aside the true origins of the viral video, a couple of points should have raised flags for anyone contemplating the possibility that it features Prince George.", "Firstly, although we don't have audio evidence of the young English prince's voice, it would be astonishing if he spoke with a Texan drawl. Secondly, Prince George has blond hair, not brown.", "(Official White House photo by Pete Souza)", "Press Association.\u00a0 \"Duchess of Cambridge Has Privacy Breach Complaints Upheld.\"\r\n\u00a0 The Guardian.\u00a0 15 September 2016.", "Petersen, Jonathan.\u00a0 \"4-Year-Old Recites ABCs Using Bible Verses.\"\r\n\u00a0 Bible Gateway.\u00a0 23 January 2017.", "Dan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
