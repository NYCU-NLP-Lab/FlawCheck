The post includes what looks like a still of a TV segment with photos of Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for Florida governor, and Ron DeSantis, his Republican opponent. The figures \"49.4%\" and \"3,343,634\" appear near Gillum\u2019s picture, and \"48.8%\" and \"3,297,970\" next to DeSantis\u2019s. In the top right corner is a graphic that reads: \"Close Call: 99% In.\"", "\"This was shown on MSNBC last night, calling the race for Gillum. Look at the upper right corner-\u201999% in\u2019 referring to Florida voting,\" the post says. It then quotes a Huffington Post story without attribution. \"Oops,\" the story stars. \"MSNBC on Monday inadvertently aired what looked like live results of the heated gubernatorial election in Florida \u2014 a day before the actual voting.\"", "This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Obviously, we do not yet have any vote totals here the night before the election. That was a misfire. Don\u2019t worry, I was pretty confused when I saw it up there.\"", "Florida results are not yet available, said Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, and preliminary unofficial election results won\u2019t be posted to the Florida Election Watch website until 8 p.m. Eastern Time.", "\"Florida\u2019s elections are not rigged,\" Revell said in an email. \"No election fraud complaints have been filed with our office today.
