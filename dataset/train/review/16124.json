["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 16, 2018", "Q: Did the FBI issue a report that \u201cconfirms\u201d that \u201cnone\u201d of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers\u2019 stories were true?", "A: No. Contrary to false social media claims, the bureau did not reach any conclusion in its background investigation.", "As accusations of sexual misconduct surfaced against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid his contentious Senate confirmation proceedings, the Department of Justice reminded that the FBI\u2019s role in conducting background investigations for such nominees was to provide information to lawmakers \u2014 not to reach conclusions about allegations.", "\u201cThe FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation,\u201d the DOJ said in a September statement. \u201cThe purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States. The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI\u2019s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers.\u201d", "Despite that, viral posts on social media have alleged that an \u201cFBI report confirms none of the Kavanaugh accusations were true. None of them.\u201d", "That\u2019s false.", "The FBI conducted a supplemental background investigation to review allegations against Kavanaugh made by two women: Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 the California professor who publicly testified that a drunk, teenage Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in the 1980s \u2014 and Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale with Kavanaugh and claimed\u00a0that he exposed himself to her.", "The supplemental investigation, which lasted several days, included interviewing 10 individuals about those allegations, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bureau provided its report documenting the interviews to the White House, which then provided it to the Senate. The Judiciary Committee\u00a0said the supplemental investigation showed there was \u201cno corroboration of the allegations made by Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez.\u201d", "In other words, the FBI\u2019s interviews did not substantiate the accusations by Ford or Ramirez \u2014 but they also did not show the accounts to be false.", "The FBI investigation did not probe other allegations, including the accusations put forth by Julie Swetnick and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti.", "Weeks after Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u00a0Republican\u00a0Sen. Chuck Grassley,\u00a0referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the FBI for investigation for allegedly making \u201cmaterially false statements\u201d to the committee.", "Grassley later made a similar\u00a0referral\u00a0to the FBI to investigate another woman,\u00a0Judy Munro-Leighton. Grassley said in his referral letter that Munro-Leighton contacted the committee and claimed to be the \u201cJane Doe\u201d who had submitted an earlier, anonymous written accusation against Kavanaugh. Munro-Leighton, as we\u2019ve previously reported, admitted she in fact was not the woman who wrote that letter and had not even met Kavanaugh.", "Those referrals relate only to Swetnick and Munro-Leighton, not to Ford or Ramirez.", "On Nov. 2, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a lengthy\u00a0report\u00a0examining all of the accusations. It said that committee investigators \u201cfound no witness who could provide any verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations brought against Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "Keith, Tamara. \u201cDemocrats Want FBI To Investigate Kavanaugh Allegations. It Likely Won\u2019t.\u201d NPR. 18 Sep 2018.", "Letter from Sen. Charles Grassley, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray. 2 Nov 2018.", "Letter from Sen. Charles Grassley, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray. 25 Oct 2018.", "\u201cSupplemental FBI Investigation Executive Summary.\u201d U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. 4 Oct 2018.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
