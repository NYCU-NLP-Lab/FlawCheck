Nathan Deal has spent much of his first term promoting Georgia as the premier state to start a business or to expand.\n\nIn his speech, the governor claimed his efforts are working.\n\n\"Since I stood before you last year at this address, we have announced more than 10,000 jobs, and many of these are on the high end of the employment scale,\" Deal said. \"More and more businesses are deciding to make Georgia their home.\"\n\nA Deal spokesman did not respond to a request for specifics to back up this claim. We began our research by reading each news release on Deal\u2019s website since his 2012 State of the State address. More than two dozen of the releases include announcements of new jobs that would be created in Georgia. By our count, the total was slightly more than 9,000. The releases do not say whether all the positions are full-time jobs.\n\nWe interpreted Deal\u2019s comments that many of the jobs were \"on the high end of the employment scale\" to mean that they will command high salaries.\n\nThere is some support for the governor\u2019s claim on that point:", "The governor\u2019s numbers were slightly off on the number of jobs, from what we found. It seems reasonable to believe that many of these positions will be on the high end of the employment scale.
