["A video is being circulated on WhatsApp. It shows a young woman with a face veil, who weeps as she supposedly narrates in Hindi, the plight of Muslims in Baruasagar town of Jhansi district, UP.", "The audio is as follows:", "\u201cAssalam Waleikum, I am speaking from Baruasagar in Jhansi district. For the last three days, violence has flared up in Baruasagar between Hindus and Muslims. Muslims are being beaten up, my brother was brutally thrashed, our women are being harassed. Please send this message to our Muslim brothers so that we can receive help. Police is supporting Hindus. Hindus enter our homes every night and beat us up and harass us. Please help us.

The YouTube video itself is titled, \u2018I am Ayesha from Kashmir speaking, bursts into tears- Google translation), and the hashtags #Kashmir_news and #Kashmir_Muslim_2019 are used. In the \u2018video report\u2019 which begins at 46 seconds, the voice over in Bengali says,", "\u201cKashmiri daughter is saying this. There is violence in our area the last three days. We are being killed for being Muslims. The daughter further said that the area\u2019s girls are being harassed. We can\u2019t tell Hindus anything. They beat us every day. They harass us everyday. Please help us. Send it to all Muslims so that they help us. You heard the daughter. How would you feel if your family is tortured in front of your eyes? What will we answer to Allah if we are helpless against the atrocities faced by our Muslim brothers? Are you wondering how you can help? Widely share this video.
