["About this rating", "On 28 November 2016, New Yorker humor columnist Andy Borowitz published an article suggesting that President-elect Donald Trump had decided to name Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n to head the Drug Enforcement Administration:", "In an official statement, Trump said that El Chapo\u2019s \u201ctremendous success in the private sector\u201d showed that he has what it takes to \u201cshake things up\u201d at the D.E.A.", "Trump\u2019s appointment of the former drug lord surprised many in Washington, in no small part because acrimony between the two allegedly prompted El Chapo, in 2015, to put a hundred-million-dollar bounty on Trump\u2019s head.", "The piece alluded to a 2015 rumor that turned out to be a hoax. While Borowitz's satirical work doesn't typically get mistaken for actual news, the story was not the first effort by the popular Borowitz Report to be mistaken for real news on Facebook and Twitter.", "Previous articles that confused users included claims George W. Bush described Bob Denver as a role model, Fox News announced it would \"shut down for routine maintenance\" on 21 January 2013 (the date President Barack Obama was inaugurated for his second term), Chris Christie refused to retrieve Donald Trump's dry cleaning after Mike Pence was named as the candidate's running mate, and that President Obama signed an executive order mandating that the loser in the 2016 presidential election leave the United States forever.", "Although the majority of \"satirical\" web sites wish to trick social media users into sharing fake (and often influential) content, Borowitz is one of a few genuine satirists whose material makes light of political and current events. His New Yorker bio states:", "Andy Borowitz is a New York Times best-selling author and a comedian who has written for The New Yorker since 1998. In 2001, he created the Borowitz Report, a satirical news column that has millions of readers around the world, for which he won the first-ever National Press Club award for humor. The Borowitz Report was acquired by The New Yorker in 2012.", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
