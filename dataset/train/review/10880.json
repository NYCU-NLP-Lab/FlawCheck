["While health workers were on strike across Kenya, Stanley Kiptis gave several reasons why counties cannot pay more. But not all of his claims withstood scrutiny.", "In December 2020 healthcare workers in Kenya went on strike over issues such as pay and lack of personal protective equipment. The impasse between the workers and their county governor employers continues, crippling the country\u2019s public health sector.", "Doctors returned to work in late December, but by early February clinical officers and nurses were still on strike.", "The strikes \u201caffect how we work\u201d, Dr Chibanzi Mwachonda, secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, told Africa Check.", "Governors insist they don\u2019t have enough money to meet the workers\u2019 pay demands.", "As the stand-off raged in January, Baringo County governor Stanley Kiptis claimed that more than half of the county's budget went to health, the highest allocation in the country. He also claimed the county had exceeded constitutional salary limits.", "\"In Baringo, we put 51% of our resources into healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's the highest. Baringo and some other counties have gone beyond the 35% ceiling as set in the constitution. We are at 55.7%, so we cannot be in a position of, really, meeting those demands.\u201d", "But do the governor\u2019s numbers add up? We looked.", "In Baringo, we put 51% of our resources into healthcare", "The governor\u2019s spokesperson told Africa Check he would confirm the source of this figure. We will update this report with the county\u2019s response.", "John Kinuthia from the public finance and budgeting think tank International Budget Partnership-Kenya recommended that we examine allocations to county health departments to check health spending.", "All county budgets are submitted to the office of the controller of budget, a state agency that monitors how they are used. Its most recent report, for the 2020/21 financial year, shows that Baringo allocated KSh2.35 billion of a total KSh6.3 billion budget to its health services department.", "This works out to 37%. Baringo has not allocated more than this to health in the last three years. We rate the governor\u2019s claim as incorrect.", "Baringo\u2019s healthcare allocation is the highest", "Kenya has 47 counties. Kinuthia told us there wasn\u2019t any \u201cguidance concerning what constitutes a health ministry or department in a county\u201d.", "For example, a \u201cdepartment of health and sanitation\u201d could later change to a \u201cdepartment of health\u201d and a separate \u201cdepartment of sanitation and water\u201d.", "In November 2020, when the agency filed its most recent report, 40 counties had allocated their health budgets to a single department, and four had allocated funding to more than one. Three were yet to submit their budgets to the controller.", "We compiled the data into a table and calculated the share spent on health ministries.", "At least three counties allocated more to health than Baringo: Muranga, Nyeri and Embu. Baringo\u2019s 37.2% health allocation is among the highest in Kenya, but it is not the highest. We rate the governor\u2019s claim as incorrect.", "Baringo [has] gone beyond the 35% ceiling on personnel emoluments as set in the constitution. We are at 55.7%.", "Kenya\u2019s public finance regulations require counties to cap spending on their employees\u2019 wages and benefits at 35% of total revenue.", "The controller of budget reports that in 2020 Baringo County allocated KSh3.45 billion for \u201ccompensation to employees\u201d. The county\u2019s total expected revenue to finance its budget is KSh6.3 billion.", "\u201cPersonnel emoluments\u201d \u2013 the cost of employee salaries and other benefits \u2013 take up 54.7% of the budget.", "We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct.", "For a better understanding of healthcare spending trends in Kenya\u2019s 47 counties, Dr Rahab Mbau, a health economist at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, referred Africa Check to a national health ministry analysis.", "This covers spending in the three financial years to 2018/19 and shows that all counties allocated 79% to 82% to recurrent expenditure. Most of these funds were spent on staff costs such as salaries, wages and allowances.", "This skew towards staff costs \u201cdoesn't make sense\u201d, Dr Chris Masila, founder of Nairobi-based health consultancy Practhealth, told Africa Check.", "How much a county spends on health depends on total revenue \u2013 and the governor\u2019s vision, Masila said. One year\u2019s figures may not be enough to fully understand health spending, he said, as some objectives take longer.", "John Kinuthia from the public finance and budgeting think tank International Budget Partnership-Kenya agreed. \u201cPriorities always go up and down. Just because a county is spending 20% on health does not make it bad. It might be that they have done a lot of health over the last couple of years.\u201d", "Photo:\u00a0Patrick Meinhardt / AFP", "Please complete this form to receive the HTML sharing code.", "We examine three claims in a Cape Talk interview with the National Sea Rescue Institute on world drowning prevention day.", "Covid has trained a spotlight on causes of death and how deaths are recorded across the world.
