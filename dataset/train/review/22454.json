Jason Isaac said the gambit had a cost. \"Back to work tomorrow. Per diem alone costs taxpayers $27,300/day,\" the Dripping Springs Republican tweeted May 30.", "Nearly $30,000 a day?", "As legislators started the 30-day special session immediately called by Gov. Rick Perry, Ellen Troxclair, Isaac\u2019s chief of staff, told us Isaac based his figure on information from the Texas Ethics Commission.", "Some background: A provision in the Texas Constitution provides for each legislator and the lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, to receive a $600 monthly salary, mileage reimbursements and the per diem, which is a stipend intended to ease lawmaker living expenses while they\u2019re in Austin on state business each day during regular and special sessions. The commission, established in 1991, sets the per diem and also may recommend raises for legislators to voters, though that\u2019s not happened.", "According to information on the commission\u2019s website, the current legislative per diem is $150.", "So, counting the 150 Texas House members, 31 senators and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, 182 lawmakers qualify for the payment each day lawmakers are in session.

A 1930 constitutional amendment changed the per diem to $10 for the first 120 days of the session and $5 after. During special sessions, the per diem was $10. A 1954 amendment raised the per diem to no more than $25 for the first 120 days of the regular session, while a 1960 amendment greenlighted paying legislators an annual salary of up to $4,800 plus a $12 per diem during the first 120 days of each regular session and each day of the special session.", "Per diem amounts inched up in later years with the commission setting the rate at $168 in January 2009, according to a Nov. 12 2010, news story in the Austin American-Statesman. But after the commission proposed authorizing the same rate members of the 2011 Legislature, Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus called for the rate to be lowered to $150 in a Nov. 29, 2010 letter stating the move would help the state tighten overall spending.", "Do lawmakers ever pass up the per diem?", "Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, told us that no senators have declined the payments since 2003 when Senate Democrats fled to New Mexico to impede the passage of redistricting legislation.", "Steven Adrian, executive director of the House Business Office, told us no representatives have submitted a request to withhold or reduce per diem payments this session.", "Isaac\u2019s statement adds up to True.", "Twitter, Jason Isaac\u2019s tweet, May 30, 2011\n\nTexas Ethics Commission, Chapter 50.
