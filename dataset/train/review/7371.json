This cover, though, had a very different message: \"Mr. President... STOP THE INSANITY. You have lost the election \u2014 here's how to save your legacy.\"", "PoliAlert\u00a0and Breaking 911 have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.", "Fact check:No, Joe Biden's brother-in-law does not own Dominion Voting Systems", "Both the cover and staff editorial that are critical of Trump are real, published by\u00a0the New York Post on Dec. 27.", "The tabloid, owned by Rupert Murdoch, published the\u00a0front page online along with a copy of the\u00a0editorial, which\u00a0ran under the headline, \"The Post says: Give it up, Mr. President \u2014 for your sake and the nation\u2019s.\"", "The scathing editorial instructed Trump to \"end this dark charade\"\u00a0and accused him of \"cheering for an undemocratic coup\" by encouraging Republicans to reject the results of the presidential contest.", "\"You had every right to investigate the election. But let\u2019s be clear: Those efforts have found nothing,\" the editorial read.", "It also took aim at his allies, including lawyer Sidney Powell, whom\u00a0it called \"a crazy person,\"\u00a0and Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general\u00a0\u2013 who\u00a0it said committed acts \"tantamount to treason\" by suggesting Trump should institute martial law rather than accept the electoral results and leave office peacefully.", "Instead of disputing his loss, the editorial encouraged Trump to focus on the upcoming runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5\u00a0that will decide control of the Senate.", "\"Securing the Senate means\u00a0securing your legacy. You should use your considerable charm and influence to support the Georgia candidates, mobilizing your voters for them,\" the editorial read. \"Focus on their success, not your own grievances, as we head into the final week.\"", "Fact check:Rev. Warnock sermon on 'whiteness' condemns racism, does not call for anti-white bigotry", "The editorial concluded with the following\u00a0warning for Trump,\u00a0a quote that\u00a0PoliAlert also included in its\u00a0post on Instagram:", "\"If you insist on spending your final days in office threatening to burn it all down, that will be how you are remembered.\u00a0Not as a revolutionary, but as the anarchist holding the match.\"", "The New\u00a0York Post has long bolstered\u00a0Trump\u00a0\u2014 both while\u00a0he became a celebrity in New York City and early in the primaries in 2016, per\u00a0the New York Times.", "Still, its tone has shifted since it became clear that\u00a0President-elect\u00a0Joe Biden had clinched a victory.
