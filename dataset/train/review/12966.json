["About this rating", "Dr. Joseph Goebbels was the head of the Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in Germany under the Nazi government of Adolf Hitler from 1933-45, a figure who \"never wavered from his carefully crafted message of German superiority and rabid anti-Semitism.\"", "During the presidency of Donald Trump, a statement attributed to Goebbels was circulated via a quote meme, a statement claiming that propaganda proved ineffective on \"intellectuals\" and was therefore best crafted to appeal (not necessarily truthfully) to the emotions of the \"man in the street\":", "There was no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. For intellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield to the stronger, and this will always be \"the man in the street.\"", "Arguments must therefore be crude, clear, and forcible, and appeal to emotions and instincts, not the intellect.

It is a reasonable summary of Goebbels\u2019s views -- but he never would have put it in that way.
