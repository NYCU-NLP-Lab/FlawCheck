Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., provided assistance to the insurrectionists.", "One Facebook user posted\u00a0on Jan. 13 a photo of Boebert and about dozen other people, at least four of whom appear to be making a white supremacist hand gesture.", "\"Congresswoman Lauren Boebert took this group on a guided tour of the Capitol one day before the insurrection. Three of the people participated and knew exactly where to go,\" reads the text below the photo, a tweet from the account of Frank Giugliano.
