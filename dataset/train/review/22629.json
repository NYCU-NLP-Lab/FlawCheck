["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on October 19, 2020", "Social media posts are once again making false and baseless claims about high-profile Democrats being involved in child trafficking and sex crimes.", "It\u2019s hard not to overstate this simple fact: There is not and has never been any evidence that the \u201cClintons, the Obamas & the Biden family are all involved in child trafficking & crimes against children.\u201d", "But that\u2019s what a Facebook post falsely claims \u2014 one of many posts that revive the long-debunked pizzagate conspiracy theory, which spread the fiction that prominent Democrats, including Hillary and Bill Clinton, were running a child sex-trafficking ring in the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.", "Although it was a hoax, many apparently believed in pizzagate \u2014 including Edgar Maddison Welch, who got four years in prison after going to the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria on Dec. 4, 2016, armed with a loaded AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver, firing the assault rifle into a door and scattering customers. \u201cWelch was motivated, at least in part, by unfounded rumors concerning a child sex-trafficking ring that supposedly was being perpetrated at the establishment,\u201d the Department of Justice said in a June 2017 press release announcing his sentence.", "Now, there are new unfounded rumors circulating on social media about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.", "\u201cIn 2016, we learned Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop contained proof Hillary Clinton & her associates are involved in child trafficking & pedophilia,\u201d one Facebook post says. \u201cNow we learn Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop had pedophile tapes. Our intelligence insider friend asks if we see a pattern. The Clintons, the Obamas & the Biden family are all involved in child trafficking & crimes against children, period.\u201d", "Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind InfoWars and the bogus notion that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was a hoax, posted a video Oct. 17 that carried the headline \u201cConfirmed: Trump Has Footage Of Hunter Biden Raping And Torturing Little Girls \u2014 Set To Release.\u201d The video quotes Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, claiming to have pictures of Hunter Biden \u201cthat I can\u2019t describe, some of which are illegal.\u201d The video has received more than 2.2 million views.", "Another Facebook post makes this graphic, baseless claim: \u201cHunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under 10 in China on his laptop!\u201d", "This kind of nonsense is circulating on social media like flotsam in the Hudson River from a New York garbage barge.", "How did we get here? It involves Giuliani, who has worked with a known Russian agent to obtain dirt on Joe Biden, and a conservative newspaper, the New York Post, which is owned by News Corp. and controlled by conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch.", "Let\u2019s recap what we know \u2014 so far.", "The hard drive of a laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden was obtained by the New York\u00a0Post from Robert Costello, a lawyer representing Giuliani. Last week, the paper published several stories based on emails from that hard drive \u2014 including one story that perpetuated the false narrative that Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor to protect a Ukrainian company that employed his son from an investigation. (In fact, Biden was carrying out the Obama administration\u2019s anti-corruption policy in Ukraine that was supported by the international community.)", "That New York Post story included an image of what the paper said was a subpoena for Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.", "A day after that story appeared, the conservative Western Journal carried a commentary piece saying that \u201ca barely visible signature bleeding through from back side\u201d of that subpoena \u201cappears to match that of FBI Special Agent Joshua Wilson.\u201d The website said Wilson works on child pornography cases.", "Three days later, Fox News host Maria Bartiromo asked Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin to \u201cconnect the dots,\u201d specifically asking if there is a \u201cchild pornography issue here on that laptop.\u201d (Fox News Channel is also controlled by Murdoch.)", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate,\u201d said Johnson, who nevertheless went on to say, \u201cI\u2019ve heard all kinds of things that I think will probably be revealed over the next few days.\u201d Johnson, chairman of the Senate homeland security committee, also has called on the FBI to confirm or deny the authenticity of the laptop.", "There are many unverified claims being made about the alleged contents of the laptop, but at this point we can say with certainty:", "Weiner, the ex-husband of Clinton\u2019s aide Huma Abedin, was sentenced in September 2017 to 21 months in prison for \u201ctransferring obscene material to a minor.\u201d The FBI examined his laptop as part of that investigation, and Abedin, who also used the laptop, did have work-related emails on it that she sent and received from Clinton.", "Clinton\u2019s emails on Weiner\u2019s laptop were thoroughly reviewed by the Department of Justice and the department\u2019s inspector general, and those reviews resulted in no criminal charges.", "Even though pizzagate and claims about Weiner\u2019s laptop have been debunked, specious reports about Clinton\u00a0continue to circulate on social media.", "These sorts of claims about Democrats often spring from QAnon, which the FBI has described as a conspiracy theory \u201cvery likely\u201d to \u201cmotivate some domestic extremists to commit criminal, sometimes violent activity.\u201d", "QAnon followers espouse a conspiracy theory that regards Trump as a crusader against what they consider elite pedophiles, including top Democrats and celebrities, who supposedly run the government and the entertainment industry.", "The president at a recent televised town hall declined to disavow QAnon, claiming he knows very little about it. Trump, however, has repeatedly\u00a0shared posts on Twitter from QAnon followers, and QAnon signage and paraphernalia have regularly\u00a0shown up\u00a0at Trump rallies.", "We don\u2019t know who is behind the latest unsubstantiated claims about Hunter Biden.
