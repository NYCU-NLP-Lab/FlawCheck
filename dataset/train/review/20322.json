["About this rating", "In December 2019, a video supposedly showing teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg shooting a gun started circulating on social media:", "This video racked up more than 1 million views within a few days of its initial posting. It was circulated both by people who found that it was out of character for Thunberg, a \"leftist\" who is fighting against climate change, and by those who found Thunberg doubly threatening when wielding a gun.", "This video, however, does not show the 16-year-old Swedish girl but rather a Twitter user named \"Emmy.\"", "Emmy (@eslinge) posted this video to her Twitter page on Dec. 7, 2019, a few days before anyone claimed that this footage featured Thunberg, along with the caption \"So anyway, I started blasting.\" Emmy then shared a second video of her shooting this weapon:", "Several people commented on Emmy's videos, saying that she looked like Thunberg. Emmy responded to one person, writing: \"F\u00f6rsta g\u00e5ngen jag fick h\u00f6ra det blev jag vansinnig men nu k\u00e4nns det n\u00e4stan lite charmigt att vara lik henne. :D\" translated as: \"The first time I heard it, I got crazy but now it feels almost a little charming to be like her. : D.\"", "Emmy told the AFP that she was about 15 years older than Thunberg. She also said that she hopes \"people don't really think that I am her. I don't want to cause Greta any harm, I think she's great.\"", "Emmy has also posted several articles from international news outlets that have also debunked this claim.", "In short, this video does not show environmental activist Greta Thunberg shooting a gun but a Twitter user named Emmy.", "Globo 1. \u00a0 \"\u00c9 #FAKE Que Jovem Com Metralhadora em V\u00eddeo Seja a Ativista Greta Thunberg.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "AFP Brasil. \u00a0 \"El Video de Una Mujer Disparando No Muestra a Greta Thunberg, Sino a Una Ingeniera Sueca.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
