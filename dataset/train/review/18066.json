Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,\" Trump said Jan. 8 in his prime time address on the border wall. \"They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\"", "That\u2019s a mischaracterization of the barrier that won Democratic support 13 years ago.", "Just over half of Democrats in the Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, including then-Sens. Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Most Democrats in the House voted against it, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi.", "The law authorized a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2015, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had constructed 654 miles of fencing, the Government Accountability Office reported.", "The fence was different from the wall Trump promised to build on the campaign trail, which he said would be made of \"hardened concrete\" as tall as \"95 stories\" with a \"very big, very beautiful door.\"", "Trump derided the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign \u2014 he said it was \"not a wall\" but a \"little fence\" that could be scaled with a ladder.", "\"Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental \u2014 probably a snake was in the way or a toad,\" Trump said.

The language made it so that the funds could only be used on repairing or extending fencing that had already been built under the 2006 law.", "We\u2019re rated similar statements in which the Trump administration has claimed Democrats wanted a wall\u00a0as Half True, but here, Trump goes farther. Democrats have not changed their stance on the border fencing they previously supported;\u00a0they simply don\u2019t support the more ambitious wall Trump proposes.", "Trump said Schumer has \"has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\"", "Schumer, along with tens of other Democrats including former President Barack Obama, voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. That\u2019s the majority of the barrier in place today along the southern border.", "However, the fence was mocked as a \"nothing wall\" by Trump in the past and was far less ambitious, both politically and physically, than the wall Trump wants to build now.", "Finally, Trump says the Democrats no longer support their previous position simply because he wants it.
