["Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden campaigns at a home in Detroit, Sept. 9, 2020. (AP)", "\u2022 The photo doesn\u2019t show Biden\u2019s current house.", "\u2022 Biden bought the property in 1975 for $185,000. He renovated and sold it for $1.2 million in 1996.", "Social media users are circulating a claim about a house purportedly owned by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and questioning how he could afford it on a government salary.", "Eric Trump, President Donald Trump\u2019s son, tweeted the aerial-view photo of the Delaware mansion with this comment: \"The salary of a U.S. senator is $174,000 per year. This is Joe Biden\u2019s house. ... seems legit.\" The tweet has been shared more than 50,000 times.", "The salary of a U.S. senator rose to $174,000 in 2009, the year Biden left the chamber to become vice president. But Eric Trump\u2019s tweet juxtaposed that figure with the photo of a mansion that hasn\u2019t belonged to Biden in nearly 25 years. Biden bought the house in 1975 for $185,000, then sold it in 1996 after major renovations.", "The image comes from a Wall Street Journal article about Biden\u2019s real estate investments. Wall Street Journal staffers confirmed they used Pictometry, an aerial imaging service, to download the satellite image of the property. The same article reported that Biden purchased the DuPont mansion in 1975 for $185,000, and sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million. He does not currently own it.", "A parcel search for the Delaware address on New Castle County\u2019s website confirmed that Biden sold the property in 1996. The New York Times also reported the sale in a 2008 article, which said Biden initially bought the property after he learned it was slated for demolition.", "The Eric Trump tweet cites a Senate salary figure of $174,000 to suggest that the mansion would have been beyond Biden\u2019s means. Biden\u2019s salary as a senator varied from $42,500 a year when he began serving in the Senate in 1973, to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. As vice president, he earned up to $230,700 a year, and his wife, Jill, continued her teaching career.", "But after he left office, both Bidens wrote books, and his financial disclosure form lists dozens of speaking engagements and book-tour events that typically earned him five- and six-figure payments each. The couple, who file their taxes jointly, reported adjusted gross income of about $11 million in 2017.", "Biden\u2019s campaign confirmed that he owns two Delaware properties, a house on a 4-acre lakefront lot in Wilmington and a vacation house on Rehoboth Beach, Del.", "The campaign also directed PolitiFact to Richard Ben Cramer\u2019s book, \"What It Takes,\" which describes some of the work Biden put into the home he sold.", "The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.", "The tweet claimed that a photo of a Delaware mansion was Biden\u2019s current home, and appears to question how he paid for the property with a senator\u2019s salary.", "Biden bought the mansion in 1975 for $185,000, when his salary was about $42,500, then sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million after a renovation.
