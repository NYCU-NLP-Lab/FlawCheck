(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)", "The post and others like it are based on actual events related to the death of high-ranking Iranian official Qassem Soleimani due to a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 2. However, many of the posts are misleading because they leave out important context.", "Reports of an $80 million bounty stem from remarks at Soleimani\u2019s funeral procession in the northeastern city of Mashhad that were aired on Iranian state television. Footage from state TV, including the remarks in the original Farsi, were tweeted by NBC News Tehran correspondent Ali Arouzi.", "At the funeral procession, which was a highly choreographed, state-run event with a national audience, a speaker called on Iranians \"to donate $1 each in order to gather an $80 million bounty on President Trump\u2019s head,\" Arouzi wrote.", "The population of Iran is a little bit over 80 million, so $1 each would be roughly $80 million.", "There\u2019s a caveat, however. The $80 million bounty was a suggestion by a eulogist at the funeral \u2014 not official Iranian government policy.", "We asked Farhad Souzanchi \u2014 a Farsi speaker who founded the Rouhani Meter fact-checking website, which covers Iranian politics \u2014 to review the video clip from the funeral. Souzanchi said that Arouzi\u2019s summary of the speaker\u2019s words was accurate.", "Souzanchi said the eulogist prefaced his remarks by saying that \"this is a voluntary suggestion from the people of Mashhad on behalf of all Iranians.\"", "While the bounty has made a splash on U.S. social media, Souzanchi, who monitors Iranian media, told PolitiFact that the bounty proposal \"hasn't made much news\" in Iran. He said the speaker, whose identity PolitiFact has been unable to confirm, was not familiar to him either.", "Other Iran experts urged not taking the bounty threat too seriously.", "\"I would not touch it with a 10 foot pole,\" said Mark J. Gasiorowski, a specialist in Iran and the Middle East at Tulane University.", "Arang Keshavarzian, an associate professor of Middle East studies at New York University, said he agrees with Souzanchi that there\u2019s no indication in the Iranian media that the bounty is becoming a serious policy proposal.", "Social media posts have said Iran has placed a bounty of $80 million on Trump\u2019s head. A eulogist at Soleimani\u2019s funeral made this proposal, but there is no evidence that it is something being seriously considered by the Iranian government", "We rate the statement Mostly False.", "Instagram post, Jan. 6, 2020", "Ali Arouzi, tweet, Jan. 5, 2020", "World Bank, world population, accessed Jan. 8, 2020", "Al Arabiya, \"Soleimani funeral procession eulogist puts prize on Trump\u2019s head,\" Jan. 5, 2020", "Business Insider, \"A speaker taking part in Qassem Soleimani's funeral procession said anyone who assassinates Trump should get an $80 million bounty,\" Jan. 6, 2020", "Snopes.com, \"Did Iran Offer an $80 million bounty on Trump\u2019s head?\" Jan. 6, 2020", "Email interview with Farhad Souzanchi, founder of the Rouhani Meter, Jan. 7, 2020", "Email interview with Mark J.
