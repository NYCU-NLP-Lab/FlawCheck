["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "The Republican Party of Florida has wasted no time launching attacks against Democrat Alex Sink, the former state CFO who just announced her run for the late C.W. Bill Young\u2019s congressional seat.", "There\u2019s a lot of different claims out there, most of which are summed up in a YouTube ad:", "\"As Florida\u2019s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state\u2019s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida\u2019s debt.\"", "We\u2019ve already checked Sink\u2019s ties to the pension fund. In this fact-check, we\u2019ll look into her relationship to the Florida debt.", "First things first: We broke down the state debt level at the end of each fiscal year, according to a report by the Division of Bond Finance. Dollar figures are in billions.", "The GOP subtracted the 2006 number from the 2010 number, which does give us a difference of $5.2 billion. But since Sink took office in January 2007, the first budget she was in office for was fiscal year 2008, and the last would\u2019ve been 2011. When we take that difference, we get $3.4 billion. It\u2019s still a significant amount of debt, to be sure, but it\u2019s not quite as high as the ad made it out to be.", "As we\u2019ve noted in similar fact-checks, the implication here is that Sink in particular played a large role in increasing Florida\u2019s debt. As chief financial officer from 2007 to 2011, her duties included accounting, auditing and managing Florida\u2019s finances, in addition to serving on the State Board Administration with the governor and attorney general.", "In Florida, legislators are required to balance the budget each year, unlike in the federal government. But the state can issue bonds to pay for capital improvement projects like road improvements and the construction of educational facilities. A significant part of the debt during Sink's term was $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds to add class space to the state's schools, brought about by a 2002 amendment to the Florida Constitution that reduced class sizes.", "Additionally, while the CFO oversees finances, it's the state Legislature that passes a budget.", "\"It\u2019s the Legislature who decides how much bonding is going to be done,\" said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues.", "The Cabinet and the governor sign off on the Division of Bond Finance\u2019s bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects. The Cabinet consists of three members, including the the CFO, the attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture.", "Neither the Republican Party of Florida nor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could point us to an instance where Sink voted against issuing bonds. But approving the bond issues is business as usual for the governor and Cabinet, so it\u2019s routine for the vote to pass without disagreement.", "It is considered acceptable for the CFO to disagree with the governor on financial matters, said Susan MacManus, University of South Florida state government professor. But the fact that so many Cabinet and legislative officials (many of whom were Republicans) get a say in appropriations means the financial blame doesn\u2019t fall to Sink alone.", "\"You can\u2019t say that she has no responsibility for it,\" MacManus said. \"You could probably say that it\u2019s shared responsibility.\"", "The CFO also doesn\u2019t have the same veto power the governor does over bond appropriations, said Khi Thai, Florida Atlantic University public budgeting professor.", "\"Alex Sink can express her \u2018support\u2019 but cannot \u2018vote down\u2019 the Legislature's bond appropriations,\" Thai added.", "Aside from that distinction, it\u2019s worth remembering that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink\u2019s term as CFO, not just Florida. The state\u2019s trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation\u2019s. Florida government, be it the Legislature or the Cabinet, shouldn\u2019t shoulder all the blame for a widespread recession.", "Our ruling", "As CFO, Sink did watch the debt increase over her term, but by $3.4 billion, not $5.2 billion. Plus, the Legislature, not the Cabinet, has most of the say in bond appropriations. Not to mention there was a nationwide recession that took its toll on the Florida economy, which is out of the hands of state officials. Given all these hefty clarifications, we rate the Florida Republican Party of Florida\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "Division of Bond Finance, \"State of Florida 2012 Debt Affordability Report,\" Dec. 2012", "Email interview with David Bergstein, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman, Oct. 31, 2013", "Email interview with Khi Thai, Florida Atlantic University public budgeting professor", "Email interview with Susan Hepworth, Florida GOP spokeswoman, Oct. 30, 2013", "Florida GOP, \"Alex Sink\u2019s History of Failures,\" Oct. 30, 2013", "Florida Legislature, \"The 2013 Florida Statutes Chapter 17.61,\" accessed Nov. 5, 2013", "Phone interview with Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch VP for tax research, Oct. 31, 2013", "Phone interview with Susan MacManus, University of South Florida state government professor, Nov. 5, 2013", "PolitiFact Florida, \"Rick Scott Says Debt Was Up $5.2B Under Charlie Crist, Down $2B Under Scott,\" Jan. 9, 2013", "PolitiFact Florida, \"RPOF Chairman Lenny Curry Says Rick Scott Cut State Debt By $2 Billion, Charlie Crist Increased It By $5 Billion,\" April 17, 2013", "Tampa Bay Times, \"Alex Sink is Running for C.W.
