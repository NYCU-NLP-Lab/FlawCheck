["Pro-business pundits are pushing back against progressive politicians who argue that, given America\u2019s wealth inequality, the U.S. tax code should not allow billionaires to exist.", "Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo fired back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who said it\u2019s morally wrong that billionaires can coexist alongside people living in extreme poverty. Ocasio-Cortez has discussed a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income that exceeds $10 million a year.", "Bartiromo called this view \"quite naive,\" saying high earners already pay their fair share. Besides, they would have less incentive to work hard if a larger portion of their income went to fund the government, she argued.", "\"What is it going to do to the economy if you make it so economically difficult for the highest earners?\" Bartiromo said on Fox News, via satellite from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"According to the Tax Foundation, the top 10 percent of earners already pay almost 80 percent of all taxes. So you already have the highest earners paying their fair share.\"", "We\u2019ll leave it to others to debate whether taxes on the wealthy should stay flat or go up. Here, we wanted to know if the numbers Bartiromo cited reflect the proportion of taxes paid by the rich. Turns out, they\u2019re pretty far off.", "Bartiromo did not reply to our request for comment. But a post on Fox News\u2019 website about her response to Ocasio-Cortez cited the pro-business Tax Foundation.", "We reached out to the Tax Foundation, which pointed us to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0that\u00a0summarized the latest federal income and tax data from the\u00a0Congressional Budget Office's\u00a0\"Distribution of Household Income, 2015,\"\u00a0including individual and corporate income tax, payroll and excise taxes. The numbers were not as high as what Bartiromo said.", "The following chart shows the share of the aforementioned federal taxes paid by America\u2019s top earners. The three bars on the left give a granular view of the top 10 percent of earners\u2019 tax burden. The blue bar on the right shows the top decile\u2019s overall share.", "According to the latest federal data, which a Tax Foundation analyst confirmed, the top 10 percent of earners paid around 55 percent of all federal taxes \u2014 not almost 80 percent, as Bartiromo said.", "She would have been closer to the mark if she\u2019d limited her claim to income tax, of which the top 10 percent accounted for around 74 percent. However, Bartiromo\u2019s statement referred to \"all taxes.\"", "Bartiromo said, \"According to the Tax Foundation, the top 10 percent of earners already pay almost 80 percent of all taxes.\"", "The latest federal data shows the top 10 percent of earners paid around 55 percent of all federal taxes. Her point that the wealthy pay a lot of taxes was right, but her number was significantly off.", "We rate this Mostly False.", "Fox News, \"Bartiromo Calls Out Ocasio-Cortez's Comments on Billionaires: 'Quite Naive,' \" Jan. 22, 2019", "Congressional Budget Office, \"The Distribution of Household Income, 2015,\" Nov. 2018", "CNBC, \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: A system that allows billionaires to exist alongside extreme poverty is immoral,\" Jan. 22, 2019", "PolitiFact, \"Explaining Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent marginal tax rate idea,\" Jan. 8, 2019", "Washington Post, \"Billionaires in Davos hate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 70% tax on the rich,\" Jan. 23, 2019", "Tax Foundation, \"Summary of the Latest Federal Income Tax Data, 2017 Update,\" Jan. 17, 2018", "Tax Foundation, \"America Already Has a Progressive Tax System,\" Jan. 11, 2019", "Email interview with John Buhl, media relations manager at the Tax Foundation, Jan. 23-24, 2019", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
