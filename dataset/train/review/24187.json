["About this rating", "A popular quote supposedly from William Shakespeare about how he always felt happy has been around various parts of the Internet for several years. We have seen this quote attached to the famous playwright on blogs, social media posts, Spanish-language books about tarot cards, and, of course, dozens of memes:", "The exact wording of this quote can change from post to post, but the following text seems to be the most prevalent version:", "I always feel happy, you know why? Because I don\u2019t expect anything from anyone; expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be happy. And keep smiling.", "Just live for yourself and always remember:", "Before you speak\u2026 Listen\nBefore you write\u2026 Think\nBefore you spend\u2026 Earn\nBefore you pray\u2026 Forgive\nBefore you hurt\u2026 Feel\nBefore you hate\u2026 Love\nBefore you quit\u2026 Try\nBefore you die\u2026 Live", "Since Shakespeare lived long before the age of audio and video recording, one would expect a written record of all of his quotes, yet in the dozens of postings that we encountered attributing this quote to Shakespeare, not one pointed to an actual source. Furthermore, when we started digging into the actual phrases used in this passage, we found that some portions could be attributed to another author named William \u2014 just not Shakespeare.", "The portion of this quote, starting with \"before you write\" and ending with \"before you die\" appears to have been taken from a poem that was purportedly written by William Arthur Ward, an American author best known for his inspirational maxims. The one notable difference between the fake Shakespeare quote and the poem is that Ward (if it is indeed his poem) ended his text with a call to \"give,\" not \"live\":", "Before you speak, listen.\nBefore you write, think.\nBefore you spend, earn.\nBefore you invest, investigate.\nBefore you criticize, wait.\nBefore you pray, forgive.\nBefore you quit, try.\nBefore you retire, save.\nBefore you die, give.", "Although Ward most likely wrote this poem (it is certainly more aligned with his style than with Shakespeare's more florid prose) we have yet to uncover where it was first published. It was credited simply as a \"Catholic quote\" when it appeared in a Kansas newspaper in 1969:", "A much longer version of this quote contains several other curious pieces of text. The closing line, for instance, states that a \"strong person\" should be able to hold back tears and smile:", "Una persona fuerte sabe c\u00f3mo mantener en orden su vida. A\u00fan con l\u00e1grimas en los ojos, se las arregla para decir con una sonrisa \u201cEstoy bien\u201d.", "A strong person knows how to keep his life in order. Even with tears in his eyes, he manages to say with a smile, \"I'm fine\".", "There's no evidence that Shakespeare wrote this, either. In fact, before this quote was attributed to him, it was part of a religious Facebook chain message, and was shared with no attribution.", "We reached out to the Folger Shakespeare Library to find out more about this spurious quote and were told that there was no record of this passage in their archives. The Bard did, however, write that \"life is short\" at least once. From Henry IV, Part 1:", "I cannot read them now.\nO gentlemen, the time of life is short!\nTo spend that shortness basely were too long,\nIf life did ride upon a dial's point,\nStill ending at the arrival of an hour.\nAn if we live, we live to tread on kings;\nIf die, brave death, when princes die with us!\nNow, for our consciences, the arms are fair,\nWhen the intent of bearing them is just.", "Shakespeare also touched on expectations in the play All's Well That Ends Well:", "Oft expectation fails and most oft there\nWhere most it promises, and oft it hits\nWhere hope is coldest and despair most fits.", "This viral Shakespeare \"quote,\" then, is merely a pastiche of general platitudes. Although it may have touched on some of the general ideas that William Shakespeare wrote about, the included prose was certainly not written by the Bard himself.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
