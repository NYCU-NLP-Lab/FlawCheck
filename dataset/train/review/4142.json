["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on July 2, 2019", "President\u00a0Donald Trump described\u00a0a security treaty with Japan as an \u201cunfair agreement\u201d negotiated by \u201cstupid\u201d American officials in which\u00a0\u201cJapan doesn\u2019t have to help us at all\u201d if the U.S. is attacked. But that ignores the benefits in the treaty for the U.S.", "The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which dates to 1951, gives the U.S. a strategic military presence in Japan to protect a \u201crange of U.S. security interests in East Asia,\u201d as explained by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in a July 2009 report.", "\u201cThose concerns include the development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programs, the presence of militant Islamic groups based in Southeast Asia, the possibility of conflict with China over Taiwan, and the overall ascendance of China as a potential challenger to U.S. influence in the region,\u201d the CRS report said.", "The president on at least two occasions in recent days has been critical of the U.S.-Japan security agreement, including in a June 26\u00a0interview on Fox Business Network prior to his trip to the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan (at about the 13:25 mark).", "Trump, June 26: We have a treaty with Japan, if Japan is attacked we will fight World War 3. We will go in and we will protect them and we will fight with our lives and with our treasure. We will fight at all costs. Right? But we\u2019re attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us at all. They can watch it on a Sony television, the attack. So, there\u2019s a little difference \u2013 OK?", "Three days later, Trump was asked at a press conference\u00a0in Osaka if he was considering pulling out of the mutual security agreement.", "Trump, June 29:\u00a0No, I\u2019m not thinking about that at all.\u00a0I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s an unfair agreement. And I\u2019ve told [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe] that for the last six months. I said, \u201cLook, if somebody attacks Japan, we go after them and we are in a battle \u2014 full force in effect.\u201d We are locked in a battle and committed to fight for Japan. If somebody should attack the United States, they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s unfair. That\u2019s the kind of deals we made. That\u2019s \u2014 every deal is like that. I mean it\u2019s almost like we had people that they didn\u2019t either care or they were stupid. But that\u2019s the kind of deals we have. That\u2019s just typical.", "The president said he has told Prime Minister Abe that he wants to change the treaty. \u201c[I]f we\u2019re helping them,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to have help us.\u201d", "Left unsaid was how the U.S. already benefits from the treaty.", "According to\u00a0U.S. Forces, Japan, the\u00a0U.S. currently has about 54,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan on 85 facilities throughout the archipelago \u2014 a collection of islands that make up Japan. That includes about 11,000 U.S. forces stationed at sea off the coast of Russia, North Korea and South Korea and near China.", "\u201cHe views Japan too narrowly and bilaterally,\u201d Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, told us. \u201c[T]he bases it provides us make Japan a hugely important hub for all our activities in the region. Our presence also helps anchor Japan in a solid security relationship, preventing a possible return to the dynamics of the 1930s that ultimately dragged us into World War II.\u201d", "Japan and the U.S. agreed to a security treaty\u00a0on Sept. 8, 1951 \u2014 the same day that the countries also signed a peace treaty that ended the U.S. occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952 after World War II. At the time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisted on the separate security agreement giving the U.S. a military presence in Japan in exchange for ending the U.S. occupation.", "\u201c[T]he proposed peace treaty must not be permitted to become effective without the coming into effect simultaneously of a bilateral United States\u2013Japan treaty of security,\u201d Hoyt S. Vanderberg, the then-chief of staff for the U.S. Air Force, wrote on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in an\u00a0April 17, 1951, memo to Defense Secretary George Marshall.\u00a0Marshall forwarded the memo to the secretary of state with a note to pay attention to particular paragraphs of the memo, including one section that said, in part, \u201cThe Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly recommend that all security provisions therein be adhered to without relaxation.\u201d", "Marshall, a few years earlier as secretary of state, devised the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for the Marshall Plan. The\u00a0security treaty he supported entered into force on April 28, 1952.", "James L. Schoff, senior fellow in the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Trump\u2019s comments about the security treaty \u201cshows an ignorance of history.\u201d The peace and security treaties were designed to prevent Japan from reestablishing the Japanese empire.", "\u201cYou come out of a war where Japan had occupied a third of China and had all of Manchuria, Korea, Taiwan,\u201d Schoff said in an interview with FactCheck.org. \u201cThere was a Japanese empire and feeling that if we don\u2019t neuter this country it will come back and threaten us again.\u201d", "Revised in 1960, the\u00a0Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security\u00a0continued to allow a U.S. military presence in Japan \u201cin exchange for a U.S. pledge to defend Japan in the event of an attack,\u201d as explained in a 2014 paper about the security alliance written for the Council on Foreign Relations website.", "That treaty was signed by Secretary of State Christian A. Herter and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II\u00a0under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was the supreme commander of the Allied forces during World War II. It\u00a0recognized Japan\u2019s right to self defense, but also reaffirmed the constitutional limits placed on Japan\u2019s military might.", "Chapter 2 of Japan\u2019s\u00a0post-WWII Constitution,\u00a0which was drafted by U.S. officials, prohibits the country from maintaining a military for offensive capabilities.", "\u201cSomebody could say [the security treaty] is unfair,\u201d Schoff said, \u201cbut we essentially wrote the Constitution that prohibits Japan from having war potential.\u201d", "During the 2016 campaign, Trump complained about the cost of the U.S. military presence in Japan. However, as we wrote at the time, both countries share the financial burden. The U.S. spends about $2.7 billion and Japan contributes $2 billion for U.S. troops in Japan, according to an Oct. 19, 2018, CRS report to Congress on U.S.-Japan relations. That report also cited the financial benefits of having troops stationed in Japan.", "\u201cU.S. defense officials often cite the strategic advantage of forward-deploying the most advanced American military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific at a far lower cost than stationing troops on American soil,\u201d the report said.", "One former defense official \u2014 retired U.S. Marine Corp. Gen. John R. Allen \u2014 co-wrote a paper in July 2016\u00a0that said the U.S.-Japan alliance remains vital to peace and stability in Northeast Asia, describing it as \u201cimperative to addressing the rise of China and the provocations of North Korea.\u201d", "\u201cThreats in Northeast Asia will most likely continue to diversify for the near future, and therefore the relevance of the U.S.-Japan alliance will only increase in maintaining regional stability,\u201d Allen wrote for the nonpartisan Brookings Institute, where he is now the president.", "Allen, Schoff and CRS also cited Japan\u2019s support for\u00a0U.S.-led military campaigns, including in Afghanistan and Iraq, within its constitutional limits. CRS said Japan has interpreted its constitution to allow it to \u201cparticipate in noncombat roles overseas in a number of U.N. peacekeeping missions and in the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq.\u201d", "\u201cThe idea that Japan would just sit back and not care [if the U.S. was attacked] is simply not true nor borne out by the track record,\u201d Schoff said. \u201cIn Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, 9/11. It has always stepped up to help have our back.\u201d", "We take no position on whether the U.S. should renegotiate the U.S.-Japan security treaty. However, the president on at least two occasions now has given a one-sided view of the treaty \u2014 its place in history and its role in advancing U.S. strategic interests in Northeast Asia.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
