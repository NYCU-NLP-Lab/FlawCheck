Rob Portman to the notorious former president of Haiti, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, during the final Ohio Senate debate.", "\"There's only one of the two of us standing before this audience that's ever been a registered lobbyist, and that's you, senator,\" Strickland said. \"Your first job as a lobbyist was with the Chinese-based firm. You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people.\"", "Strickland\u2019s charge is a mixed bag of accuracy.", "After losing his re-election bid to Republican Gov. John Kasich, Strickland oversaw the lobbying and activism arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, but he was not a lobbyist himself.", "There\u2019s no doubt that Portman, however, was a registered foreign agent, a title that can involve lobbying.", "As PolitiFact Ohio has previously reported, Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs & Blow after graduating from University of Michigan's law school in 1984.", "The Strickland campaign sent us a Buzzfeed article showing Portman\u2019s 1985 foreign agent registration form.

He never lobbied on behalf of Haiti or any other foreign government.", "In 2005, Portman was named by President George W. Bush as his U.S. Trade Representative, a position that can\u2019t be held by anyone who\u2019s ever lobbied for foreign governments.", "Being tapped for the position prompted an affidavit from Stuart Pape, a former managing partner of Portman's law firm dated April 12, 2005. Pape said Portman filed the foreign agent registration form because he was working for the Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., the \"Chinese-based firm\" Strickland referred to.", "But Pape said he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for Haiti or any foreign government.", "On Portman\u2019s campaign website, the Haiti registration is explained as \"standard procedure\" at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys.
