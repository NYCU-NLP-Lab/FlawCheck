["By Eugene Kiely", "Posted on January 21, 2020", "Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler went too far when he claimed that President Donald Trump \u201cworked with the Russians to try to rig the 2016 election.\u201d The special counsel investigation found there were \u201cmultiple contacts \u2026 between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government,\u201d but it \u201cdid not establish \u2026 coordination\u201d between the two.", "Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, made his remarks on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d while discussing the Senate impeachment trial. Margaret Brennan, the host, asked Nadler about the White House legal team\u2019s response to the articles of impeachment.", "The impeachment trial deals with a different set of allegations against Trump, stemming from the president\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and to look into CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm the Democratic National Committee hired after its server was hacked during the 2016 election.", "Nadler, Jan. 19: The GAO, the General Accountability Office, just came out this week and pointed out that withholding money from\u2013 from Ukraine that Congress had appropriated is against the law. But we didn\u2019t need them to tell us that. And the reason he did that was in order to extort a foreign government to \u2014 to \u2014 to smear his political opponents for his personal benefits and to help try to rig the 2020 election as he worked with the Russians to try to rig the 2016 election. Same pattern.", "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities,\u201d according to a redacted report released on April 18, 2019.", "Nadler\u2019s spokseman, Daniel Schwarz, told us in an email that Mueller\u2019s report found evidence that the Trump campaign attempted to \u201csolicit help from the Russians.\u201d", "\u201cMueller did not criminally charge, but he did not in fact find that there was no attempt to collect information or solicit help from the Russians,\u201d Schwarz said. \u201cIn fact, that is exactly what was found.\u201d", "That\u2019s true, but that\u2019s not what Nadler said.", "As the Mueller report says, there were \u201cmultiple contacts \u2026 between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.\u201d For instance, Donald Trump Jr. received an email on June 3, 2016, promising information from the Russian government that would damage Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign. The email was sent by music publicist Rob Goldstone at the direction of Russian pop star Emin Agalarov and on behalf of Agalarov\u2019s father, Aras, a Russian real estate developer.", "\u201cEmin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting,\u201d Goldstone wrote to Trump\u2019s eldest son. \u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d", "Trump Jr. responded, \u201c[I]f it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d Six days later, he attended a meeting arranged by Goldstone with Natalia Veselnitskaya, who the Mueller report said \u201chad previously worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout this period of time.\u201d Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior adviser Jared Kushner also attended the June 9, 2016, meeting. But the investigation found it lasted just 20 minutes, and there is no proof that anything came of it.", "\u201c[T]he Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump\u2019s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer\u2019s presentation did not provide such information,\u201d the Mueller report said.", "It\u2019s also true, as the Mueller report says, that the Trump campaign took political advantage of emails and other documents stolen by the Russian government hackers and released by WikiLeaks that were damaging to Clinton\u2019s campaign. In the final weeks of his campaign, Trump repeatedly read from the documents released by WikiLeaks and, as we wrote, often distorted the facts.", "As they would later disclose, Trump Jr. made direct contact with WikiLeaks\u2019 Twitter account and Trump confidant Roger Stone\u00a0exchanged Twitter messages\u00a0with Guccifer 2.0, which the Mueller report describes as one of two \u201conline personas\u201d used by Russian military intelligence to release hacked emails to media outlets and WikiLeaks.", "According to the Mueller report, \u201cThe release of the documents was designed and timed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.\u201d", "Trump himself at a July 27, 2016, press conference invited Russia to find tens of thousands of Clinton\u2019s personal emails that had been deleted. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said. Within five hours of that statement, Russian intelligence officers \u201ctargeted for the first time Clinton\u2019s personal office,\u201d the Mueller report said.", "But, again, the investigation did not establish that Trump or anyone affiliated with his campaign was involved in the hacking or coordinated the release of the hacked materials with the Russian government.", "\u201cThe Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve potential Russia-related contacts,\u201d the Mueller report said. \u201cFor example, the investigation established that interactions between Russian Ambassador [Sergey] Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate\u2019s April 2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that one Campaign official\u2019s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and [Trump campaign surrogate and Sen. Jeff] Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions\u2019s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.\u201d", "(We covered examples of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives in our April 18, 2019, story \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Russian Contacts.\u201d)", "Nadler\u2019s spokesman has a point that the Trump campaign made the \u201cattempt to collect information or solicit help from the Russians.\u201d That\u2019s clear from the Mueller report, which says just because \u201cthe investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.\u201d", "But, in the end, the special counsel\u2019s office summarized its findings on the coordination this way: \u201cIn sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russia offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d", "That said, Nadler went too far when he stated as fact that Trump \u201cworked with the Russians to try to rig the 2016 election.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
