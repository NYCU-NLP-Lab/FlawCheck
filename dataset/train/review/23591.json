["About this rating", "It wouldn't be Christmas without stories about the \"war on Christmas,\" at least not for the making of viral news. One such story involved a rather expansive list of holiday-themed items deemed \"not acceptable\" for holiday classroom adornment by the principal of one Nebraska elementary school.", "Manchester Elementary principal Jennifer Sinclair sent a memorandum to parents and students informing them that candy canes were off limits because \"Historically, the shape [of the candy cane] is a 'J' for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes.\"", "The list essentially banned any Christmas-specific decor or activities, including Christmas carols and music, reindeer, Elf on the Shelf, and red and green items, but it allowed for non-Christmas winter imagery such as yetis, penguins and \"snowmen, snow women, snow people, snowflakes\":", "Acceptable practices:", "Gifts to students\nStudents making gift for a loved one\nSnowmen, snow women, snow people, snowflakes\nGingerbread people\nHolidays Around the World - purposeful presentation of information to teach\nabout different cultures\nSledding\nHot chocolate\nPolar Bears\nPenguins\nScarves, boots, earmuffs, and hats\nYetis\nOlaf - Frozen", "Not acceptable:", "Santas or Christmas items (clipart) on worksheets\nChristmas trees in classrooms\nElf on the Shelf - that\u2019s Christmas-related\nSinging Christmas Carols\nPlaying Christmas music\nSending a Scholastic book that is a Christmas book - that\u2019s Christmas-related\nMaking a Christmas ornament as a gift - This assumes that the family has\na Christmas tree which assumes they celebrate Christmas.

This issue was limited to Manchester Elementary School and did not arise at any other schools within the District.", "Ironically, Sinclair's objection to candy canes as a representation of Jesus Christ was based on a mistaken belief.
