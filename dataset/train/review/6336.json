["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on November 6, 2020", "Facebook users are sharing a meme that alleges a host of inaccuracies in Detroit\u2019s voter rolls in the context of the 2020 election. But the claims stem from a 2019 lawsuit that was withdrawn after the group that filed it said the city had taken action on the issues.", "A purported screenshot of a TV news report out of Detroit, Michigan, is circulating on Facebook \u2014 misleadingly propelling outdated claims about the city\u2019s voter rolls in the context of the 2020 election.", "The screenshot is alleged to be a report from a Fox 2 report in Detroit that outlines a lawsuit claiming a number of issues \u2014 including thousands of duplicates and dead people \u2014 with the city\u2019s rolls.", "\u201cAnd so it begins!!!\u201d reads text above the screenshot in a meme.", "\u201cStraight out of Fox 2 in Michigan,\u201d reads another, posted Nov. 4.", "But the claims in the viral image were part of a lawsuit filed in late 2019 that was voluntarily withdrawn earlier this year after the organization behind it said the city had largely resolved the issues.", "The screenshot shows an alleged Fox 2 report whose headline reads, \u201cDetroit Voter Roll Lawsuit.\u201d Beneath it are bullets of claims from the lawsuit: \u201c4,788 duplicate registrations,\u201d \u201c32,519 more registered voters than eligible voters,\u201d \u201c2,503 dead people registered\u201d and \u201cone voter born in 1823.\u201d", "(While the station did cover the lawsuit, it has said the viral image \u201cwas never part of our original story.\u201d)", "The claims shown in the image were indeed put forward by the Indiana-based Public Interest Legal Foundation, which filed a federal lawsuit against Detroit in December 2019. The legal group has sued a number of cities around the country over voter roll maintenance. The Brennan Center for Justice, which represented parties intervening in the Detroit case, has countered that the foundation has used \u201cexaggerated claims\u201d in such cases.", "Detroit disputed the allegations in court, saying that some were inaccurate or overstated \u2014 and that it had already resolved some of the apparent inaccuracies by the time of the lawsuit.", "For example, in a declaration filed with the court, Director of Elections George Azzouz said Detroit had already removed almost all of the names that were alleged to be duplicates or deceased. And the voter said to have a birthdate of 1823 was in fact born in 1983 and registered in 2008, he said, so the matter was a typographical error.", "We should note \u2014 as we\u2019ve written before when addressing studies looking at such issues \u2014 the presence of outdated and inaccurate voter registration records is not itself evidence of voter fraud.", "And in this case, the foundation dropped its lawsuit in June \u2014 months after it was filed.", "The foundation\u2019s filing to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit said that it had been able to \u201cascertain that remedial actions were taken after the filing of this lawsuit.\u201d", "\u201cDefendants have taken action on the list of likely deceased registrants provided by the Plaintiff,\u201d the group said. \u201cFurther, almost all of the duplicate registrations that Plaintiff brought to Defendants\u2019 attention have been corrected.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
