One of the issues receiving the most attention is whether, or to what extent, Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice misled the American public about the incident when she offered talking points on five Sunday morning talk shows on Sept. 16, 2012.", "The criticism has focused on whether Rice was playing down the possibility that the attack in Benghazi was a pre-planned event carried out by terrorists, as opposed to flowing organically from a series of public protests at U.S. facilities throughout the Arab world following the news reports about a movie made in the U.S. that mocked Islam.", "At the press briefing, Carney responded to questions about Rice\u2019s talking points by saying, \"If you look at the issue here, the efforts to politicize it were always about were we trying to play down the fact that there was an act of terror and an attack on the embassy. \u00a0\u2026 Susan Rice, when she went out on the Sunday shows using the very talking points that we're discussing now, talked about the possibility that we knew that, or believed based on the intelligence assessment, that extremists were involved, and there were suspicions about what affiliations those extremists might have, but there were not \u2026 hard, concrete evidence. And so Ambassador Rice, in those shows, talked about the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists (might be involved), which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down. It was simply a reflection of we did not, and the intelligence community did not, and others within the administration did not, jump to conclusions about who was responsible before we had an investigation to find out the facts.\"", "So was Carney correct that she mentioned al-Qaida and did not try to \"play that down\"?", "We asked the White House for evidence, but didn't hear back by publication time. So we went back to the transcripts of Rice\u2019s appearances on five shows -- CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, CNN\u2019s State of the Union, NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Fox News Sunday and ABC\u2019s This Week.

But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution.

That violence is absolutely unacceptable, it's not a response that one can ever condone when it comes to such a video.

The information, the best information and the best assessment we have today is that in fact this was not a preplanned, premeditated attack. That what happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video.

But it\u2019s worth noting that Rice portrayed these extremists as opportunists who seized the moment during a public uprising, which is something quite different from the pre-planned terrorist attack that the administration\u2019s critics are charging the White House initially played down. Indeed, Rice explicitly, and repeatedly, shot down speculation that the attack was planned in advance, for instance telling Schieffer, \"We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.\"", "Did Rice play down any of the three listed scenarios?", "Yes. In the one interview of the five in which she mentioned al-Qaida at all, she urged caution about assuming they were involved. And while she did allow that \"extremists\" appeared to have been involved in the attack, she made a point of saying in every interview that these extremists got involved only by hijacking an ongoing event that protested the anti-Islam film, a narrative that gives almost a secondary role to the extremists. Meanwhile, in three of the five interviews, Rice specifically rejected the idea that Benghazi amounted to a preplanned terrorist attack.", "Our ruling", "Carney said that Rice \"talked about the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists (might be involved), which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down.\"", "It\u2019s true that Rice offered those three scenarios, but Carney is wrong to say she didn\u2019t play them down. Rice barely mentioned the potential role of al-Qaida or one of its affiliates, and she urged caution about jumping to conclusions on the one occasion in which she did.", "And while she did point to a role for \"extremists,\" Rice made clear that the extremists didn\u2019t pre-plan the attack, but instead hijacked a demonstration that was already under way.", "Both decisions played down, to one degree or another, each of the three scenarios she mentioned.
