And now he is applying the technology to combat COVID-19, with encouraging early results.", "When the coronavirus pandemic began, Sen thought about ways his research could help, he said in a YouTube video released through Indiana University.", "\"We tried to put some time into understanding the physical make of this virus, and are there perhaps some weak points we could target,\" Sen said.", "Sen detailed the potential application to COVID-19 on May 14, 2020, in a preliminary study released online at the preprint server ChemRxiv. The site publishes early versions of studies ahead of formal peer review and publication.", "Coronaviruses in general rely on electrostatic interactions to assemble themselves into an infective form and attach to a host.", "The electroceutical fabric consists of polyester printed with a series of metal dots \u2014 alternating silver and zinc \u2014 printed on the fabric in a geometric pattern. There is no wire or external battery, but these metals when exposed to moisture create microcell batteries that generate an electrical charge.", "\"We thought then our dressing (could be) capable of disrupting those electrostatic forces, and we started testing it and the results have seemed very promising,\" Sen said in the video. \"You\u2019re using a very weak electric field which is not harmful to humans \u2026 but is capable of dismantling bacterial infections, we are currently working on fungal infection, and now we see it can also incapacitate, if you will, viruses.\"", "Vomaris has applied through the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization program to use the fabric for COVID-19 face masks.", "The Indianapolis Star reported May 26, 2020, the company is hoping to use the fabric to develop two products: A washable mask with a disposable electroceutical fabric layer can be inserted, and another mask designed for one-time use.
