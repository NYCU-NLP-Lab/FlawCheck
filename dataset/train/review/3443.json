Dan Patrick opened his full-throated endorsement of Texas legislation targeting transgender access to bathrooms by quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.", "Patrick, joined by the proposal\u2019s author, state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, told reporters at the Texas Capitol on Jan. 5, 2017: \"Martin Luther King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter.", "\"This legislation, the Texas Privacy Act, that Sen. Kolkhorst is filing today, is unquestionably one of the things that matters,\" Patrick said. \"It\u2019s the right thing to do. I know it, Texans know it and Sen. Kolkhorst knows it.\"", "Debate over the measure--banning transgender people from using the Texas bathroom of their choice--will play out in the 2017 legislative session. We focused on the origin of Patrick\u2019s King quotation.", "Patrick offers no backup", "We didn\u2019t hear back from Patrick about when and where the slain civil rights leader made the singled-out statement, which went noted in the Associated Press\u2019s account of Patrick\u2019s remarks and quoted by the Dallas Morning News.", "For our part, a web search for the quotation and \"King\" suggested by a professor\u00a0yielded 2,980 results including books of poetry and documentation that President Clinton similarly quoted King in an April 2000 speech and Sen. Joe Lieberman did so in the Senate in June 2003.", "So, Patrick was in bipartisan company in crediting the words to King.", "On the other hand, we were unable to confirm that King made that exact declaration. Also, it\u2019s worth noting, King probably didn\u2019t expound on bathrooms except toward widening access to public facilities.", "A photo caption", "We started our look into this topic by trying to gauge if King said the words aired by Patrick.", "Right off, a web search yielded an\u00a0undated New York Daily News photo of King giving a speech. The photo caption said: \"King was engaged in a battle with Sheriff Jim Clark over voting rights and voter registration in Selma. On March 8, 1965, King spoke from the pulpit on courage: \u2018Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\u2019\"", "Stanford researchers can\u2019t confirm", "Separately, though, King experts either said he likely didn\u2019t make the quoted remark or if he did, it\u2019s hard to confirm so with ease. \"That would be a research project,\" said Clayborne Carson, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Centennial professor of history at Stanford University and director of a research institute in King\u2019s name. By phone, Carson told us that\u2019s because the institute\u2019s resources aren\u2019t yet easily\u00a0searched for a particular quotation. Put another way, he said by email, it\u2019s \"easier to prove what King said on a particular occasion than to prove that he never said the quote in question on any occasion.\"", "An institute research assistant, Ellen Ingebritsen, later responded that her search of the project\u2019s internal database and documents culled from the institute's King papers didn\u2019t turn up King making the statement. Then again, she said, the institute has yet to catalogue the majority of King\u2019s work from 1965. Otherwise, she said, King letters and telegrams from that year don\u2019t contain the words attributed to King by Patrick.", "A similar confirmed King statement", "Story over? Not quite.", "Other experts helped us find that King made a similar yet less direct statement in the Brown Chapel in Selma, Ala., on\u00a0Monday, March 8, 1965--the same date noted in the News\u2019s photo caption and also the day after protesters met police violence after attempting to cross a bridge on the way to Montgomery, the state capital.", "King, who would shortly lead a crossing of the bridge before turning around, said in part: \"A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.\"", "Here\u2019s King\u2019s remark in context as we found it on an East Tennessee State University web page:", "\"Deep down in our non-violent creed is the conviction there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true, that they're worth dying for.

Burgess also helped us track down a YouTube video in which we saw King\u00a0making the remarks, which the video attributes to a Nostalgia Company recording, \"The Greatest Speeches of All Time, Volume II.\"", "Separately, Carson told us his research took note of a similar King statement made Nov. 5, 1967, at his home church in Atlanta. King, exhorting parishioners to fight for what\u2019s right, said a person\u2019s failure to do so would amount to dying before death. \"You died when you refused to stand up for right, you died when you refused to stand up for truth, you died when you refused to stand up for justice,\" Carson quoted King saying.", "We also heard back from a King biographer, David Garrow, who said by email that his sense is that King didn\u2019t make the statement aired by Patrick.
