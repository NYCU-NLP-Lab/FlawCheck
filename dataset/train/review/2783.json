Sanford Bishop of Albany objecting to parts of a bill setting the budget for the U.S. Department of Defense. He said it weakened labor laws that protect veterans and other workers from discrimination.\n\nSuch changes would hit veterans hard. They\u2019re already struggling to find work. \u00a0\n\n\"There are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now,\" the Democrat said in the video posted July 23.\n\nIs that correct? We contacted Bishop\u2019s office for more information.\n\nWhile the video was posted recently, the speech was made in December. Bishop\u2019s motion to change the bill failed. \u00a0\n\nBishop\u2019s press secretary, Maxwell Gigle, backed up the claim by sending us news releases from the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs and the congressman\u2019s office.\n\nTwo cited the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official keeper of labor data, as the source of their numbers.\n\nEach month, the agency conducts what\u2019s called the Current Population Survey. This survey collects data on employment, earnings, work hours, demographics and related issues from about 60,000 households across the nation.\n\nThe survey includes questions designed to track the employment status of veterans, which it defines as men and women who previously served on active duty in the U.S. military and were civilians when the survey was conducted.\n\nIn 2011, an average of about 11.3 million veterans were in the workforce, according to the yearly report. Some 945,000 of them were out of work.\n\nVeterans of the wars waged after the 9/11 attacks had the hardest time. About 12.1 \u00a0percent of them were unemployed last year. By contrast, unemployment among all veterans averaged at about 8.3 \u00a0percent.\n\nThe number of unemployed veterans has since dropped to 806,000, according to the BLS\u2019 June 2012 figures. That\u2019s 7.4 percent of the veteran workforce.\n\nWhen Bishop made his speech, the latest data available was from November, when 832,000 \u00a0veterans were unemployed.\n\nVeterans are faring better than U.S. workers as a whole. In June, the unemployment rate for all workers stood at 8.2 percent, according to the BLS.\n\nIn conclusion, Bishop said in his speech before Congress that there were \"close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now.\" This number is a bit lower than the yearly average and higher than the latest unemployment figures available at the time.\n\nHis statement rates a True on the Truth-O-Meter.", "YouTube.com, U.S. Rep.
