Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.\"", "Kurtz did elaborate on the graphic after his show \u2014 not because it was confusing, but because he said the Associated Press ran a story \"that utterly distorts what happened.\"", "\"The AP reported my request to take down the graphic and ended the story there, creating a false impression by not mentioning that I called for the very same graphic shortly afterward,\" Kurtz wrote in an April 9 Facebook post. \"This echoed partisan chatter online that I had somehow panicked or didn\u2019t want to show the poll graphic, which is flatly contradicted by reality.\"", "Kurtz wrote that the graphic was mistakenly posted early, while he was discussing fake news, but brought back later in the show.
