Schools stayed open. All businesses did too\u201d the post reads. \u201cYou could go to the movies. You could go to bars and restaurants.\u201d The post goes on to say that stock markets did not crash, no stay-at-home orders were enforced and no legislation was passed in Congress.", "The post references stories from those who were present at the famous music event that took place on a dairy farm in New York in August 1969 and claims that Woodstock was planned in January 1969 \u201cduring the worse period of death.\u201d", "The post claims the only actions government took were collecting data, encouraging testing and vaccinations, adding that Congress and the media focused on the Vietnam War, civil rights movements and landing on the moon.", "In a piece for the National Review, John Fund recalled his memories during the 1968 pandemic, saying he was just old enough to remember what was going on, as his family lived near the Travis Air Force Base in the Bay Area\u00a0where soldiers returned\u00a0home from Vietnam in 1968.", "\u201cIt amazes me now, but I was able to give my oral report in class because the schools didn\u2019t close in California \u2014 or anywhere else in the country,\u201d Fund\u00a0wrote. He said people still practiced social distancing, rode buses less frequently and washed their hands but people were still going to work.", "Marilyn Brown, owner of See the World Travel & Tours in Harbor City, Calif., shared her story with Travel Weekly about her experiences in 1968, when her son Steven Brown was infected with the virus, and she thought his sickness was just \"a bad flu.\"", "\u201cOther than my coworkers bringing their own alcohol to\u00a0wipe down their desks and wipe down pencils and not use pencils that clients had used, we didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Brown told Travel Weekly.", "A New York Times article from August 1969 reported that dozens of doctors were present at Woodstock to address \u201cthe potential threat of a virus cold or pneumonia epidemic among such a large gathering.\u201d", "The 1968 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the \"Hong Kong Flu,\" was caused by an\u00a0H3N2 avian influenza virus. The first recorded outbreak of the disease was in Hong Kong in the summer of 1968, though some experts theorize\u00a0that the virus may have originated in mainland China.", "The virus, which is still around today, is from a group of avian influenzas that also produced the 1957 flu pandemic\u2019s H2N2 virus.

Researchers speculate this variation in severity is because of prior immunities that people already had because of exposure to the 1957 and possibly 1918 flu pandemics.", "Because the H3N2 virus is prone to antigenic drift, it remains a common seasonal flu even after a vaccine was developed. Edwin Kilbourne, a renowned researcher on influenza prevention, wrote in 2006 that \"the H3N2 subtype still reigns as the major and most troublesome influenza A virus in humans.", "The Wall Street Journal reported the virus came in two different waves. The second outbreak, in the latter half of 1969,\u00a0was deadlier than the first wave from the year prior.", "\u201cGovernments and the media didn\u2019t call for restrictions on public life and economic activity,\u201d the article reads. \u201cThe disease was allowed to run through communities virtually unhindered until a vaccine became available to stop it about four months after it surfaced.\u201d", "Susan Craddock, a professor at the Institute for Global Studies of the University of Minnesota told the WSJ that mortality rates for the 1968 pandemic were much lower than current mortality rates from COVID-19.", "Social distancing\u00a0was also not an idea among public health officials at the time. \u201cThat concept was developed in the 2000s when there was concern about another avian influenza outbreak,\u201d Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, told USA TODAY.", "\u201cHowever, officials decided during the 2009 avian flu outbreak that the virus wasn't severe enough to necessitate those measures. This time is very different,\" he said.", "The Woodstock festival of 1969 did occur amid a global pandemic and no stay at home orders were enforced. However, the concept of social distancing was not yet accepted practice among public health experts and the 1968 flu pandemic was not as deadly as other diseases. Lawmakers also did not face serious public pressure to slow the virus, as the nation's attention was focussed elsewhere.
