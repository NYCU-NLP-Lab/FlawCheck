["U.S. Senate candidate Patty Judge\u2019s role in a 2008 veto of collective bargaining legislation has emerged as a key issue in Iowa\u2019s Democratic primary, and the state\u2019s largest unions have lined\u00a0up against her campaign over her perceived unfriendliness to labor.", "At issue is\u00a0House File 2645, a wide-ranging and controversial bill that expanded collective\u00a0bargaining rights for public employees so that many more aspects of workers\u2019 duties and work conditions could be negotiated. The measure flew through the Democrat-controlled House and Senate, going from introduction to passage in 11 days.", "But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat,\u00a0vetoed the bill. Judge was Culver\u2019s lieutenant governor.", "In his veto message, Culver criticized the manner in which HF 2645 was passed, calling it \"a poorly written bill with sometimes-ambiguous language that raises troubling, unanswered questions and unresolved uncertainties for management, labor and taxpayers alike.\"", "In recent weeks the extent to which Judge and other Culver administration officials collaborated with lawmakers and labor leaders to improve the bill has been hotly debated.", "In an Iowa Public Television debate on May 26, Judge said she didn\u2019t \"believe there was a lot of back and forth on that particular piece of legislation\" and said she \"wished we could have worked more closely with labor.\"", "That led to a sharply worded retort from AFSCME Council 61, the state\u2019s main public employees\u2019 union: \"Patty Judge is not telling the truth about labor\u2019s engagement with her administration during this process,\" AFSCME President Danny Homan said.", "Then in a Des Moines Register/KCCI debate on Wednesday, Judge said she \"regretted\" how the bill was handled.", "\"I wish that we could go back and negotiate a good piece of legislation together,\" she said. \"But you know, we can\u2019t. We can\u2019t go backwards. We need to go\u00a0forwards.\"", "She followed that up by telling the Register that by the time the bill reached the governor, the opportunity for making constructive changes had passed.", "\"I regret that it had to be vetoed. That decision did not come lightly. There was a lot of thought, a lot of conversation that went into it,\" Judge said. \"But when a bill is sent to the governor\u2019s office, there is no option for changing it. You sign it or you don\u2019t sign it. While there was lots of conversation, there was really no opportunity for any sort of amending.\"", "Did the governor\u2019s office\u00a0have no opportunity to change the bill in a meaningful way after it was passed?", "The\u00a0history of HF 2645\u00a0provides the answer.", "The bill was\u00a0introduced on March 14. On March 19, it was debated on the House floor, where it faced dozens of proposed amendments before ultimately\u00a0passing on a 52-47 vote.", "It then went to the Senate, where it was considered on the floor on March 24. During a lengthy debate, more than 20 amendments were offered and rejected before the bill\u00a0passed on a 27 to 23 vote.", "At that point, things slowed down. Rather than sending the bill directly to the governor\u2019s office, Senate records show\u00a0Majority Leader Michael Gronstal, D-Council Bluffs, filed a motion to reconsider.", "That parliamentary maneuver freezes legislation in place and allows lawmakers to reopen debate \u2014 including, potentially, amending or rewriting the bill and sending it to the other chamber for further discussion.", "The motion to reconsider held HF 2645 in place for more than a month \u2014\u00a0until April 25, when Gronstal withdrew it\u00a0and began the process of sending the bill to Culver to be signed or vetoed.", "The bill reached Culver on May 5, and he vetoed it on May 15.", "Judge campaign manager Sam Roecker on Friday argued that the motion to reconsider didn't change the governor's office's ability to influence the bill.", "\"She has addressed the issue of the 2008 legislation and has said clearly she regrets the circumstances around which it was vetoed,\" Roecker said in a statement. \"However, regardless of a motion to reconsider, the governor\u2019s office does not have the power to introduce amendments to a bill before or after it\u2019s passed by the legislature.\"", "Our ruling", "Judge said there\u2019s no option for changing or amending a bill after it\u2019s \"sent to the governor\u2019s office.\" That\u2019s true, but it overlooks the month-long period in which this particular collective bargaining legislation was held under a motion to reconsider after it was passed by lawmakers.", "If legislators, the governor\u2019s office and other interested parties had found a new consensus on the bill\u2019s language sometime within that March 24 to April 25 window, the bill could have\u00a0been reconsidered by the Senate, amended, returned to the House and ultimately passed in the altered form.", "For this reason we rate Judge\u2019s assertions that there was \"no option for changing\" the bill\u00a0and \"no opportunity for any sort of amending\" Half True.", "Phone interview with Mike Marshall, Secretary of the Iowa Senate, June 3, 2016", "Email interview with Sam Roecker, Judge campaign manager, June 3, 2016", "Iowa Legislature Archive, House File 2645, accessed June 2-3, 2016", "Iowa Legislature Archive, Bill History for HF 2645, accessed June 2-3, 2016", "Iowa Legislature Archive, Gov.
