They\u2019re not ready to declare a lifelong love for a political party (or a spouse, for that matter). In Facebook lingo, they might say \"It\u2019s complicated\" or claim to be in an open relationship with political parties.", "\"They should call us the \u2018party pooper\u2019 generation,\" tweeted Rock the Vote, an organization focused on increasing young registered voters, on March 11, 2014. \"50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party.\"", "After hearing about the youth vote helping elect President Barack Obama, we wondered if that statistic could be correct: Do half of millennials not associate with a political party?", "Identification and voting aren\u2019t the same", "In the tweet, Rock the Vote linked to a study released by Pew Research Center in March. Pew conducted the telephone survey of 1,821 adults nationwide in February, including 617 millennials ages 18 to 33, and analyzed previous surveys.
