Fischer claimed that Obama was using the MH 17 downing as a platform to legitimize gay relationships.", "\"Obama politicizes deaths of AIDS researchers on Malaysian plane. We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men,\" Fischer said in a\u00a0message on Twitter\u00a0that was retweeted 66 times and attracted national attention.", "His comments were lambasted by writers of The Daily Beast, Salon and Patheos.

Also, he said that while his tweet isolated on men having sex with men, he made a somewhat broader argument on his radio show.", "\"We know how to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

If we can get everybody persuaded to do that, then the epidemic begins to diminish overnight.\"", "Dr. Stefan Baral, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiology professor and director of the Key Populations Program of the Center for Public Health and Human Rights, said Fischer\u2019s post on Twitter\u00a0reveals a misunderstanding about human nature and societal behavior.", "\"His recommendation is akin to making recommendations for people not to drive cars for fear of car accidents or riding a bike for fear of falling,\" Baral said in an email. \"In other words, this is a natural and healthy normal practice that in the context of an additional determinant induces risk.

About 35 million people have HIV in the world, including about 3.3 million children and 1 million Americans, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Among Americans, about 50,000 are newly infected each year, and 18 percent do not know they have the virus.", "In 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, which was a 30 percent drop from 2005, according to UNAIDS.", "In the United States, gay men contract the virus at disproportionate rates to their share of the American population. In 2010, men who have sex with men comprised 78 percent of new HIV infections among men -- 63 percent of all new infections -- even though they made up just 4 percent of the male American population, according to the CDC.", "Still, preventing men from having sex with men (if that were even feasible) will not end HIV/AIDS in the United States.\u00a0About 20 percent of Americans infected with HIV in 2010 were women, mainly through heterosexual sex, according to the CDC.", "HIV is carried through body fluids.

This region is also home to the most children living with HIV whose infections originated during pregnancy, childbirth of consuming breast milk, according to AIDS.gov.", "Globally, the dominant form of transmission is heterosexual sex, said Sophie Barton Knott, UNAIDS spokeswoman. Nearly half of people with HIV are female, and most were infected through heterosexual sex. Most of the 50.9 percent of men with HIV got it through heterosexual sex, too, she said.", "The highest rates of AIDS among 15- to 24-year-olds is among women in many parts of the world, said Seth Faison, spokesman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Being gay is a crime in at least 76 countries, and in those places, gay men are less likely to receive treatment, testing and prevention.", "The CDC also says stigma and homophobia are likely one factor behind the rise in HIV infections among young gay men in the United States.", "\"In effect, efforts to \u2018persuade men not to have sex with men\u2019 is counterproductive,\" Faison said. \"It will not stop AIDS.\"", "Our ruling", "Fischer said, \"We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men.\"", "Though men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in America, this is not a serious solution to ending a pandemic disease.
