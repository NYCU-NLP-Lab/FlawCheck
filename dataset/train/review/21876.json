Americans want a tax code that helps those in need, not just the rich.", "Republican Representative Kevin Brady of Texas acknowledged the plight of the California fire victims and promised to provide special tax relief similar to that which he secured for the victims of the 2017 hurricanes.", "Yet, he didn't back down from his support of the House tax bill:", "I am focused on securing funding for those impacted by this year\u2019s devastating storms and wildfires while also working to wrap up the most transformational tax reform bill in a generation.", "It remains to be seen what will become of the personal casualty deduction in the final version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, as of this writing, is still undergoing reconciliation in Congress.", "It is expected to be passed and signed into law by the end of 2017.", "O'Donnell, Noreen. \u00a0\"GOP's Tax Bill Could Eliminate Wildfire Tax Deduction as California Blazes Rage.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0NBC News. \u00a08 December 2017.", "Puzzanghera, Jim. \u00a0\"GOP Tax Bill Would End Deduction for Wildfire and Earthquake Victims - But Not Recent Hurricane Victims.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Los Angeles Times. \u00a07 November 2017.", "Feinstein.Senate.gov. \u00a0\"Feinstein, Harris: Republican Tax Plan Cruelly Eliminates Wildfire, Natural Disaster Deduction.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a08 November 2017.", "KevinBrady.House.gov. \u00a0\"Texas Delegation Secures $15 Billion in Disaster Funds in Emergency Funding Bill.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a012 October 2017.", "David Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
