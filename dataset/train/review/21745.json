When the duo tried to speed away, SI Akhand Upadhayay allegedly thrashed Singh with a baton and rendered him unconscious.", "Singh was later admitted to the hospital and sent home after recovery, per Dainik Bhaskar.

They were asked to stop during checking because they were riding without helmets. They first halted the bike but later tried to speed away. A constable held the bike from behind in order to stop it. This caused the bike to fall and the youth sustained injuries. He was later admitted to the hospital. The bike also did not have a number plate and the youth was inebriated. An investigation is underway. If any policeman is found guilty, necessary actions will be taken.\u201d (Translated from Hindi)", "A different version of SSP Verma\u2019s statement was given by Dainik Bhaskar. He said that the police investigation found the allegation of the use of a baton false and further added that the motorcycle toppled over on a speed breaker when the duo tried to flee. He also said that a medical examination later found the rider to be under the influence of alcohol.", "Yet another version was stated by the police on Twitter. In a reply to a user, UP police reiterated that the rider was drunk and he wasn\u2019t hit with a baton. The alleged newspaper clipping shared by the police, however, gave further details which do not match with the previous statements.
