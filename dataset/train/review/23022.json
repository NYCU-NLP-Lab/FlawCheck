We decided to take a closer look.", "The article was published at a site called NewsExaminer on July 10. It says that a pastor from Proctor, Vt., was sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. It came just days after the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that same-sex marriage would be allowed in all 50 states. (The ruling didn\u2019t legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont, which approved it on its own in 2009.)", "But the bottom line is that the NewsExaminer is a fake-news site, and has been classified as such by Snopes, the urban legends site. Through a posting to an NBC copycat website with the url www.nbc.com.co, the article gained traction through mistaken association with the genuine NBC News site.", "The article cites several individuals involved in the case, but none seem to exist.", "The Christian pastor who was sentenced, Paul Horner, is actually a recurring name used in stories published by the National Report and other fake news sites. According to Snopes.com, the character Paul Horner has been used in past articles about everything from the British street artist Banksy to a Dolphin mascot for a Christian organization.

Instead, the Pride Center of Vermont lists Kim Fountain as its executive director.", "We also couldn\u2019t find a record for the Vermont Family Research Committee or its purported president, Steve Shand.", "There is one element of the article that is accurate: The town of Proctor exists. It is a small town in Rutland County, Vt.,with a population of just under 2,000. It is, as the article accurately says, \"home to the Vermont Marble Museum, and the only marble bridge in America.\"", "However, the Christian Proctor Church is as fake as its pastor.
