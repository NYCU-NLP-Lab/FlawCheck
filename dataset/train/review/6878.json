We do not have a focus. There are over 200,000 social media tweets and posts per day by ISIS, in a very sophisticated social media campaign. They are acting at the speed of broadband while we are acting at the speed of bureaucracy.\"", "She added:", "\"We have 10,000 IRS agents making sure that you don't take an improper charity deduction and less than two dozen people focusing on countering violent extremism at home.

It is a generational conflict and we must lead now more than ever.\"", "McSally greatly understated what the IRS\u2019 10,000 revenue agents do.", "And to conclude there are only two dozen people who focus on countering violent extremism in the country, she defined that group very narrowly.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look.", "Checking charitable deductions", "On the IRS part of McSally\u2019s statement, her office asked the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service how many revenue agents the IRS has, according to emails forwarded to us by her staff. The IRS told the research service there were 10,840.", "A revenue agent, the research service told McSally, \"typically is an accountant who audits and examines the tax returns of individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt entities to determine whether they are meeting their tax obligations.\"", "In other words, the work of the 10,000 IRS agents is much broader than merely checking whether a taxpayer improperly claimed a tax deduction for making a charitable donation.", "It\u2019s also not necessarily surprising the number is as high as it is, given that millions of people and entities file federal income taxes. And only a federal agency, not state or local authorities, would be involved in auditing federal returns.", "That\u2019s in contrast to the approach taken in countering violent extremism.", "Countering violent extremism", "Now for the second part of McSally\u2019s claim -- that there are fewer than two dozen people \"focusing on countering violent extremism\" in America, which isn\u2019t exactly the same as fighting terrorism.", "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, citing a White House strategy document on countering violent extremism, says violent extremists are \"individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals.\"", "So, countering violent extremism is an effort to prevent such violence.", "We asked for more clarification from Amy Pate, research director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.

It\u2019s done through a variety of outreach and education programs, social media and other efforts, aiming to get down to the local and even the individual level -- such as showing parents how to spot whether a son or daughter might be becoming radicalized.", "\"The more local it is, the more successful it\u2019s going to be,\" Pate told us.", "Indeed, the White House strategy document, issued in 2011, outlines how the federal government will \"support and help empower American communities and their local partners in their grassroots efforts to prevent violent extremism.\"", "The White House also said, in February 2015, that \"communities provide the solution to violent extremism; and CVE efforts are best pursued at the local level, tailored to local dynamics, where local officials continue to build relationships within their communities through established community policing and community outreach mechanisms. The federal government\u2019s most effective role in strengthening community partnerships and preventing violent extremism is as a facilitator, convener, and source of research and findings.\"", "In other words, unlike auditing federal tax returns, which is done at the federal level, countering violent extremism has a federal component but is designed to be an effort that is spread out throughout the country.", "To back McSally\u2019s statement on the two dozen federal workers, her office cited a statement made at a July 2015 congressional hearing by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.
