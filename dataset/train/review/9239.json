Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.\"", "That wasn\u2019t the first time Trump hailed El Paso\u2019s barrier as a solution to crime. And it might not be the last: Trump plans to be in El Paso on Feb. 11 for a campaign rally.", "But the claim is not true.", "To start, El Paso has not been considered one of the nation\u2019s most dangerous cities. Its violent crime rate has been significantly below the national average compared to cities of similar size. Even more, the violent crime rate went up \u2014\u00a0not down, as Trump claimed \u2014 after the construction of a border fence in the region.", "An FBI tool allows users to view violent crime rates reported by police agencies, from 1985 to 2014.

It\u2019s possible that Trump echoed remarks from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.", "Paxton at a Jan. 10 border security roundtable told Trump that a barrier over 100 miles long was placed in El Paso, and then the crime rate became one of the lowest in the nation. \"I think it was under the Bush administration,\" Paxton told Trump.", "In a news release, Paxton\u2019s office later said he was talking about a 131-mile fence completed in 2010. Texas does have about 131 miles of pedestrian fencing. But not all of it is in El Paso, and it\u2019s been added over several periods.", "Former President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of barriers at the southwest border, including the El Paso region. About 42 miles of fencing were built in the El Paso Sector between August 2008 and July 2009, said a report from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "It\u2019s unclear which specific fencing finished in 2010, as Paxton\u2019s office said. Still, Trump\u2019s boast of an immediate crime drop doesn\u2019t hold up.", "In 2007, the year before fence construction started, El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate was 417.8 offenses per 100,000 population.

Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California-Irvine.", "Likewise, if the violent crime rate had gone down, it\u2019s improper to say it was just because of the fencing, she said.", "\"If you really want to make a conclusion in one direction or another, you have to do a study that isolates the impact of a wall on crime, controlling for other factors,\" Kubrin said.", "Empirical data suggests no significant difference in the average violent crime rate in border and non-border metropolitan areas, said a 2016 border security report from the Congressional Research Service.", "\"The specific impact of border enforcement on border-area crime is unknown, however, because available data cannot separate the influence of border enforcement from other factors,\" the report said.", "Trump said, \"The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2014 one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities.
