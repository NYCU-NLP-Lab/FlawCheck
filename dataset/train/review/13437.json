["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 4, 2020", "The falsehood that votes for President Donald Trump weren\u2019t counted in Arizona because the ballots were filled out with Sharpie pens spread widely on the day after the election. But the county where the claim originated actually recommends that voters use fine tip Sharpies to fill out their ballots.", "The word \u201cSharpie\u201d trended on Twitter as a bogus claim of voter fraud in Arizona spread online, while ballots in key states were counted following the Nov. 3 election.", "The claim appears to have begun with a viral video taken outside of a Maricopa County polling place on Election Day.", "The person recording the video is heard saying, \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re telling people to use the Sharpies, that way, those votes aren\u2019t counted\u2026 They\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re trying to skew all of the votes in there\u2026 So, people are coming here to vote for Donald Trump and those votes are all getting invalidated.\u201d", "But the video offers no evidence to support that claim. It shows one woman who repeats the same claim and another woman who appears to be hearing it for the first time.", "The person who posted the video on Facebook, Marko Trickovic, did not respond to our request for comment.", "County and state officials have been clear, though \u2014 all ballots will be counted.", "Secretary of State Katie Hobbs took to Twitter, saying: \u201cIMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!\u201d", "Hobbs also clarified on CNN, \u201cI want to validate voters who have concerns about their ballots being counted. There is no concern about ballots being counted because of the pen that was used to mark the ballots. All of those ballots are being counted. And even if the machines can\u2019t read them for some reason, a marker bled through to the other side, we have ways to count them. They\u2019re going to be counted. There is absolutely no merit to saying that this was some conspiracy to invalidate Republican ballots. It just \u2013 there is no there there at all.\u201d", "And, when it announced new voting equipment earlier this year, the Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s Office said polling places would use fine tip Sharpies \u201cbecause it\u2019s the fastest drying ink and works best on the tabulation equipment.\u201d", "The recorder\u2019s office reminded voters of that fact on Election Day, tweeting: \u201cDid you know we use Sharpies in the Vote Centers so the ink doesn\u2019t smudge as ballots are counted onsite? New offset columns on the ballots means bleed through won\u2019t impact your vote!\u201d", "Despite those facts, some conservative activists have promoted the bogus claim, suggesting that it applies to the entire state of Arizona.", "Not only is it false in Maricopa County, it\u2019s false in the rest of the state, too.", "Most counties in Arizona use voting machines manufactured by Election Systems & Software.", "Katina Granger, spokeswoman for the ES&S, told FactCheck.org by email that \u201cblack felt tip pens such as a Sharpie are fine\u201d with their machines.", "Sometimes, though, a felt tip pen can bleed through and darken a selection on the other side of the ballot, she explained about how the system generally works. In that case, \u201cthe machine would kick out the ballot for further review.\u201d", "Maricopa County, however,\u00a0has machines\u00a0that use\u00a0Dominion Voting Systems\u00a0software and ballots,\u00a0which prevent one side from bleeding through and darkening\u00a0a selection on the other side, Kay Stimson, spokeswoman for Dominion, explained in an email to FactCheck.org.", "\u201cElection officials are well-accustomed to dealing with ballots marked with different types of writing utensils,\u201d Stimson said. \u201cFine-tipped Sharpies have been found to provide the fastest-drying ink, which helps to prevent any smearing or stray marks on ballots being marked at the polls.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
