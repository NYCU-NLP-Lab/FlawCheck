The dispatcher checked to see if there were police cars where she was and there weren\u2019t, and he told her to keep driving, remain calm and that he had backup already on the way. Ten minutes later four cop cars surrounded her and the unmarked car behind her. One policeman went to her side and the others surrounded the car behind. They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the ground. The man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes.\"", "The post goes on to explain that 112 is an emergency number that \"applies in all 50 states\" and provides a \"direct link to state trooper info,\" then urges readers to spread the post to everyone as it \"may well save a life.\"", "This post, shared by more than 2.9 million people so far, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But 112 is an emergency number in some other countries, according to the U.S. Department of State, including Austria, Denmark, and the Canary Islands.", "In response to this warning spreading on social media, a Fox News affiliate in Milwaukee, Wis., in 2013 consulted the local sheriff\u2019s department about the post\u2019s claims and an NBC affiliate in Charlotte, N.C., in 2017, did the same with its local law enforcement. In both cases, law enforcement told the news outlets that while dialing 112 in the United States can sometimes redirect callers to 911, it does not result in any special handling of one\u2019s emergency call. A sergeant told Fox that because several wireless carriers sell cell phones in both the United States and overseas, they convert the emergency number dialed to the appropriate local emergency number.
