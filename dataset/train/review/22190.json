["Multiple Facebook posts, for example here\u00a0and here, claim that Marcos was the original author of Senate Bill 1304 or the \u201cFree Higher Education Act for All\u201d.", "The bill, which was signed into law in August 2017, aims to provide students from state colleges and universities with free education.", "Here is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:", "The status, when translated to English, says:", "\"For everyone's information:", "\"Bam Aquino is not the author of the 'Free Higher Education For All Act'. The original author of the BILL is Bongbong Marcos. It's just that scrap food is really a credit grabber.\"", "\u201cBam Aquino\u201d refers to Sen. Paolo Benigno Aquino IV,\u00a0nephew of the late senator Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr. and a member of Liberal party, the main opposition in the Philippines.", "He is sometimes called 'scrap food' because he filed a bill mandating that food-related\u00a0businesses\u00a0must give their spare food to food banks.", "According to the copy of Senate Bill 1304 posted on the Senate\u2019s online legislative archives, Marcos is not one of the authors of the free education bill.", "Here is a screenshot of the bill\u2019s authors:", "The authors listed when it was filed on January 23, 2017, were Senators Recto, Villanueva, Ejercito, Aquino IV, Gatchalian, Pangilinan, \u00a0Angara and Legarda.", "The timeline of the bill\u2019s passage into law posted on the official government website shows that other senators were made co-authors.", "All in all, the bill had 12 authors: senators Ralph Recto, Joel Villanueva, Joseph Victor Ejercito, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, Sherwin Gatchalian, Francis Pangilinan, Juan Edgardo \u201cSonny\u201d Angara, Loren Legarda, Leila de Lima, Cynthia Villar, Juan Miguel Zubiri and Richard Gordon.", "The timeline also specified the separate bills which had been filed by each senator as part of the push for free education in state colleges and universities, none of which were authored by Marcos.", "These are Senate bill no. 61, Senate bill no. 158, Senate bill no. 173, Senate bill no. 177, Senate bill no. 198, Senate bill 962 and Senate bill 1220.", "Senate bill 1304 was filed on January 23, 2017 and was signed into law on August 15, 2017.", "Marcos, the son and namesake of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos,\u00a0served as senator from July 2010 to June 2016.
