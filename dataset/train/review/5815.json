["About this rating", "A photograph purportedly showing a 30-foot wave crashing down on Jennette's Pier in Nags Head, North Carolina was circulated on social media in September 2017 as Hurricane Jose approached the east coast of the United States:", "This is not a genuine photograph. This image was created by photographer Alex Lex, and a faint watermark can be spotted in the upper-right corner of the image (circled in red in the image below). Although Lex presented this image as if it were genuine when he posted it to his Facebook page, this image has been manipulated.", "This image may appear authentic at first glance, but a closer inspection revealed one glaring error: A calm horizon line can still be seen beneath the pier. If this wave truly was crashing down on Jennette's Pier, it would be impossible to see the horizon (as it would require the waves to the left of the pier to be invisible):", "Furthermore, the \"30-foot\" wave shown in this image was actually taken from a second photograph. Ferenc Sohajda took the original wave photograph, which he uploaded to Flickr in 2010, saying he captured the image off the coast of India.", "Here's a comparison of the fake Jennette's Pier photograph (left) and the original wave photograph (right):", "Hurricane Jose -- The worst of the storm is brushing past the Outer Banks and we're experiencing high winds, waves and ocean over wash in several places along N.C. 12 in Nags Head. Ocean waves are not, however, crashing over the end of the pier as portrayed on social media by a local photographer. We hope the ESA Championships will restart this week as soon as things calm down.", "Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
