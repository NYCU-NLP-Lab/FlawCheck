Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans.", "\"This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories, by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.", "\"We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!", "\"Most Americans believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.", "\"If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.", "We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.", "\"This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this.

So accept the country that accepted you.\"", "The text was a near-verbatim reproduction of a previous rumor, which we rated as \"Misattributed\" in October 2001.
