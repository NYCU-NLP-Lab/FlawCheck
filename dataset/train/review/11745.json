["By Sean Carlin", "Posted on March 10, 2020", "Corona\u2019s parent company reports that its beer sales in the U.S. are up this year, contrary to viral Facebook posts that falsely claim its U.S. sales have dropped because of the new coronavirus.", "Corona beer\u2019s public relations team doesn\u2019t want its brand associated with an epidemic, but viral Facebook posts are falsely stating that beer drinkers are shunning Corona as a result of the new coronavirus.", "The posts take a shot at the intelligence of the public, claiming that \u201cthe fact that Corona Beer is experiencing a profit loss shows you that there is a problem with the IQ level of the general population.\u201d", "But Constellation Brands, Corona\u2019s producer, says its U.S. sales are up in the early part of the year and the company doesn\u2019t have much exposure to international markets, such as China, which have suffered a greater impact from the disease.", "Corona Extra sales grew 5% in the U.S. in the latest four-week period, which ended Feb. 16 \u2014 \u201cnearly doubling the 52-week trend for the brand,\u201d the company said. The company\u2019s sales are primarily focused on the U.S. market, according to a statement from Constellation Brands. Only 2.7% of the company\u2019s $8.1 billion in sales of all its products were outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2019.", "Misinformation about the beer was fueled by a survey that claimed some beer drinkers stopped buying Corona beer because of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The survey about the Mexican-based lager was released Feb. 27 by 5W Public Relations and picked up by several news outlets.", "The New York-based public relations firm said it conducted phone interviews with 737 beer drinkers in the U.S. and found that 38% \u201cwould not buy Corona under any circumstances.\u201d But the company did not publicize the survey questions or state why more than a third of those surveyed would not buy the beer. The percentage of regular Corona drinkers who said they wouldn\u2019t buy the beer was much smaller.", "\u201cAmong those who said they usually drink Corona, only 4% said they would stop drinking Corona,\u201d the firm said, \u201cbut 14% said they wouldn\u2019t order Corona in a public venue.\u201d", "It also claimed that 16% of those surveyed were confused about whether the beer was related to coronavirus, which has spread to more than 700 people in the U.S. and killed more than 20.", "The two names do share the common Latin root corona, which refers to a halo or crown. The beer reportedly derives its name\u00a0and logo from the crown that adorns the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the town of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The name of the disease refers to the crown-like spikes seen through a microscope on the surface of the virus.", "\u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfortunate that recent misinformation about the impact of this virus on our business has been circulating in traditional and social media without further investigation or validation,\u201d Bill Newlands, president and chief executive officer at Constellation Brands, said in the company statement. \u201cThese claims simply do not reflect our business performance and consumer sentiment, which includes feedback from our distributor and retailer partners across the country. We\u2019ve seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
