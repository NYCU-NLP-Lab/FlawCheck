Seven and t--.\"", "Perhaps he was starting to say twenty-five, or some figure in the twenties.", "At that moment, there\u2019s a response from the audience, Ryan looks to the audience and correctly says: $7.25.", "So, if Ryan didn\u2019t know the rate exactly at that moment, he certainly was in the ballpark.", "Wisconsin\u2019s $7.25, by the way, is the same as the federal minimum wage, both of which have been in place since 2009.", "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of July 1, 2017, Wisconsin and Iowa were among 14 states with a minimum wage at $7.25 per hour.
