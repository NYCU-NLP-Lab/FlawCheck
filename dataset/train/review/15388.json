We are setting all time records with the economy!\u201d Trump wrote early on January 15 in a comment accompanying the retweet, which has been \u201cliked\u201d more than 70,000 times.", "The four-second clip that Trump retweeted was posted by Sarah Dolan Schneider, the executive director\u00a0of the conservative America Rising PAC, the previous night.", "The clip is cut to show billionaire California activist Steyer saying: \u201cDemocrats are gonna destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.\u201d", "However, Steyer\u2019s full quote, which can be viewed below starting at the 18:19 minute mark, makes clear that is not his position.", "In the Iowa debate, Steyer said: \u201cWe know how Donald Trump is gonna run for president.
