When it comes to student misconduct in our fraternities and sororities, the time to act is now.\"", "Later in his letter, Gee wrote that following a student death in 2014, \"we have had great success in changing our overall student culture to emphasize working smart and playing smart. The result has been a rise in student academic qualifications. Last fall, for example, on our Morgantown campus we welcomed our biggest class of Honors College freshmen ever, as well as our largest overall freshman class, with the highest-ever GPA.\"", "Friction between the university and fraternities has continued: Several fraternities threatened to bolt from university oversight, and during the first week of the semester in August, Gee sent a letter to parents asking them to \"discourage\" students from rushing unaffiliated fraternities.", "In this article, we aren\u2019t going to fact-check the fraternity controversy, but one portion of Gee\u2019s earlier letter caught our eye.

The incoming freshman GPA is the highest since 1995, according to data provided by the university, and given the steady rise since 1995, it\u2019s plausible that the current class\u2019 GPA is the highest in the university\u2019s history.
