["By Brooks Jackson", "Posted on June 9, 2016", "Political attack ads all too often try to spin an opponent\u2019s jaywalking tickets into felonies. As an example, consider Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes\u2019 claim that his GOP primary opponent, Scott Taylor, \u201cviolated federal election law 19 times.\u201d", "The claim results from overreaching by opposition researchers. The fact is, the Federal Election Commission has cited Taylor\u2019s 2010 campaign committee for one and only one violation, for which the fine was $0.", "The other 18 \u201cviolations\u201d were actually automatic \u201crequest for additional information\u201d notices that the FEC staff continued to send to the defunct Taylor campaign committee for years, seeking additional reports and saying that the campaign \u201cmay\u201d be violating reporting requirements. But the FEC finally decided in 2015 to let the matter drop without initiating any further enforcement action.", "The Forbes campaign has repeated this claim of 19 \u201cviolations\u201d again and again. It appears on a Forbes website devoted to attacking Taylor as a \u201crule breaker\u201d who isn\u2019t fit for office. And it appeared in a companion TV spot that first aired last month.", "Where does the Forbes campaign come up with the other 18 \u201cviolations?\u201d Here\u2019s what really happened:", "In 2010, Taylor \u2014 a former Navy Seal sniper and a member of the Virginia House of Delegates \u2014 ran and lost a bid for the GOP nomination for Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District U.S. House seat.\u00a0 Afterward, the campaign filed a routine financial report with the FEC showing that it had raised a total of nearly $42,000, had no outstanding debts or bills, and still had a little over $21,000 in the bank.", "But the next quarterly report deadline came and passed with no other report from Taylor. Even an inactive committee of a defeated candidate must continue to report what they do with any leftover money, so the FEC found \u201creason to believe\u201d that Taylor\u2019s committee (and several others) had violated reporting requirements. For Taylor\u2019s committee, the FEC staff proposed an administrative fine of $990. The Taylor campaign was asked to respond.", "That matter was resolved a few months later, after the Taylor campaign filed a tardy \u201ctermination\u201d report stating that it hadn\u2019t raised or spent any money since the previous report. The FEC sent a letter, dated April 29, 2011, stating a \u201cfinal determination\u201d that the campaign committee (but not Taylor himself, technically) and the committee\u2019s treasurer had violated the reporting requirements of the federal campaign law. The commissioners voted to close the file without assessing any fine.", "Unfortunately for Taylor, his \u201ctermination\u201d report showed that the campaign had a cash balance of $34,281.72, which had somehow increased from the $21,127.64 cash balance shown on the previous report, even though no new donations or expenditures were noted.", "Whatever the amount of leftover cash, campaign committees can\u2019t properly be terminated until accounts are zeroed out. So an FEC analyst sent the campaign a letter stating, \u201cit appears that you have not yet met the requirements for terminating your committee,\u201d and adding that the campaign \u201cmust submit a statement explaining how it plans to dispose of residual funds.\u201d", "Taylor\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond. And for years thereafter, like clockwork every three months, the FEC staff sent \u201cRFAI Failure to File\u201d notices. In the FEC\u2019s bureaucratese, \u201cRFAI\u201d stands for \u201cRequest for Additional Information.\u201d The FEC states that an RFAI \u201caffords the committee/filer an opportunity to correct or clarify the public record, if necessary.\u201d", "So these are not official findings of a violation, which only the FEC commissioners themselves may make after formal proceedings. The staff-generated notices said \u201cyou may have failed to file\u201d a required report, which \u201cmay\u201d result in penalties. We stress, \u201cmay.\u201d", "Why didn\u2019t the Taylor campaign respond and clear up the matter? When we asked the current campaign manager Scott Weldon about this, he said the FEC kept sending its notices to a mailbox that the 2010 campaign ceased using after filing its \u201ctermination.\u201d That\u2019s plausible. The address was 2100 Mediterranean Avenue #247, and that was the address of a \u201cMail Depot\u201d location, where mailboxes could be rented.", "The FEC finally gave up a year ago. On June 11, 2015, an FEC staffer sent a letter to the old Taylor campaign treasurer stating that \u201cthe Commission intends to administratively terminate your committee.\u201d The letter added, \u201cAs such, your committee is no longer obligated to file reports.\u201d", "We\u2019ll note briefly here that this is only one example of \u201copposition overreach\u201d by the Forbes campaign.", "Virginia voters go to the polls June 14. Forbes has represented the neighboring 4th Congressional District since 2001, but is switching districts to run in the 2nd District this year because a court-ordered change in his old district made it more competitive for a Democrat. The 2nd Congressional District\u00a0incumbent Rep. Scott Rigell, who beat Taylor in the 2010 primary and went on to win the general election, is retiring after three terms in office.", "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/825f4f63-4605-4192-b2f0-8f8998082002", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
