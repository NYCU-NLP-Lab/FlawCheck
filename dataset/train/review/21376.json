Joe Kennedy, a supporter of the bill, Crenshaw said HR1 would legalize the \"kind of fraud\" found in North Carolina.", "\"You do realize your bill\u00a0#HR1\u00a0would actually make that kind of fraud in\u00a0#NC09\u00a0LEGAL. Right? TRUTH: it would legalize vote harvesting across the entire country, use your tax $ to do it, and limit free speech drastically,\" Crenshaw tweeted.", "The terms \"vote harvesting\" and \"ballot harvesting\" typically refer to political operatives tracking down and collecting absentee ballots from voters. Many states have strict laws limiting who can file ballots on behalf of absentee voters. In those states, ballot harvesting is illegal.", "So is Crenshaw right? Would HR 1 \"legalize\" ballot harvesting across the country?", "A PolitiFact review of the bill found dozens of mentions of absentee ballots \u2014 but none of the proposed law changes would absolve North Carolina\u2019s political operatives of wrongdoing.", "WHAT HAPPENED IN NC", "Republican Mark Harris appeared to beat Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes.

About 30 minutes later, Crenshaw\u00a0tweeted a clarification.", "\"Worth clarifying: HR1 enables ballot harvesting via mandatory no-fault absentee ballots and by not outlawing the practice of ballot harvesting.

But whether or not it is fair to call the financing provisions taxpayer funded, that has nothing to do with the so-called \u2018ballot harvesting\u2019 issue.\"", "OUR RULING", "Crenshaw said HR 1 would legalize the \"kind of fraud\" found in NC\u2019s 9th district. There\u2019s nothing in the bill that expands who can collect absentee ballots, allows people to fill out ballots for others, or loosens witnessing procedures for absentee ballots.", "Crenshaw then clarified his original tweet to say \"no excuse\" absentee voting enables ballot harvesting. The second tweet also suggested that banning ballot harvesting would\u2019ve prevented fraud in North Carolina. That\u2019s not true. And his arguments do nothing to substantiate his original tweet.
