["By Vanessa Schipani", "Posted on June 1, 2018", "Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke claimed the Navajo people who \u201clive close\u201d to Bears Ears National Monument \u201cwere all in support\u201d of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to shrink the protected land.\u00a0But tribe representatives told us that\u2019s false.", "In fact, the Navajo Nation and other indigenous tribes have\u00a0sued the federal government over the president\u2019s decision.", "National monuments \u201care areas reserved by the National Government because they contain objects of historic, prehistoric, or scientific interest,\u201d explains the National Park Service. This is different from a national park, which is designated because it has \u201csome outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena,\u201d NPS adds.", "In December 2016, President Barack Obama created the Bears Ears National Monument, declaring 1.35 million acres in Southeast Utah protected under the Antiquities Act\u00a0of 1906. About a year later, Trump split the monument into two units \u2014\u00a0the Shash Jaa\u2019 unit and the Indian Creek unit. Together, they make up about\u00a0201,876 acres, which is over 6.5 times smaller than Obama\u2019s designation.", "Zinke made his claim on the radio program \u201cBreitbart News Daily\u201d in an interview with Breitbart\u2019s editor in chief, Alex Marlow\u00a0(at about the 8:20 mark). He pointed specifically to the Shash Jaa\u2019 unit, which is closer to the Navajo reservation.", "Zinke, May 28: The Navajo tribes that actually live close to Bears Ears, now the Shash Jaa\u2019, were all in support of the president\u2019s action.", "When we contacted the Interior Department for support for Zinke\u2019s claim, spokeswoman Heather Swift clarified that Zinke was speaking specifically about the \u201cUtah Navajo.\u201d", "But\u00a0James Adakai, the president of Oljato Navajo Chapter in Utah, told us via email that Zinke\u2019s claim is \u201ctotally\u00a0incorrect and misleading.\u201d\u00a0He explained that there are seven chapters with a good chuck of their territory in the state\u00a0\u2014 Oljato, Navajo Mountain,\u00a0Aneth, Dennehotso, Mexican Water, Red Mesa and Teec Nos Pos.\u00a0Out of those seven chapters, six \u201csupported President Obama\u2019s Bears Ears Proclamation for 1.35 million acres,\u201d he said, with the Aneth Chapter being the only one that originally didn\u2019t.", "Adakai added that the\u00a0Navajo Utah Commission,\u00a0which consists of the seven elected Utah Navajo chapter presidents and council members of those chapters, sent Zinke a request to \u201cuphold the Bears Ears National Monument Designation\u201d in May 2017.", "Gavin Noyes, the executive director of\u00a0Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah, a nonprofit that helps indigenous communities protect their lands, similarly told us that Zinke\u2019s claim is \u201cfalse.\u201d", "Noyes sent us a map (see left)\u00a0that shows the territories of the Navajo chapters in Utah. It shows that in 2017, 163 members of the tribe voted in favor of the monument, while three opposed it and 12 abstained. This includes members of two additional Navajo chapters \u2014 the Inscription House and Sweetwater chapters \u2014 that border or have a minority of their territory in Utah.", "The Aneth Chapter didn\u2019t hold a vote at all, as the map shows. \u201cThe Aneth Chapter refused to allow a vote to proceed (perhaps because its citizens and Chapter President now support the Obama monument),\u201d said Noyes. Adakai confirmed this was the case.", "However,\u00a0Alastair Bits\u00f3\u00ed,\u00a0the communications director for the Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah, clarified over the phone that the majority of the Navajo who live within these chapters\u2019 territories didn\u2019t vote in 2017. Still, he said, more Utah Navajo support Bears Ears than don\u2019t.", "In fact, \u201cthe Navajos in Utah first led the fight to get the area protected, after there were\u00a0raids in 2009,\u201d Adakai added.\u00a0In June 2009, federal agents arrested a number of residents of Blanding, Utah, who had \u201callegedly looted artifacts such as pipes, jewelry, stone knives and woven sandals and sold them to an undercover informant,\u201d reported the Denver Post at the time.", "Adakai told us that\u00a0\u201cthis movement\u201d by Utah Navajos to get the area protected \u201ceventually lead to the Bears Ears Coalition,\u201d of which he is a member. In July 2015, leaders from the Navajo Nation and other\u00a0indigenous tribes formed the coalition with the aim of conserving Bears Ears.", "The coalition not only\u00a0condemned Trump\u2019s decision to shrink the monument,\u00a0but its member tribes also have filed a lawsuit, claiming the decision wasn\u2019t legal.", "Swift, the DOI spokeswoman, also pointed us to sources that show\u00a0Rebecca Benally, the commissioner for Utah\u2019s San Juan County and a member of the Navajo Nation\u2019s Aneth Chapter,\u00a0opposed\u00a0the initial creation of the monument and\u00a0supported\u00a0Trump\u2019s decision to shrink it. We reached out to Benally for comment, but she hasn\u2019t responded.", "Overall, there does appear to be some disagreement among members of the Navajo Nation living in the chapter territories near Bears Ears, but it\u2019s not true that \u201call\u201d support Trump\u2019s decision to shrink the monument, as Zinke claimed.", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
