But here are several AP images that clearly show the spine right-side up.", "In the following images, perhaps the most iconic ones taken of the event, it is a little harder to read the spine, but the free end of the ribbon bookmark clearly dangles below the Bible, which is how it was when the Bible was oriented correctly in the other images.", "We also reviewed the video of the event and confirmed that Trump consistently held the Bible right-side up.
