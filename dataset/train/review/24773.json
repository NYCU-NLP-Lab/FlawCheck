We\u2019ve debunked dozens and dozens of inaccurate claims about COVID-19 since the first case was reported in China in December 2019. That misinformation has included social media posts about how the coronavirus was man-made, engineered in a lab, or just a hoax.", "Another allegation that is also wrong: that the pandemic is a simulation.", "\"This whole COVID thing?\" one Facebook post said. \"It\u2019s a SIMULATION. In September 2019 - the WHO put out a paper that all countries AGREED to do. That\u2019s how they got the ENTIRE world to lock down at the SAME TIME.

The point of the exercise was to test plans and procedures, and identify problems that could occur in an actual pandemic \u2014\u00a0like the one we\u2019re experiencing now.", "WHO has also developed a simulation exercise for COVID-19 \"to support countries\u2019 preparedness effort\" during the outbreak, according to the organization.

By Jan. 18 it was using this test on samples from people with suspected cases of COVID-19.", "A few days later, the CDC used a sample from the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States to start growing the virus.
