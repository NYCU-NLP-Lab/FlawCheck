["About this rating", "A few days after President Trump inadvertently used the non-word \"covfefe\" in a tweet complaining about the media, the web site USPOLN published an article saying that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer had claimed that Trump had the authority to alter the spellings of words. Published on 2 June 2017, the item read:", "White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer drew widespread laughter from reporters when he insisted that President Donald Trump\u2019s infamous \u201ccovfefe\u201d tweet was not a misspelling. After one reporter asked Spicer if \u201cpeople should be concerned that the president posted somewhat of an incoherent tweet last night,\u201d Spicer simply replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The reporter then asked Spicer why the misspelled tweet stayed up for so long. \u201cThe president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,\u201d Spicer replied, which elicited laughter throughout the room. Reporters then tried to ask Spicer what \u201ccovfefe\u201d actually means, but he quickly moved on to another question ... The press secretary then turned to defending the president\u2019s tweet. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much this is all playing into Donald Trump\u2019s hand, this is exactly what he\u2019s after. He\u2019s that smart, believe me[.\"]", "\u201cMy point is \u2013 it\u2019s beyond whether or not it happened intentionally. Many of you may not like it, but the fact is that Donald Trump is the head of state and as such, it is within his legal right and power to decide how words in the English language are spelled, written, conjugated and all that good stuff ... Because, that\u2019s just one of the many perks of being President of the United States. It comes with the territory and it\u2019s up to you to decide whether or not you want to use it,\u201d Spicer concluded.", "Spicer made no such claim about \"covfeve,\" as USPOLN was a fake news site whose disclaimer explained:", "DISCLAIMER: USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. These Articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.", "Spicer's actual response to questions about the mistyped word did draw widespread media attention, however. The Boston Globe reported:", "\u201cDo you think people should be concerned that the president posted somewhat of an incoherent tweet last night and that it then stayed up for hours?\u201d a reporter asked Spicer, according to audio of the briefing.", "\u201cUm, no,\u201d Spicer replied.", "\u201cWhy did it stay up so long? Is no one watching this?\u201d the reporter pressed.", "\u201cI think the president and a small group of people knew exactly what he meant,\u201d Spicer replied.", "However, it is clear that the President simply mistyped the word \"coverage.\"", "Kim LaCapria is a former writer for Snopes.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
