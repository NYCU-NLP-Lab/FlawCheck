["By D'Angelo Gore, Lori Robertson, Eugene Kiely and Robert Farley", "Posted on May 23, 2019", "Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke twisted the facts on several topics, including immigration and gun control, during a CNN town hall.", "The town hall aired on May 21. O\u2019Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas, spoke to a crowd at\u00a0Drake University in Iowa.", "In discussing the current situation at the southwest border, O\u2019Rourke twice said that Trump either wants or is proposing to \u201cbuild a 2,000-mile wall.\u201d", "O\u2019Rourke:\u00a0And then let\u2019s focus more of our attention on our own hemisphere. Those people to whom we are connected by land, by culture, and increasingly by families, if we invest in solutions in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, then fewer people have to flee those countries and come to our border at the United States-Mexico border, where we\u2019re proposing to build a 2,000-mile wall right now.", "He later repeated his claim about \u201ca 2,000-mile wall.\u201d", "O\u2019Rourke:\u00a0But, Dana, that can\u2019t be the solution in and of itself. We need to invest in solutions in the northern triangle. This president wants to cut $500 million \u2014 that\u2019s all that we give to those three countries \u2014 and if you put it into perspective, he wants to spend $30 billion on a 2,000-mile wall. He wants to cut that. I would double it.", "We don\u2019t know what the president \u201cwants.\u201d But he has not proposed a 2,000-mile wall, and, in fact, he has said that there is no need to erect barriers the entire length of the border because of natural barriers, such as rivers and mountains.", "It is true that during the 2016 campaign Trump\u00a0promised\u00a0he would build \u201ca great, great wall on our southern border.\u201d He provided no specific construction plan during the campaign. His\u00a0immigration plan\u00a0simply said, \u201cThere must be a wall across the southern border.\u201d And, of course, \u201cMexico must pay for the wall.\u201d", "Once elected, Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0that directed the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to \u201ctake all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border.\u201d", "The\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an agency within DHS, developed a 10-year,\u00a0$18 billion plan, which it submitted on Jan. 5, 2018, to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The plan \u201cidentified approximately $18 billion in funding needs over a 10-year period for 722 miles of \u2018border wall system,\u2019 including \u2018316 miles of new primary wall and 407 miles of replacement and secondary wall,\u2019\u201d according to a\u00a0committee report.", "In a\u00a0July 2018 report, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0said it reviewed the CBP\u2019s \u201cImpedance and Denial Prioritization Strategy,\u201d which the GAO said \u201cincluded an overall estimate of the cost to construct barriers at Border Patrol\u2019s top 17 priority locations \u2014 an estimate of $18 billion for 722 miles of barriers.\u201d", "The GAO report also said: \u201cFrom fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2015, CBP increased the total miles of primary barriers on the southwest border from 119 miles to 654 miles \u2014 including 354 miles of primary pedestrian barriers and 300 miles of primary vehicle barriers.\u201d", "If the administration does add 316 miles of new primary barriers to the existing 654 miles of primary barriers, then there would be about 970 miles of primary barriers \u2014 roughly half the 2,000-mile southern border.", "During the partial government shutdown, which was spurred by the president\u2019s demand for border security funding, Trump\u00a0addressed\u00a0the nation on Jan. 19. In his remarks, Trump said he was asking Congress for $5.7 billion in fiscal year 2019 toward construction of what he called \u201ca strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall.\u201d", "The president said that there was no need to build \u201ca 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.\u201d He said, \u201cMuch of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.\u201d", "A year earlier, the president\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0something similar.", "Trump, Jan. 11, 2018:\u00a0The other thing \u2026 so the wall. The wall\u2019s never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas \u2026", "But, you don\u2019t need a wall where you have a natural barrier that\u2019s far greater than any wall you could build, OK? Because somebody said oh, he\u2019s going to make the wall smaller. I\u2019m not going to make it smaller. The wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it.", "Carlos Diaz, a CBP spokesman, provided us with a \u201cborder wall status\u201d fact sheet dated May 23 that said: \u201cSince\u00a0January 2017, approximately 205 miles of new and updated border barriers have been funded through the traditional appropriations process and via Treasury Forfeiture Funding, of which approximately 42 miles have been completed to date.\u201d", "CBP has identified $6.1 billion over the last three fiscal years to fund 336 miles of new and replacement barriers, according to the agency\u2019s fact sheet.", "We don\u2019t know what Trump plans to do at the border after fiscal year 2019, and CBP declined to say. \u201cAll that we can discuss at this point is what we\u2019ve been funded by Congress,\u201d Diaz said.", "But what we do know is that Trump has not proposed \u201cto build a 2,000-mile wall,\u201d as O\u2019Rourke said.", "O\u2019Rourke claimed that President Donald Trump had described \u201casylum-seekers as animals or an infestation,\u201d but the president has used those words to describe MS-13 gang members.", "Trump has used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d to describe members of the\u00a0caravan\u00a0and\u00a0all immigrants\u00a0who cross the border illegally.", "O\u2019Rourke: This president, this administration, his policies here at home and abroad have been an absolute disaster.\u00a0Describing those immigrants who come to this country as rapists and criminals, though they commit crimes at a far lower rate than those who are born in this country,\u00a0describing asylum-seekers as animals or an infestation\u00a0\u2014 an infestation is how you might describe a termite or a cockroach, something that you want to stamp out, something less than human \u2014 you don\u2019t get kids in cages at the border until you have dehumanized them in the eyes of your fellow Americans.", "Trump has a history of using the word \u201canimals\u201d in reference to MS-13 members.\u00a0At a July 25, 2017, rally in Ohio, Trump\u00a0said MS-13 gang members were \u201canimals\u201d who \u201cslice\u201d and \u201cdice\u201d young girls because they want their victims \u201cto go through excruciating pain.\u201d Three days later in New York, Trump\u00a0again said of the gang members, \u201cThese are animals.\u201d", "In May 2018, there was some controversy when the president said at a White House roundtable discussion with California political and law enforcement leaders: \u201cWe have people coming into the country, or trying to come in \u2014 and we\u2019re stopping a lot of them \u2014 but we\u2019re taking people out of the country. You wouldn\u2019t believe how bad these people are. These aren\u2019t people. These are animals.\u201d", "Some\u00a0news\u00a0coverage said Trump referred to some immigrants as \u201canimals,\u201d while other reports said he was talking about immigrant gang members, which had been mentioned by the Fresno County sheriff before Trump made his comments. Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u00a0criticized Trump for saying \u201cundocumented immigrants\u201d were \u201canimals.\u201d", "But Trump, and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, then clarified his remarks. Trump said,\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m referring, and you know I\u2019m referring, to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in.\u201d", "We wrote of the controversy then that we couldn\u2019t say what\u00a0Trump meant when he made his remarks, but the president had a history of using the term \u201canimals\u201d for gang members. Plus, at this point, Trump has clarified the remark.", "Similarly, Trump\u2019s use of the words \u201cinfest\u201d and \u201cinfestation\u201d has been in comments mentioning MS-13. He said in a June 19, 2018, tweet that Democrats \u201cwant illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13.\u201d A few weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cWhen we have an \u2018infestation\u2019 of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE!\u201d", "As we have written before, the MS-13 gang formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s. The Justice Department said there were \u201cmore than 10,000 members\u201d in 2017, but the FBI has been using that 10,000 estimate since at least 2006.", "O\u2019Rourke said Trump attempted to \u201cban all Muslims\u201d from entering the United States. As a presidential candidate, Trump proposed such a ban. As president, he didn\u2019t go that far.", "O\u2019Rourke:\u00a0To try to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, every tradition of faith, every walk of life.", "Trump did call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign. That was shortly after a Muslim couple\u00a0killed 14 people\u00a0in San Bernardino, California. The husband, Syed Farook, was born in America, but his wife, Tashfeen Malik, came to the U.S. from Pakistan in July 2014 on a K-1 fiancee visa.", "Trump issued a \u201cStatement on Preventing Muslim Immigration,\u201d which he\u00a0read\u00a0at a Dec. 7, 2015, rally. Trump called for a \u201ccomplete shutdown \u2026 until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice.\u201d", "However, Trump\u2019s executive actions as president did not go that far.", "On June 26, 2018, the Supreme Court\u00a0ruled 5-4\u00a0that the president had \u201clawfully exercised the broad discretion granted to him\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict entry to some foreign nationals in order to protect the interests of the United States. That ruling concerned a\u00a0presidential proclamation\u00a0that Trump signed in September 2017 \u2014 the third version of the administration\u2019s travel restrictions \u2014 which denied U.S. travel visas to certain nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela.", "The first five countries are\u00a0majority Muslim nations, but that\u2019s not a ban on all Muslims.", "In fact, in January 2017, the Pew Research Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0that Trump\u2019s original executive order \u2014 which also included travel restrictions for Iraqi and Sudanese nationals \u2014 would affect only about 12 percent of the world\u2019s Muslim population.", "O\u2019Rourke said he was told by \u201can expert\u201d that African Americans make up \u201c40 percent of the incarcerated population\u201d in Iowa. We didn\u2019t find support for a figure that high.", "O\u2019Rourke:\u00a0I was talking to somebody in Iowa, Tavis Hall, who is an expert on this. He said African Americans comprise 3 percent of Iowa\u2019s population, 40 percent of the incarcerated population in this state.", "African Americans are just 3.8 percent of Iowa\u2019s population,\u00a0according to\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau estimates as of July 2018. It\u2019s also true that African Americans are overrepresented in Iowa\u2019s prisons and jails, although they don\u2019t make up two-fifths of the state\u2019s incarcerated population, according to the estimates we reviewed.", "In 2014, the nonprofit\u00a0Prison Policy Initiative, which produces research on mass incarceration,\u00a0reported\u00a0\u2014 based on data from the 2010 Census \u2014 that\u00a0African Americans made up 3 percent of Iowa\u2019s total population and 23 percent of its prison and jail population. A senior policy analyst for PPI told us the organization plans to update those figures in 2021, after the 2020 Census data becomes available.", "In addition, the\u00a0Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit that works to \u201cimprove justice systems,\u201d\u00a0estimates that, in 2015, African Americans made up 25.2 percent of Iowa\u2019s state prison population and 23 percent of the population in jails statewide.", "The Vera Institute says its \u201cIncarceration Trends\u201d data tool is \u201cassembled using information collected by the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), supplemented with data from state departments of correction when federal data is not available.\u201d Its prison population estimate is very close to a\u00a0more recent figure from a report\u00a0from the Iowa Department of Human Rights, which said the total prison population in Iowa was \u201capproximately 24.5% African-American\u201d as of fiscal year 2018.", "We called\u00a0Tavis Hall, executive director of\u00a0Experience Waterloo, which promotes tourism in that Iowa city. He said he did speak with O\u2019Rourke about African American incarceration.", "Hall initially told us he didn\u2019t recall the source of the statistic he mentioned to O\u2019Rourke, but later he emailed us a link to the\u00a02017 annual report\u00a0from the Black Hawk County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Iowa. That report said that nearly 40 percent (2,003 of 5,720) of male inmates in Black Hawk County Jail that year were black.", "\u201cI likely conflated that number with the overall incarceration rate within the state,\u201d Hall explained.", "O\u2019Rourke repeated a variation of a claim we have fact-checked before, saying that states that have adopted universal background checks for gun purchases \u201chave seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent.\u201d Recent academic research does not support that.", "O\u2019Rourke: We know that in this country, those states that have adopted universal background checks and close every loophole \u2014 the Charleston loophole, the boyfriend loophole, the gun show loophole \u2014 and make sure that everyone who purchases a firearm goes through a background check, those states have seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent.", "O\u2019Rourke is a proponent of universal background checks, which would cover private sales by unlicensed individuals, including some sales at gun shows and over the internet. But he has repeatedly cited this misleading success rate, despite recent academic research that suggests it is wildly inflated.", "When O\u2019Rourke claimed in a May 7 campaign event that state laws mandating universal checks \u201chave been shown to reduce gun violence by 50 percent,\u201d his campaign pointed to research released by Everytown for Gun Safety in 2015 that found \u201cnearly 50 percent fewer police murdered with guns, women shot to death by intimate partners in states with background checks.\u201d This time, O\u2019Rourke added an \u201cup to\u201d qualifier \u2014 that \u201cstates have seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent\u201d \u2014 but the claim is still misleading.", "Boston University Community Health Sciences Professor Michael Siegel told us states that have lower firearm violence rates to begin with are the ones that tend to pass laws requiring universal background checks. A study he led looked at the change in gun violence rates after states passed (or got rid of) universal background checks and found\u00a0lower rates of violence associated with states with universal checks, but not nearly 50 percent lower.", "That study, published in March in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, looked at homicide and suicide rates in all 50 states over a 26-year period and found that universal background checks are associated with about a 15 percent reduction in firearm homicide. The study stopped short of concluding that the decline was caused by those laws.", "\u201cAfter reviewing the overall literature, I would estimate that the association is somewhere between a 10% and 15% reduction,\u201d Siegel told us via email. \u201cSo the 50% claim sounds exaggerated. I\u2019m not sure what data would support that.\u201d", "Siegel noted that his research found an \u201cassociation\u201d between universal background checks and reduced homicide rates, \u201cbut did not definitively conclude causality.\u201d", "A spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety told us it has updated the data cited by O\u2019Rourke about universal background checks as a result of new research.", "\u201cThe rigorous research that\u2019s come out since that release has improved our understanding of this, and we replaced the statistics from that (2015) release in more recent materials, including the background checks page,\u201d Adam Sege, a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety, told us. The current background checks page\u00a0cites a study in 2015 that concluded Connecticut\u2019s implementation of a handgun permit-to-purchase law \u201cwas associated with a 40% reduction in Connecticut\u2019s firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place.\u201d But that\u2019s a little different from a universal background check law \u2014\u00a0the law required background checks for handgun permits; it\u2019s just one state, and again, the researchers found association, not causality.", "In 2018, the RAND Corporation released several reports as part of its\u00a0Gun Policy in America initiative, including one on the \u201cEffects of Background Checks on Violent Crime.\u201d The review identified eight studies since 2003 that examined the relationship between background checks and violent crime, and that met its research criteria. The report concluded: \u201cEvidence that background checks may reduce violent crime and total homicides is limited, and studies provide moderate evidence that dealer background checks reduce firearm homicides. Evidence of the effect of private-seller background checks on firearm homicides is inconclusive.\u201d", "Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?", "A: Some research indicates possible negative effects from aspartame, but there\u2019s no definitive evidence linking it to health problems in the general population. Aspartame is safe when consumed within certain limits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The daily limit is above the amount people typically ingest."]
