["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "After losing the Texas and Ohio primaries March 4, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama tried to downplay the losses by emphasizing that he leads Sen. Hillary Clinton in delegates and the popular vote.", "\"The bottom line is, we've won twice as many states. We've won a greater share of the popular vote,\" he said.", "The first part is easy to assess. At the point when he made this comment, Obama had won primaries or caucuses in 25 states (including the District of Columbia), while Clinton had won 14 states (not counting Florida and Michigan). Obama's math is off, but he's in the ballpark. Still, he would have been more accurate if he said he had won\n\nnearly\n\ntwice as many states.", "The second part is a little trickier because some states that held caucuses \u2014 Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine \u2014 have not released popular vote totals. They've only released the percentage of the vote and the number of delegates won.", "Also, the election results from Florida and Michigan are in limbo because the Democratic National Committee has not recognized the results from those states because they defied the DNC schedule. It's further complicated by the fact that Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan.", "Adding up vote totals from the other contests, PolitiFact finds Obama to be ahead (as of March 7, 2008) by 13,002,527 to 12,413,052 if Michigan and Florida are not counted. He's also ahead by 13,578,741 to 13,284,038 if Florida is included but Michigan is not.", "The only scenario in which Clinton is ahead is if Michigan is also included. She has 13,612,347 to Obama's 13,578,741.", "We have to give thanks to\n\nRealClearPolitics.com,\n\nwhich tracks popular vote totals and provides links to results on state Web sites. We went to those individual sites and tallied the numbers on a spreadsheet.", "Keep in mind, some states are still adding up votes and these numbers will change. Also, we completed these calculations before the March 8, 2008, Wyoming caucus, so those results are not included.", "Back to Obama's claim: We find he has it mostly right. On the first part, he'd be better off hedging his claim on winning twice as many states as Clinton. But on the matter of popular vote, Obama is accurate. Though, to be fail-safe, he should have specified that he was excluding Michigan. Overall, we find his claim to be Mostly True.", "Alabama Secretary of State,\n\nPresidential preference primary,\n\nunofficial results, 67 of 67 counties reporting", "Alaska Democratic Party,\n\nObama wins 75% of Alaska delegates", "Arizona Secretary of State,\n\n2008 Presidential preference election,\n\nunofficial results", "Arkansas Secretary of State,\n\n2008 Presidential preferential primary election,\n\nstatewide results", "California Secretary of State,\n\nPresident Democratic,\n\nstatewide results", "Colorado Democratic Party,\n\nCaucus results,\n\nFeb. 5, 2008", "Connecticut Secretary of State,\n\nConnectict Democratic Presidential Primary,\n\nFeb. 5, 2008", "State of Delaware,\n\nPresidential Primary Election,\n\nofficial results", "District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics,\n\nDC Presidential preference primary,\n\ncertified election results", "Georgia Secretary of State,\n\nGeorgia Election Results,\n\nFeb. 5, 2008", "New York Times,\n\nHawaii caucus results", "Idaho State Democratic Party,\n\nFinal caucus results,\n\nFeb. 5, 2008", "Illinois State Board of Elections, Vote totals, general primary, president, Feb. 5, 2008", "New York Times,\n\nKansas caucus results", "Louisiana Secretary of State,\n\nOfficial election results,\n\nFeb. 9, 2008", "Maryland State Board of Elections,\n\nUnofficial 2008 Primary Election results for President of the United States", "New York Times,\n\nMassachusetts Primary Results", "Minnesota Secretary of State,\n\nUnofficial results presidential preference ballot", "Missouri Secretary of State,\n\nPresidential Preference Primary,\n\nFeb. 5, 2008", "Nebraska Democratic Party,\n\n2008 Presidential Caucus Results", "New Hampshire Secretary of State,\n\nPresidential Primary Election,\n\nJan. 8, 2008", "State of New Jersey,\n\nFebruary 2008 primary election", "Democratic Party of New Mexico,\n\nFinal Results of 2008 Democratic Caucus", "New York state,\n\nPresidential primary,\n\nFeb. 5, 2008", "CNN.com,\n\nNorth Dakota Results: Democratic caucuses", "Ohio Secretary of State,\n\nStatewide Presidential Results for Congressional Districts", "Oklahoma State Election Board,\n\nPresidential Preferential Primary Election,\n\nsummary results", "Rhode Island Board of Elections,\n\n2008 Presidential Preference Primary,\n\nStatewide summary", "State of South Carolina,\n\nSouth Carolina Official Results,\n\nDemocratic Presidential Preference Primary, Jan. 26, 2008", "State of Tennessee,\n\nDemocratic Primary Presidential Preference,\n\nunofficial results", "Texas Secretary of State,\n\n2008 Democratic Party Primary Election,\n\nunofficial results", "State of Utah,\n\nPresident Of The US (D) ,\n\nElection results", "New York Times,\n\nVermont primary results", "Virginia State Board of Elections,\n\n2008 February Democratic Presidential Primary Unofficial Results", "Wisconsin State Election Board,\n\nResults of President Primary Election,\n\nFeb. 19, 2008", "Democrats Abroad,\n\nGlobal presidential primary,\n\nresults report", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
