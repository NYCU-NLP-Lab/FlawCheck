It\u2019s more than the military spending of up to the next 12 countries combined, the Democratic mayor said.\n\nBooker made that point on the Feb. 1 episode of HBO\u2019s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" during a panel discussion about the recent Senate hearing on Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination to be U.S. Defense Secretary.\n\n\"The reality is we have to make sure that we have a military that\u2019s prepared, but right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined, and we\u2019ve got to start realizing that we can secure and protect ourselves, but also be responsible in the way that we do that,\" Booker said.\n\n\"And it\u2019s not unpatriotic to say that we\u2019re spending too much money,\" the mayor added. \"In fact, to me, that\u2019s the patriotic thing to say.\"\n\nBooker\u2019s claim is on target: The United States spent more on defense in 2011 than the combined total of other high-spending nations, according to data from two organizations considered to be leading authorities on worldwide military spending.\n\nThe first set of figures comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for 172 countries.\n\nIn 2011 -- the most recent year available -- the United States led the world in military spending at $711 billion, marking 41 percent of the world total, according to the institute. The next top 12 spending nations accounted for a combined total of $670.9 billion, according to the institute.\n\nU.S. expenditures were nearly five times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $143 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place with estimated spending of $71.9 billion.\n\nWe found similar results when we reviewed the data released by The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank which tracks military spending in 170 countries for its annual \"Military Balance\" report.\n\nAccording to IISS figures released last year, the United States\u2019 defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, making it the largest in the world. The combined total of the next top 9 nations was $486.7 billion, according to IISS figures.\n\nReferring to U.S. military spending, Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, explained in an e-mail: \"It is large because we have overseas interests all over the world, and we put a high premium on responsiveness and qualitative superiority.\"\n\nBut the United States is poised to restrain its defense expenditures in the coming years.\n\nIn addition to reduced costs from winding down the war in Afghanistan, the Budget Control Act of 2011 contains provisions that limit spending increases in defense and other areas over the next decade.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no single definition of what constitutes military spending.\n\nAs the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute points out on its website, \"the lack of sufficiently detailed data makes it difficult to apply a common definition of military expenditure on a worldwide basis.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a panel discussion on HBO\u2019s \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Booker claimed that \"right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined.\"\n\nThe mayor\u2019s statement is accurate, according to data from two leading authorities on worldwide military spending. One set of figures shows that, in 2011, military spending by the United States exceeded the combined total of the next 12 highest nations by roughly $40 billion.\n\nWe rate the statement True.", "To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "HBO, Real Time with Bill Maher, Feb. 1, 2013\n\nPolitiFact Ohio, Alan Simpson says U.S. military spending outpaces totals from the next 14 largest nations, combined, Dec. 5, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, Jon Huntsman says the U.S. spends more than all other countries combined on defense, Dec. 13, 2011\n\nU.S. Department of State, World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers 2005, accessed Feb. 6, 2013\n\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute, Background paper on SIPRI military expenditure data, 2011, April 17, 2012\n\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute, The 15 major spender countries in 2011, accessed Feb. 6, 2013\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, Trends in U.S. Military Spending, Aug. 23, 2012\n\nBrookings Institution, The Defense Budget and American Power, March 6, 2012\n\nThe International Institute for Strategic Studies, Military Balance 2012: Comparative Defence Statistics - Defence Budgets and Expenditures, March 7, 2012\n\nThe International Institute for Strategic Studies, Military Balance 2012, March 7, 2012\n\nBrookings Institution, The Implications of Military Spending Cuts for NATO\u2019s Largest Members, July 2012\n\nPeter G.
