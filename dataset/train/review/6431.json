Marketplace is a business and economic affairs program that\u00a0airs on NPR stations in many U.S. markets.", "\"From the Congressional Budget Office today, this little tidbit: You remember President Obama's plan to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour? He signed the executive order just the other day, right? Well, the CBO said today that will cost the economy 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016. Me? I figure the partisan bickering over that starts right about ... now.\"", "A PunditFact reader flagged Ryssdal's comments and asked us if they were accurate. (You can hear them about\u00a05 minutes into this podcast.)", "In this case, Ryssdal wrongly linked President Barack Obama's executive order for federal contract workers to what the CBO studied, which was the proposal to raise the minimum wage for workers nationwide.", "The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That\u2019s about 0.3 percent of the workforce.", "For the record, CBO analysts\u00a0also said the number of lost jobs could vary depending on a number of factors. Overall,\u00a0the effect could be anywhere from a \"very slight\" decrease in employment to a reduction of 1 million workers, CBO\u00a0found.", "The White House objected to CBO's findings, with economic adviser Jason Furman telling reporters\u00a0the report \"goes outside of the consensus view\" of economists who study the effect of higher minimum wages on employment.", "The CBO analysis did contain good news for the White House, however. It concluded an additional 900,000 families would be pulled out of poverty and 16.5 million workers would get a raise if the minimum wage is increased to $10.10 an hour.", "Marketplace\u00a0senior producer Sitara Nieves acknowledged the mistake in an email to PunditFact and said it would be corrected on air.", "Our ruling", "Ryssdal said a Congressional Budget Office report found that an executive order raising the minimum wage for new federal contract workers \"will cost the economy 500,000 jobs.\"", "A CBO analysis did conclude that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could cost the country 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016.
