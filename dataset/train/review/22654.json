This review was conducted in response to a request from Senator Barrasso, then Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Additionally, GAO interviewed knowledgeable officials from the White House, DOD, and DHS who were involved in supporting presidential travel. GAO also examined relevant guidance.", "To the column's left was a section summarizing the GAO's findings:", "GAO estimated that the major costs incurred by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the President\u2019s travel to Chicago, Illinois, and Palm Beach, Florida, from February 15, 2013, through February 18, 2013, were about $3.6 million, of which about $2.8 million in costs were incurred by DOD and $0.77 million by DHS (specifically, the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Secret Service). These costs consisted of the (1) operating expenses of the President\u2019s aircraft, supporting aircraft, and U.S. Coast Guard small boats; and (2) travel expenses, which include per diem (lodging and meals), commercial airfare, and rental cars for DOD and DHS personnel supporting the trip. They exclude certain classified DOD costs, and the salaries and benefits of U.S. government civilian and military personnel traveling with the President or involved with agency travel preparations since these personnel would have received their salaries and benefits for the conduct of their regular duties and responsibilities regardless of whether the President traveled. The table highlights the estimated major costs associated with the President\u2019s February 2013 trip.", "The audit was requested by Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso in November 2013. In a letter attributed to Barrasso (the full text of which was unavailable), the Senator was quoted as saying of the request:", "At a time when government agencies and programs were preparing to implement tough cost-saving measures in order to meet the budgetary constraints of sequestration. President Obama chose to use taxpayer money for a weekend trip to play golf. I have heard from a number of concerned constituents in my state who believe the money used for this trip could have been spent in a manner that would have reduced the federal deficit or have helped reduce the impact of sequestration on the public.", "Barrasso referenced the cost of the trip as a potential offset to the federal deficit, which just prior to his November 2013 request news outlets  reported had fallen to $680 billion in Fiscal Year 2013. Were President Obama's travels in that three-day period rounded up to $4 million, that cost would account for 0.00059 percent of the 2013 federal deficit.", "In a response to Barrasso dated 11 October 2016, the GAO reported:", "You requested that we examine DOD\u2019s and DHS\u2019s (Secret Service and Coast Guard) costs associated with the President\u2019s February 15, 2013, Letter Page 2 GAO-17-24 Presidential Travel through February 18, 2013 travel to Illinois and Florida.

Afterwards, the President flew from Chicago to Palm Beach, Florida, before returning to Joint Base Andrews on February 18, 2013. No public events were scheduled while the President was in Florida; White House officials stated the President was on vacation during this time.

We also collected data from the Secret Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. These data include fiscal year 2013 aircraft and boat-related operating expenses and travel expenses\u2014including commercial air travel and per diem expenses (such as food and lodging) and rental cars for DOD, the Secret Service, and Coast Guard personnel supporting the trip. We calculated aircraft-related operating expenses for the President\u2019s 2013 trip by using the estimated cost per flight hour and the actual flight hours for each specific aircraft type as reported to us by the Air Force and Marine Corps to estimate the total cost per aircraft involved. We obtained the estimated cost per flight hour rate from the Air Force and Marine Corps.", "According to the GAO report on which the articles about President Obama's alleged $4 million golf outing with Tiger Woods were based, the costs of President Obama's trips to Illinois and Florida in February 2013 \"were about $3.6 million, of which about $2.8 million in costs were incurred by DOD and $0.77 million by DHS.\" The total sum referenced in the \"$4 million\" number was not only rounded up from the $3.6 million estimate, but it combined the costs of an official business trip as well as a brief vacation in Florida. Although President Obama met and played golf with Tiger Woods during the second leg of his travel, that outing did not itself cost $3.6 million dollars (or any specific amount of money cited in the GAO audit).", "Any presidential travel is necessarily costly in general (from an accounting standpoint, at least), but we note in a separate article that estimated expenses for presidential air travel are based on an accounting formula that is often highly misleading about the true costs involved.", "Boyer, Dave. \u00a0 \"Obama\u2019s Golf Weekend With Tiger Woods Cost Taxpayers More Than $3.6 Million.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Washington Times. \u00a0 26 October 2016.", "Calmes, Jackie. \u00a0 \"Back In A Swing State, This Time For Sport.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 New York Times. \u00a0 17 February 2013.", "Holland, Steve. \u00a0 \"In A First, Obama Plays Golf With Tiger Woods.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Reuters. \u00a0 17 February 2013.", "Irwin, Neil. \u00a0 \"Congratulations, America!
