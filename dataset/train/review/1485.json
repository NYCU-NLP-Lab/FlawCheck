["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on February 6, 2020", "A report by a conservative legal organization about voter registration rates in eight Iowa counties has been cited to promote baseless suggestions of voter fraud.", "Amid the Iowa caucuses, the founder of a conservative group and Iowa\u2019s secretary of state, a Republican, went head-to-head on Twitter over voter registration rates in the state.", "The organization, Judicial Watch, published a Feb. 3 press release that claimed that \u201ceight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than their eligible voting-age population.\u201d Its founder, Tom Fitton, made the same claim a day earlier on Twitter \u2014 prompting Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate to dispute the findings as \u201cfalse claims\u201d that \u201cerode voter confidence in elections.\u201d", "The allegations took root online with a clear theme: voter fraud.", "Fitton said in an interview with FactCheck.org that his organization\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t allege voter fraud in Iowa, but that was a pervading interpretation spread by those touting the findings.", "Charlie Kirk of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, for example, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWOW: One day before the Iowa Caucus, it\u2019s been revealed that EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there \u2026 Don\u2019t let voter fraud steal the 2020 election.\u201d", "The same text as Kirk\u2019s tweet appeared on Facebook pages like \u201cWalk Away Democrats,\u201d and a graphic with the phrase \u201cvoter fraud\u201d was used to tout the findings in a Facebook meme and by the conservative website the Gateway Pundit. Facebook and Twitter posts accused Democrats of \u201ccheating.\u201d One website, tediummedia.com, spread a story about the findings whose headline read, \u201cVoter Fraud Ahead of Iowa Caucus, More than 18,000 EXTRA Names on Voter Rolls.\u201d", "But Judicial Watch\u2019s findings are not evidence of voter fraud, according to experts, who also contested the group\u2019s methodology.", "A spokeswoman for Judicial Watch confirmed that the organization relied on two sets of data: U.S. Census figures, which showed the county-by-county population of the Citizen Voting Age Population, or CVAP, based on the 2014-2018 American Community Survey five-year estimates, and 2018 total voter registration tallies from the Election Administration and Voting Survey by the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission.", "Using the most up-to-date voter registration figures from the Iowa Secretary of State\u2019s office would tell a different story. Looking at total voter registration figures updated as of Feb. 3, five of the eight counties have more total registered voters than voting-age citizens. Total registration includes active and inactive voters. Looking at just active voters from the state\u2019s most recent figures, only one of the eight counties \u2014 Dallas County \u2014 has more active registered voters (59,667) than the population of voting-age citizens estimated by the Census (57,045).", "Even so, that would compare five-year estimates of the population from 2014-2018 with 2020 registration figures. The bigger issue is using Judicial Watch\u2019s methodology as a barometer for nefarious behavior.", "David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University and professor of law at the University of Minnesota, said he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow anyone credible using what Judicial Watch is using as a measure\u201d to determine voter fraud.", "\u201cThis is a real apples and oranges kind of problem here,\u201d Schultz said in a phone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know [what] the different populations of these different counties are because these data are old.\u201d", "In other words, we don\u2019t have concrete 2020 population figures for the counties to compare to 2020 voter registration figures.", "And, Schultz said, people don\u2019t typically take the time to contact their local governments when they move \u2014 meaning they remain on the voting rolls after they leave, for at least some time.", "(Registered voters in Iowa could be deemed inactive, for example, if they haven\u2019t voted or updated their registration information in a four-year span or if certain mailings are returned as undeliverable, according to a spokesman for the secretary of state. Under state law, if a voter\u2019s record has been deemed inactive for \u201ctwo successive general elections,\u201d that registration is to be canceled.)", "\u201cHow are they accounting for in-migration, out-migration?\u201d Schultz, who teaches research methodology courses, said. \u201cIf one of my grad students did a paper like this and didn\u2019t talk about some of these methodology issues, I would have some real problems [with that].\u201d", "Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University and voter fraud expert, recently wrote about the issue in a blog post after Judicial Watch issued legal threats to several states over their voter rolls.", "\u201cRegistration is a hard count of individuals, Census estimates of CVAP are survey estimates and projections. Among other things: the latter comes with a margin of error,\u201d Levitt wrote. \u201cThese metrics cover different time periods. The CVAP estimates are estimates over a (usually) multi-year period, often several years behind any current snapshot of a registration count.\u201d", "\u201cThey measure different things, at different times, with different types of levels of certainty,\u201d Levitt said in an email to FactCheck.org. He said it\u2019s \u201cbad science to claim that a disconnect between those two numbers means that there\u2019s fraud.\u201d", "Levitt said that some researchers \u201cmay be interested in a voter registration rate that attempts to assess current registration as a percentage of eligible population using the two different measures \u2014 the EAVS registration snapshot and census population estimates.\u201d But, he said, \u201cevery careful researcher I know fully understands the disconnect between those data sources, and either attempts to account for them or only uses the measures for broad comparisons over time rather than the silly \u2018over 100%\u2019 or \u2018under 100%\u2019 distinction Judicial Watch is attempting to make.\u201d", "Fitton told us he stands by his organization\u2019s analysis and cited legal victories the group has secured to force the maintenance of voter rolls. Judicial Watch sued Los Angeles County and California, for example, and reached a settlement in 2019 in which the county agreed to remove inactive voters after a period of time, pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act (and a 2018 Supreme Court decision that found such removal is mandatory).", "The settlement noted there was no admission of wrongdoing. It also made no mention of voter fraud.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
