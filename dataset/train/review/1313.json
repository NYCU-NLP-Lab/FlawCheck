["Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.", "More Info", "When the Milwaukee County Board completed its work on the 2013 budget in November 2012, the property tax levy was about $4 million higher than it was for the current year.\n\nSupervisors overrode 22 of 24 budget vetoes from \u00a0County Executive Chris Abele, thwarting his effort to create a budget that included no increase. The final 2013 budget tallied $1.3 billion, with $279.3 million coming from property taxes. That\u2019s an increase of 1.4 percent.\n\nCounty Board Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic defended the board\u2019s budget in a Nov. 14, 2012, interview on WTMJ-AM (620), noting the budget boosted public safety.\n\nBut then she touted the tax levy increase as a decrease for City of Milwaukee taxpayers.\n\nHuh?\n\nHere\u2019s how Dimitrijevic explained it:\n\n\"If you live in the City of Milwaukee, the City of Milwaukee our largest municipality, the 1.4 percent that we increased taxes this year -- lower than inflation, like the city of Milwaukee, like Ozaukee County \u2013 in the city of Milwaukee on the average home, would be a $19 decrease. And I think that\u2019s a small price to pay for enhanced public safety.\"\n\nWith property tax bills landing in mailboxes, time for a refresher course on how this all works.\n\nCounty Board fiscal and budget analyst Steve Cady said the claim was based on City of Milwaukee property revaluations, which were set in spring 2012. These are done annually to keep up with changes in the housing market.\n\nThe average Milwaukee house had an assessed value of about $106,000. The tax rate set in the county budget is about $5.25 per $1,000 of assessed value. That\u2019s up 54 cents. (On the tax bill, the county tax rate is lumped together with the rate to support the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, but that group\u2019s portion of the bill is tiny.)\n\nHow much you owe is determined by the value of your house.\n\nIn the 2012 reassessment, the average home in the city fell from $122,793 to $106,000. That means even though the tax rate went up, the bill for the county share of taxes went \u00a0down on that home by about $19.\n\nSo in dollars and cents terms, Dimitrijevic is correct.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more to the story.\n\nAcross the country the value of residential property got hammered in the real estate bust, and Milwaukee was no exception. Between the beginning of 2008 and 2012, total assessed residential property value in Milwaukee fell by about 30 percent, said assessment commissioner Mary Reavey. Of course, it depends on your neighborhood and condition of your home -- some losses could be much higher (or lower) than others.\n\n\"Most people don\u2019t cheer when their major asset goes down in value,\" noted Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner who operates her own firm in Glendale.\n\nBut, in effect, that is what Dimitrijevic is suggesting Milwaukee property owners do.\n\nWhat about the reverse? Should homeowners want their house values and tax bill to increase?\n\nNot necessarily, said Michael Arnow, a certified financial planner with Menomonee Falls-based Sattell, Johnson, Appel Financial Advisory LLC.\n\n\"A higher assessment is a double-edged sword,\" he said. \"If your tax bill goes up, you pay more taxes. Who wants to pay more taxes? If the value of your home goes up and you are a retiree on a fixed income you can be priced out of your neighborhood.\"\n\nIn the case of this year\u2019s bills, property owners may be paying somewhat less in taxes but the long-term loss is more serious, experts said.\n\nFor that average City of Milwaukee homeowner, the total tax bill for all taxing units this year would be $3,175, down about $107 from a year ago. That\u2019s a small amount compared with the $16,000 in lost property value.\n\nSaid Hogan: \"If taxes are going down because the assessed value is going down, that\u2019s not a good thing.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nDimitrijevic said the average city of Milwaukee homeowner would pay $19 less in county property taxes next year. She is correct on the bottom-line number. But by highlighting it as a piece of good news, she is leaving out critical information that would give a different impression. Namely, tax bills aren\u2019t down because spending was cut by the County Board.\n\nThe bills are down in the City of Milwaukee because property values have fallen. Had there been no change in city property values, that bill would be $84 higher -- just to pay for the County Board\u2019s decisions.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "WTMJ (AM 620) interview, Marina Dimitrijevic, Nov. 14, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Milwaukee County Board overrides 22 of 24 Abele vetoes,\"Nov. 14, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Abele loses budget war to Milwaukee County Board,\"Nov. 18, 2012\n\nMillwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Abele talks county board overhaul,\"Nov. 28, 2012\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"Comparing tax rates, levies in the city of Milwaukee,\" Nov. 30, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Mary Reavey, City of Milwaukee Commissioner of Assessments, Dec. 10, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Paula Hogan, financial planner, Dec. 10, 2012\n\nEmail, Michael Arnow, Sattell, Johnson, Appel Financial Advisory, LLC, Dec. 11, 2012\n\nEmails, Velia Alvarez,Public Information Manager, Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors, Nov. 20, 2012\n\nEmails, Mark Nicolini, Budget & Management Director, City of Milwaukee, Dec. 6, 2012", "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter", "In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n\n\n\nSign me up", "Sign me up", "District of Columbia\n\n\n\n1800 I Street NW\n\nWashington, DC\n20006", "Florida\n\n\n801 3rd St. S\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n33701\n727-821-9494"]
