In summary, most of the \u201cbenefits\u201d could be had either if we remained in EU, or if we left\u2014but the claims are broadly accurate as descriptions of the EU status quo.", "Of the issues raised in the claims, the greatest degree of immigration control is only available by leaving, while tariff free trade with the EU and the ability to veto various EU decisions could only be guaranteed by remaining. (Though we might be able to leave the EU and keep tariff free trade, that outcome depends on negotiations with the EU.)", "One claim about the UK\u2019s rebate on EU budget contributions is uncertain, as the EU has signalled its intention to end such rebates.", "Honesty in public debate matters", "You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email", "I\u2019m in", "This depends on how you interpret \u201ccontrol of our borders\u201d.
