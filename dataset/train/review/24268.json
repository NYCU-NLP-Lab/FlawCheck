["About this rating", "Actor and director Clint Eastwood has long been critical of the left in American politics, and is considered as an icon by some on the right for being one of the rare outspoken political conservatives in Hollywood. As a result, his words (or at least close approximations of them) often appear on pro-Trump Facebook pages.", "One entry from the \u201cclose approximation\" camp is found in a meme posted the Facebook group \u201cDonald Trump for President 2020!!!!!!\u201d that purportedly reproduced an Eastwood comment about President Obama:", "Although Clint Eastwood did not say these words exactly as stated in the meme, they appear to be a reasonably close paraphrase of comments he gave to the Carmel Pine Cone (the local newspaper of the California town for which Eastwood once served as mayor) following his controversial and meandering improvised \"empty chair\" speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention. In that article, Eastwood reflected on the criticism of his speech (emphasis ours):", "After a week as topic No. 1 in American politics, former Carmel Mayor Clint Eastwood said the outpouring of criticism from left-wing reporters and liberal politicians after his appearance at the Republican National Convention, followed by an avalanche of support on Twitter and in the blogosphere, is all the proof anybody needs that his 12-minute discourse achieved exactly what he intended it to.>", "\u201cPresident Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,\u201d Eastwood told The Pine Cone. \u201cRomney and Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that\u2019s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle.\u201d", "Although the meme added some text and replaced \u201choax\u201d with \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cthe Obama presidency\u201d with \u201cPresident Obama,\u201d the primary meaning remained unchanged.", "NPR. \u00a0 \"Transcript: Clint Eastwood's Convention Remarks.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 30 August 2012.", "Miller Paul. \u00a0 \"Eastwood Says His Convention Appearance Was 'Mission Accomplished'.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Carmel Pine Cone. \u00a0 7 September 2012.", "Alex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.", "Your membership is the foundation of our sustainability and resilience.", "Company", "Navigate", "Sections", "Account", "\u00a9 1995 - 2023  by Snopes Media Group Inc.", "This material may not be reproduced without permission.", "Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"]
