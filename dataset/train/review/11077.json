["By Saranac Hale Spencer", "Posted on November 22, 2017", "Q: Has the Food and Drug Administration announced that vaccines cause autism?", "A: No.\u00a0FDA statements are grounded in scientific evidence. There is no evidence that vaccination is linked to autism.", "FDA ANNOUNCED THAT VACCINES ARE CAUSING AUTISM! Is this true?", "The Food and Drug Administration credits vaccines for the decline of many infectious diseases over the last century, and more than a decade of peer-reviewed studies show there is no link between their use and autism.", "However, a story perpetuating the myth that vaccines cause autism has prompted several questions to FactCheck.org and has been getting popular on Facebook, where it was flagged by the social network\u2019s users as potentially false. It is.", "The headline on the story says: \u201cNOW IT\u2019S OFFICIAL: FDA Announced That Vaccines Are Causing Autism!\u201d", "But the FDA has made no such announcement, and the only evidence that the story gives to support its claim is the label from a vaccine called Tripedia, which was discontinued in 2011.", "That evidence is pretty weak, since the label\u00a0for Tripedia lists autism along with 10 other \u201cadverse events\u201d that were voluntarily reported by doctors or parents who had their children get the shot. Autism was not found to be among the effects identified in the studies of that drug before it went to market.", "Importantly, the label also says: \u201cBecause these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.\u201d", "Further illustrating why relying on voluntary reporting is a problem, the label also notes that 13 out of the nearly 15,000 infants who were in a study of the vaccine in Germany died \u2014 one of them in a car crash and another accidentally drowned.", "Tripedia, which was first approved for use in the U.S. in 1992, was a vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough that had trace amounts of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. It had such a small amount of that ingredient \u2014 less than 0.3 micrograms \u2014 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would have no biological effect and could be treated as a thimerosal-free product. But for those who believe there is a connection between vaccines and autism, thimerosal has served as an enduring link since the late 1990s.", "In 1998, Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist, published a fraudulent paper that was retracted when the study could not be replicated and he was found to have engaged in unethical conduct. That paper, which was\u00a0published in\u00a0The Lancet,\u00a0offered the now discredited conclusion that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination was linked to autism. The Lancet not only\u00a0retracted\u00a0that paper, but the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom\u00a0stripped Wakefield of his ability to practice medicine\u00a0for his dishonesty and irresponsibility in the paper.", "But he had already planted the seed for the idea that vaccines could cause autism and it was then picked up and trumpeted by some politicians and, perhaps most loudly, by celebrity-turned-activist Jenny McCarthy.", "In fact, there is no evidence that vaccines cause autism. (We covered this and related vaccine issues\u00a0in 2015, when Sen. Rand Paul claimed that he had heard of \u201cmany\u201d children that developed \u201cprofound mental disorders\u201d after receiving vaccinations.)", "Similarly, there is no link between thimerosal and autism. However, as a precaution, the FDA recommended taking that ingredient out of all vaccines in 1999.\u00a0\u201cBetween 1999 and 2001, thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for some flu vaccines,\u201d according to the CDC.", "The story that is currently circulating on Facebook is tinged with conspiracy theory. It suggests that the \u201cpharmaceutical mafia\u201d is using vaccines to cause a \u201cdepopulation of our planet.\u201d But it is just the most recent version of the story. Claims based on the Tripedia label have been making the rounds on the internet since at least 2008.", "The company that made Tripedia, Sanofi Pasteur, has replaced it with DAPTACEL, which contains no thimerosal, according to the CDC.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook\u00a0to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "Food and Drug Administration.
