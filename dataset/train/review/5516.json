["By Angelo Fichera", "Posted on March 10, 2020", "A popular blog post being shared on Facebook falsely claims that former President Jimmy Carter has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. The post was lifted \u2014 almost verbatim \u2014 from an old story about Carter\u2019s support for Sanders\u2019 2016 bid.", "Former Democratic President Jimmy Carter hasn\u2019t yet endorsed anyone in the 2020 presidential primary, but a story shared by thousands on Facebook falsely claims he has.", "The post, published on March 7 by a blog called \u201cLiberty Inquiries,\u201d has a fictitious headline that reads: \u201cFormer President Jimmy Carter Has Endorsed Bernie Sanders.\u201d", "The text of the blog post is actually lifted mostly verbatim from a May 2017 article\u00a0from the website Talking Points Memo, which reported on Carter\u2019s belated revelation that he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary in Georgia.", "Both the blog post and the Talking Points article quote Carter as saying, \u201cCan y\u2019all see why I voted for him?\u201d \u2014 something the 39th president actually said at a May 2017 Carter Center event alongside Sanders, referencing the 2016 election.", "But the false blog post now circulating deceivingly frames it as a story about an endorsement for Sanders\u2019 2020 candidacy.", "The original Talking Points story reads: \u201cCarter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2016 election, declining to endorse either candidate in the primary and quietly endorsing Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, calling her \u2018unpopular\u2019 in his endorsement.\u201d", "That was changed in the false blog post to read: \u201cCarter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2020 election.\u201d", "The blog post ends with four sentences about Carter\u2019s time in office; we found that was taken from a brief Carter profile published by the University of Virginia Miller Center.", "The false story appeared in Facebook groups supportive of Sanders and surfaced in the lead-up to the March 10 Democratic contests in six states. The primary election in Georgia, where Carter lives, will take place March 24\u00a0 \u2014 which also disproves the bogus story, whose first sentence says Carter \u201cslyly revealed who he voted for in the Democratic primary Monday.\u201d", "We could find no record of Carter endorsing any candidate in the primary yet \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if he will. He did not announce an endorsement in the 2016 primary, and didn\u2019t publicly reveal his vote for Sanders until 2017.", "In September 2019, Carter was asked about what the 2020 Democratic candidates should be talking about. He emphasized his desire to see them promote world peace and human rights. He said at the time that he hadn\u2019t settled on a preferred candidate.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to vote for one of them and I haven\u2019t decided yet which one,\u201d he said. \u201cI voted for Bernie Sanders last time \u2026 but I\u2019m going to keep an open mind. One of the major factors that I will have in my mind is who can beat Trump. Because I think it would be a disaster to have four more years of Trump.\u201d", "A USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll in 2019 asked likely Democratic voters about the effect of past presidential nominees\u2019 endorsements for 2020; 11 percent of those surveyed said an endorsement by Carter would influence their vote.", "Editor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
