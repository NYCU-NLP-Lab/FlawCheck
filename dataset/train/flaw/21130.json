{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the practice and circumstances of late-term abortions by suggesting that doctors and mothers \"execute\" the baby, which is not an accurate representation of the decision-making process involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that late-term abortions are solely for the purpose of executing the baby, disregarding the legitimate reasons such as immediate threat to the mother's life or severe abnormalities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that late-term abortions involve the execution of the baby.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately describing the decision-making process and medical procedures involved in late-term abortions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that living infants receive care and that there are existing laws and statutes to protect the rights of infants born at any stage of development.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by medical researchers, who describe the decision as whether to resuscitate the baby rather than execute it.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the rarity of late-term abortions, which account for a small percentage (1.4%) of all abortions reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."}
