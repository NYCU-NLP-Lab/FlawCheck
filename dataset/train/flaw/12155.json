{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only relies on reports from a federal database without considering further studies or investigations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the death reports in the federal database directly show the fatal risk of COVID-19 vaccines, which is a problematic assumption as the database itself states that the reports do not indicate causation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths mentioned in the federal database, such as pre-existing health conditions or other factors unrelated to the vaccine.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines by focusing solely on the death reports without acknowledging the extensive safety data involving tens of thousands of people.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective through rigorous studies and trials, which is not reflected in the death reports from the federal database.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the implication that COVID-19 vaccines contributed to the deaths of dozens of people, without considering the lack of causation established by the federal database and the need for further study.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) as evidence, despite the agencies running the system warning against misinterpretation and cautioning against drawing inferences from the reports alone."}
