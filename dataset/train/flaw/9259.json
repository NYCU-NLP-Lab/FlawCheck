{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"18 million people received additional grant payments.\" The latest government data is from July 2020, and there is a discrepancy in the number of beneficiaries reported by different sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all social grants were increased during the Covid-19 pandemic and that the SRD grant was meant to end in October 2020. However, this may not be the case as the situation could have changed or there may be alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The discrepancy in the number of beneficiaries reported by different sources raises the possibility of alternative explanations for the claim. The different figures provided by Sassa and the NIDS-CRAM report suggest that there may be different methodologies or criteria used to determine the number of grant recipients.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times due to the lack of consistent and up-to-date data on the number of grant recipients. The claim relies on data from July 2020 and there is uncertainty about the accuracy of the numbers reported.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of grant recipients if the figure of 18 million is accurate. The range provided by combining different sources suggests that the actual number of recipients could be higher.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the number of grant recipients. However, without more recent and reliable data, it is difficult to determine the extent of any exaggeration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any established facts. However, the lack of consistent and up-to-date data raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
