{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not supported by the research conducted by USA TODAY.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Regeneron antibody cocktail used to treat President Trump is made from fetal stem cells, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the antibodies used in the Regeneron cocktail are obtained from SARS-CoV-2 human survivors and immunized mice engineered with a human immune system, rather than directly from fetal or embryonic stem cells.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the experimental antibody therapy received by President Trump was not made from fetal or embryonic stem cells.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the Regeneron antibody cocktail and fetal stem cells, as the involvement of a non-stem cell embryonic-derived cell line in the early stages of testing does not imply that the therapy is made from fetal stem cells.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the involvement of the embryonic-derived cell line in the early stages of testing does not impact the production of the antibody therapy."}
