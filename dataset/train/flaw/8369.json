{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"illegal immigrants\" killing 10,150 Americans in 2018 is an exaggeration, as it is not supported by any scientific studies, census data, or news reports.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support from reliable sources to validate the number of deaths attributed to \"illegal immigrants.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report, which states that there were just over 1,600 homicide convictions on the criminal records of people arrested by ICE for being in the country illegally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between illegal immigration and the number of Americans killed, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the homicides.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the number of homicides, such as factors unrelated to illegal immigration, socio-economic conditions, or other demographic factors.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual homicide rate in the United States, as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program estimated that 16,214 murders occurred in 2018, which is significantly higher than the claimed number.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting inconsistent numbers and variations, indicating a lack of consistency or accuracy in the information provided."}
