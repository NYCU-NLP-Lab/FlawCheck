{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the statement that state employees are going to get a pay raise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that state employees will receive a pay raise without providing any clear justification or explanation for why this would be the case.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not provide a clear and consistent explanation for the supposed pay raise, with different explanations and interpretations provided by the governor's office and the press secretary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the statement, such as the end of furlough days imposed under the previous administration, which could result in state workers receiving more money in their paychecks without it being a formal pay raise."}
