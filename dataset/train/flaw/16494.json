{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Missouri has more crime percentage-wise than the rest of the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Missouri has more crime percentage-wise than the rest of the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the overall crime rate throughout the country is going down, which may not be supported by the available data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in crime rates between Missouri and the rest of the country that are not considered in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the decrease in crime rates in Missouri by focusing on the increase over a five-year period rather than the recent decrease in the past year.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Missouri's violent crime rate decreased by 5.2% in the last year, while the rest of the country saw a 3% decrease.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on outdated statistics from 2011 and not considering more recent data."}
