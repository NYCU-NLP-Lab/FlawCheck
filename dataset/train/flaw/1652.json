{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not fully established how increased access to marijuana is causing increased cases of the syndrome.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in documented cases of \"scromiting\" is solely linked to chronic heavy marijuana use without considering other factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the prevalence and understanding of the condition, as it is described as rare and poorly understood, but the expert's verdict mentions that it is a real condition with documented cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the mechanism by which cannabis-induced hyperemesis occurs is unknown, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the occurrence of \"scromiting\" beyond chronic heavy marijuana use."}
