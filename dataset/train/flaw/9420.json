{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the attribution of the quote to Cicero, as no official documentation of Cicero's writings or speeches includes anything close to the passage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quote is a genuine warning about Trump, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cicero died in 43 B.C., a year before the meme claims he said the quote.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the quote by presenting it as a \"two thousand Year Old warning about TRUMP,\" without considering other possible interpretations or applications of the quote.", "Understate": "There is no evidence presented in the claim that suggests alternative explanations for the quote or its attribution to Cicero.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a fictional novel from 1965 as a source for the quote, rather than verifiable historical documents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the quote or its origins, such as the possibility that it was misattributed to Cicero or that it was a later fabrication."}
