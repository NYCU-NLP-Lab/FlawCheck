{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the economic growth rate by stating that it has not been seen in a century in America, when in reality, the data only goes back to 1930.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that the economic growth rate has not been under 2 percent for each decade going back a century.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only way to define a decade is by counting backward from 2016, disregarding other possible definitions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for defining a decade based on periods beginning in years that end in zero, which would contradict the claim's argument.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the economic growth rate by using an average of less than 2 percent, as the yearly rates ranged from a drop of -2.8 percent to a high of 2.9 percent during the specified period."}
