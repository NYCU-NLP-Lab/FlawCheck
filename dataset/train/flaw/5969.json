{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in the cost of health care reform, stating that it will rise to $1.8 trillion, which is far greater than the originally projected $900 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that the cost of health care reform will increase to $1.8 trillion. It only mentions a report from the Congressional Budget Office without providing further details or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost increase in health care reform is a negative aspect, without considering potential benefits or cost savings that may be associated with the reform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in cost, such as changes in economic conditions, healthcare needs, or other factors that may have influenced the projected costs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original cost estimate for health care reform was $900 billion, as stated by President Obama. The claim suggests that the actual cost will be far greater than this estimate.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not consistently provide accurate or reliable information, as it fails to provide sufficient evidence or support for the stated increase in cost.", "Other potential biases": "The claim does not show any other clear biases such as cherry-picking data, generalization, or personal opinion."}
