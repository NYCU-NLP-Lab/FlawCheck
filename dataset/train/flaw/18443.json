{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the influence of the Commission on Presidential Debates' \"head guy\" working for Bill Clinton, implying that the debates are completely \"rigged\" because of this association.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the debates are rigged solely based on the Commission on Presidential Debates' affiliation with Bill Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the past affiliation of the Commission on Presidential Debates' co-chair with Bill Clinton automatically means that the debates are rigged, without considering other factors or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the fact that the Commission on Presidential Debates has a co-chair who was the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, suggesting a bipartisan composition that counters the notion of bias or rigging."}
