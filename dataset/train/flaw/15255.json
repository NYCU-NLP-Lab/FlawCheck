{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it suggests that there was an agreement that the president could have signed to keep 10,000 troops in Iraq, but fails to provide enough evidence or support for this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence about the alleged agreement that could have kept 10,000 troops in Iraq.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the presence of 10,000 troops would have created the stability necessary for Iraq to progress, without providing sufficient evidence or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that negotiations for a residual force in Iraq faced opposition both in the United States and in Iraq, leading to a smaller force being considered instead.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Status of Forces Agreement signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 called for the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 2011, without specifying a specific number to be left behind.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexities and challenges involved in negotiating a new agreement for a residual force in Iraq, as it simplifies the situation by suggesting that the president could have signed an agreement to keep 10,000 troops without addressing the opposition and difficulties faced during negotiations."}
