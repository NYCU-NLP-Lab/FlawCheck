{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the claim that Tom Nelson backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nelson's vote against the state budget automatically means he voted against the Social Security provision it contained, which may not necessarily be true.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was not a proposal for higher taxes on Social Security, as the budget actually eliminated state income taxes on Social Security benefits.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Nelson's vote by not considering other factors or reasons he may have had for voting against the budget.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Nelson's vote against the budget, such as his stated reason of reduced funding for education."}
