{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Rick Perry relied on stimulus funds to close the state's budget deficit in 2010. The expert's verdict mentions that Perry used $6.4 billion in stimulus aid, but it does not provide information on the overall size of the budget deficit or the proportion that was covered by stimulus funds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Rick Perry relied the most on stimulus funds compared to other governors. The expert's verdict mentions that Texas leaned heavily on stimulus aid, but it does not provide a comparison with other states or governors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that relying on stimulus funds to close a budget deficit is inherently negative or problematic. It does not consider alternative perspectives or the reasons why states may have chosen to use stimulus funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Rick Perry relied on stimulus funds, such as the impact of the economic recession or the specific budgetary challenges faced by Texas at the time."}
