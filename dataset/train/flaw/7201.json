{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states that meet every other year, as it only mentions five states, but there may be more states with biennial legislative sessions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to confirm the number of states with shorter legislative sessions. The source of the information is not provided, and the claim is based on the opinion of one individual.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that shorter legislative sessions would make public service in the General Assembly more accessible and bring a wider diversity of life experiences into the legislature. This assumption may be problematic and subjective, as it does not consider other factors that contribute to the accessibility and diversity of the legislature.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the uncontested seats in the November 2012 elections, and it cannot solely be attributed to the length of the General Assembly session. Other factors such as political dynamics, party affiliations, and candidate popularity could also play a role."}
