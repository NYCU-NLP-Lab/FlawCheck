{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the impact of sequestration on the military by stating that it has been cut down to the smallest Army since 1940 and the smallest Navy since 1915. The expert's verdict points out that technology and overall capabilities have significantly grown since then, making a direct comparison inaccurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the size of the Army and Navy is the sole determinant of military strength, which may not be entirely accurate. The expert's verdict mentions that comparing the military size of today to that of decades ago is comparing apples to oranges due to technological advancements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the military has been cut down to the smallest size since 1940 and 1915. The expert's verdict provides some evidence regarding reductions in the number of soldiers and ships but does not provide comprehensive data for a complete evaluation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the reduction in military size, such as the ending of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which led to a decrease in the number of soldiers. The expert's verdict mentions that the reductions are not solely due to sequestration but also the result of the ending of wars.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States has increased its operations in Iraq and Syria, indicating that the military is not necessarily shrinking. The expert's verdict highlights this contradiction."}
