{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"34% of Wisconsin renters are at risk of eviction.\" It only refers to a CNBC report and a survey without providing specific details or methodology.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CNBC report and survey accurately represent the eviction risk for Wisconsin renters, without considering potential limitations or biases in the data.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the actual eviction risk for Wisconsin renters, as it only mentions the 34% figure without providing any context or comparison to other states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in eviction filings in Wisconsin, such as changes in local policies or economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the eviction filings in Wisconsin decreased in July, which suggests a more nuanced situation than the claim implies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing the most up-to-date information or taking into account potential changes since the time the claim was made.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the eviction risk by using a generalized national statistic (40% of renter households nationwide) and applying it directly to Wisconsin without considering state-specific factors."}
