{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which many local governments in Wisconsin require employees to pay 20 percent, 30 percent, or even 40 percent of their health insurance premiums. The expert's verdict points out that the average premium for family coverage in school districts is only 4 percent, and only 6 out of 130 school districts ask for more than 12 percent in premiums on family coverage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence from a survey of school district cost-sharing on health insurance, which contradicts the claim. The survey shows that the average premium for family coverage is only 4 percent, not the higher percentages claimed in the original statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that many local governments in Wisconsin already require employees to pay high percentages of their health insurance premiums, but the expert's verdict challenges this assumption with evidence from the survey, which shows that only a small number of school districts ask for more than 12 percent in premiums on family coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that local governments in Wisconsin already require high percentages of health insurance premiums from employees, but the expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by providing evidence that contradicts this claim. The evidence from the survey shows that the average premium for family coverage is only 4 percent, indicating that the claim may not be accurate."}
