It is based on a single Facebook post and a few tweets, which may not provide a comprehensive picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the employee's behavior represents the official stance of Spirit Airlines towards the military. It may be an overgeneralization based on a single incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the incident, such as miscommunication or a misunderstanding between the employee and the soldier. The claim does not explore other possible reasons for the employee's behavior.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Spirit Airlines does offer certain benefits to military personnel, as mentioned in their website's statement about free checked bags and carry-ons for active duty military.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the airline's stance by stating that they \"don't cater to the military.\" While the claim mentions a lack of military discounts, it does not provide evidence to support the assertion that Spirit Airlines actively discriminates against military personnel.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of consistency and reliability, as it is based on social media posts and lacks official statements from Spirit Airlines or multiple sources to validate the incident."}
