{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the role of the TMC in starting the violence in Vidyasagar college. The claim presents the alleged account of a student and attributes the violence solely to TMC hooligans, without considering other possible factors or individuals involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on the account of one student and the Facebook post shared by Amit Malviya, without providing additional evidence or sources to support the claim. This lack of additional support weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the TMC is solely responsible for orchestrating the vandalization of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's bust and instigating the violence. This assumption overlooks the possibility of other individuals or groups being involved in the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the violence, such as the involvement of individuals wearing saffron-colored 'NaMo Again' t-shirts who were seen throwing stones and setting motorcycles on fire outside the campus. This alternative explanation suggests that the violence may not have been solely instigated by the TMC."}
