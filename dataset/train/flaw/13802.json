{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the statement that \"our country and Constitution was built on a foundational separation of church and state.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the concept of separation of church and state is a foundational principle of the country and Constitution, without providing clear evidence or arguments to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that the country and Constitution were built on a foundational separation of church and state, it acknowledges that there is no direct reference to this principle in the Constitution. This opens up the possibility of alternative explanations or interpretations of the relationship between church and state in the founding of the country.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing contradictory information. While it states that the phrase \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the Constitution, it also mentions that the concept is understood as a bedrock principle in American life.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and nuances of the relationship between church and state in the founding of the country. It simplifies the issue by stating that the country and Constitution were built on a foundational separation, without exploring other perspectives or historical contexts.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
