{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual statement made by Deanne Carson, as she did not explicitly say that parents should ask for consent to change diapers, but rather suggested that parents could ask children if it is okay to change their diapers as a way to teach them that their response matters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that Deanne Carson's advice is problematic or lacks reasoning skills.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by stating that Deanne Carson's advice implies that nonverbal infants can consent, which is a dangerous idea according to some readers. However, it is not clear if Deanne Carson actually made this implication.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Deanne Carson's statement, such as the possibility that she was emphasizing the importance of respecting a child's autonomy and teaching them about bodily autonomy from an early age."}
