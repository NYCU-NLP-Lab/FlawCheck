{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that monkeys are inside a hospital ward in India. The only evidence provided is a video shared on social media, which is later debunked as being from a hospital in South Africa.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of monkeys in a hospital ward is from India, without verifying the source or location.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is actually from a hospital in South Africa, as confirmed by the UK-based Daily Mail article and South Africa-based eNCA report.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that the monkeys are \"treating the patient\" and that the hospital has been taken over by monkeys.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that the video is not from India but from a hospital in South Africa.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately identifying the source and location of the video, as it is initially shared by a Pakistan-based reporter as being from India.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
