{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of sanctuary cities by stating that they released \"thousands upon thousands\" of illegal alien criminals and gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets and throughout the country. The evidence provided does not support such a large number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sanctuary cities are solely responsible for releasing dangerous criminals onto the streets, without considering other factors or the role of local authorities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Bob Casey specifically voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities. The evidence provided only mentions Casey's lack of support for a bill that would have cut federal grants to sanctuary cities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that sanctuary cities release dangerous criminals solely because ICE wants to deport them. The definition of sanctuary cities provided in the expert's verdict states that they won't hold individuals solely for immigration enforcement purposes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the release of criminals, such as potential administrative errors or other factors that may contribute to the releases."}
