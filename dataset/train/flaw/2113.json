{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difficulty for Christians to enter the United States as refugees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that it was impossible for Christians to enter the United States as refugees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there was discrimination against Christians in the refugee admission policy based on insufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The data suggests that the low proportion of Christian refugee admissions may be due to factors other than discriminatory policy."}
