{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton regularly directed her maid Marina Santos to print out classified material.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marina Santos lacked proper clearance to handle classified material, without providing clear evidence to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the New York Post article cited no source material directly, indicating that the claim may be unreliable or inconsistent.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may understate the significance of Marina Santos' involvement in handling sensitive emails, as it mentions that she was called on frequently and may hold important information.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no clear indication that Marina Santos was a maid or had access to necessarily classified material.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict raises the possibility that there may be alternative explanations for Marina Santos' involvement in printing out emails, such as administrative tasks or handling state secrets beyond classified material.", "Exaggerate": "It is difficult to determine if the claim exaggerates the extent of Marina Santos' involvement without further evidence, but the expert's verdict suggests that she was entrusted with handling state secrets, which could be seen as an exaggeration if not supported by solid evidence."}
