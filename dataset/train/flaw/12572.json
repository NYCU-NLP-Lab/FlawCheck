{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to establish a causal relationship between Democratic politics and the violence in cities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by connecting the overall politics of a city to its violent crime rates without considering other factors that contribute to crime.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the correlation between cities being more violent and skewing Democratic does not necessarily imply causation, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the higher crime rates.", "Contradict fact": "The expert points out that ranking cities based solely on FBI death stats, as done in the claim, goes against the FBI's warning and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of crime in a particular area.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Democratic politics on the violence in cities by making a broad and sweeping statement without considering the complexity of factors influencing crime rates.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of other variables, such as population demographics, socioeconomic factors, and law enforcement strategies, in determining crime rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying the relationship between politics and crime, ignoring the complexities and nuances involved in understanding crime patterns in cities."}
