{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children separated from their families under the Obama administration by stating that 72,410 children were separated in 2013 alone.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 72,410 number refers to the total number of unauthorized immigrants who were removed in 2013 that claimed at least one U.S.-born child, not specifically children separated from their families.", "Understate": "The claim understates the limited circumstances under which family separations occurred under previous administrations, suggesting that it was a widespread practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that 72,410 children were separated from their families under the Obama administration in 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of unauthorized immigrants removed with U.S.-born children automatically translates to the number of children separated from their families, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the number of unauthorized immigrants removed with U.S.-born children, such as suspicion of trafficking or other fraud."}
