{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"NAFTA allows a lot of trucks from Mexico...to drive straight through without even being inspected\" lacks enough support as there is evidence that implementation of the trade agreement has been bumpy and few trucks from Mexico currently travel outside of border commercial zones.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as there is conflicting information regarding the inspection of trucks from Mexico. While the claim suggests that trucks can drive through without inspection, there is evidence that a federal pilot project showed Mexico-domiciled motor carriers had safety records equal to or better than the national average for U.S. and Canadian motor carriers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that all trucks from Mexico are potentially dangerous. However, there is evidence that trucks from Mexico might not be safety threats in themselves and that only a handful of Mexico-based carriers currently haul cargo beyond the commercial zones along the border.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as it is stated that under \"cabotage\" regulations, a truck that originates in Mexico may drop off goods in the U.S. interior but can't also move goods solely within the U.S. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that few trucks from Mexico lately trundle outside of border commercial zones, indicating that the claim may not be accurate.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim."}
