{"Understate": "The claim states that health visitor numbers have fallen by 2,065 or 20% since October 2015. However, the expert's verdict confirms that the actual number of health visitors in December 2017 was 8,244, which is significantly lower than the peak number of 10,309 in October 2015. This suggests that the claim may be understating the extent of the decrease in health visitor numbers.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not provide any specific data or evidence to support the statement that health visitor numbers have fallen by 2,065 or 20% since October 2015. It simply presents this as a fact without any further explanation or context. This lack of supporting information may suggest that the claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "Similar to the previous point, the claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that health visitor numbers have decreased by 2,065 or 20% since October 2015. Without additional information or sources, it is difficult to determine the accuracy or reliability of this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decrease in health visitor numbers may be attributed to factors such as lower numbers of nurses from the EU joining the UK nursing register, an increase in EU staff leaving the NHS, and more staff leaving due to ill-health or work-life balance reasons. These alternative explanations suggest that there may be other factors influencing the decrease in health visitor numbers, which the claim does not consider."}
