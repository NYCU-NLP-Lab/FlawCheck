{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that Demand Protest LLC is paying $2500 for people to protest Donald Trump's inauguration. The evidence provided includes job ads on Backpage.com offering payment for protesters, but there is no direct confirmation or concrete proof of Demand Protest LLC's involvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of job ads on Backpage.com automatically proves that Demand Protest LLC is paying protesters. However, there could be alternative explanations for the ads, such as individuals or organizations unrelated to Demand Protest LLC seeking to hire protesters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the ads and the claims made by Demand Protest LLC. It questions the credibility of the website and raises doubts about the organization's ability to maintain \"absolute discretion\" while simultaneously posting ads on a publicly accessible platform.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Demand Protest LLC, as described on their website, claims to have organized 48 campaigns for seventeen different causes, despite being a relatively new organization. This raises doubts about the accuracy and credibility of their claims.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Demand Protest LLC's involvement in paying protesters for Donald Trump's inauguration. The evidence provided does not conclusively prove that the organization is behind the ads or that they are offering $2500 for protesting.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights inconsistencies and questionable aspects of Demand Protest LLC's claims and actions. This suggests that the organization may not be entirely reliable or consistent in their operations."}
