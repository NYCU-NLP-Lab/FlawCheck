{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting. However, the expert's verdict states that such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to demonstrate the feasibility or likelihood of postponing the election due to the pandemic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that alternative voting methods exist and questions whether the election could be delayed until pandemic-related restrictions had been eased, implying that there might be alternative solutions rather than postponing the election.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear explanation of how the election could be postponed and the implications it would have on the electoral process.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges and difficulties involved in postponing a presidential election, as the expert's verdict highlights the complexity and limited flexibility in changing the election date.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the date of a U.S. presidential election could only be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president, as stated in the expert's verdict."}
