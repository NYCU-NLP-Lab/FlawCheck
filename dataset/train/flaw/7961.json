{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the Democrats' plan by stating that they want to raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent, which is not supported by the available evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as none of the three Democratic candidates have released formal tax plans, and experts have stated that there is nothing to suggest tax rates as high as claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Democrats' plan includes raising tax rates to 70 or 80 percent without providing sufficient evidence or specific details from the candidates' proposals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by experts who suggest that the claim is more of a statement about the absence of a \"free lunch\" rather than an accurate representation of the Democrats' tax plans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no Democrat has offered a detailed tax plan with specific rates, let alone rates as high as claimed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making unsupported statements and not providing enough evidence to support the assertion of high tax rates.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim as it exaggerates the Democrats' plan rather than downplaying it."}
