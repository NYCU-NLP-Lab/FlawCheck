{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Donald Trump's actions on healthcare by stating that he sought to \"throw 32 million people off of the health care they had.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that not all of the 32 million people would be thrown off their insurance, as some would choose not to have insurance if the mandate penalty were removed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that President Trump sought to throw 32 million people off their healthcare. The expert's verdict highlights that the figure cited by Senator Bernie Sanders is a government estimate of what would happen if Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act without replacing it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that President Trump actively sought to remove healthcare coverage for 32 million people. The expert's verdict clarifies that the estimate of 32 million people becoming uninsured is based on a hypothetical scenario of repealing the ACA without a replacement, and it does not necessarily reflect President Trump's specific intentions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all 32 million people would be thrown off their insurance, as some would choose not to have insurance to avoid paying the penalty. The expert's verdict highlights that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) notes that some people would choose not to have insurance under the current law to avoid the penalty.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the complexities of the healthcare debate and the specific actions taken by President Trump. The expert's verdict clarifies that President Trump initially supported the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which sought partial repeal and replacement of the ACA, but also advocated for an immediate repeal of the ACA when that plan faltered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the potential decline in the number of insured individuals. The expert's verdict mentions that the estimate of 32 million people becoming uninsured is based on a hypothetical scenario of repealing the ACA without a replacement, but it does not explore other potential factors or alternative explanations."}
