{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of women who use birth control by stating that \"99% of women use birth control\" without providing specific evidence or data to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 99% of women use birth control. It only refers to a report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides estimates but does not specifically mention the 99% figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. Supreme Court's \"Hobby Lobby\" decision and the controversy surrounding it are relevant to the percentage of women using birth control. However, this assumption is not directly supported or explained.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide alternative explanations for the percentage of women using birth control. It solely focuses on the Supreme Court decision and its perceived impact on women's healthcare choices."}
