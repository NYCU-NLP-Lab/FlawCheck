{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that hospitals are getting paid more to list patients as COVID-19, which may be an exaggeration of the financial incentives involved.", "Understate": "The evidence indicates that the cases of COVID-19 are being undercounted, suggesting that the claim may be understating the actual number of cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that hospitals are intentionally inflating the count of COVID-19 patients for financial gain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hospitals have a financial incentive to falsely claim that a patient has COVID-19, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation that the illness is being underdiagnosed rather than over-identified, contradicting the claim made in the headline."}
