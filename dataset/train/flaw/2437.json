The expert's verdict mentions that none of the articles cited or linked to the original source of the Putin statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that GMOs and vaccines used by Western countries are intentionally slowing human evolution. This assumption is not supported by scientific evidence and is considered problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim is part of pro-Russian propaganda intended to appeal to individuals with anti-scientific views about vaccines and foods.
