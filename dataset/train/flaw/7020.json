{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"80 percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage\" lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The expert mentions that polling on this issue is inconsistent and there are various ways to ask the question, indicating a lack of clear and conclusive support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the diverse group of protesters at the rallies against HB2 were all in support of the living wage. The expert's verdict mentions that the protests included activists and supporters of various movements, not solely focused on the living wage. Therefore, it is a problematic assumption to attribute the support for the living wage to the entire crowd.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that the legislature and the governor would have been going against the majority of North Carolinians if they had opposed the living wage. However, there could be alternative explanations for their stance, such as different priorities, economic concerns, or differing opinions on the effectiveness of a higher minimum wage."}
