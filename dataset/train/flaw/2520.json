{"Exaggerate": "The claim states a wide range of 9 million to 50 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, which is considered an exaggeration compared to widely accepted estimates of around 11 million.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of undocumented immigrants by presenting a lower estimate of 9 million, which falls below the commonly cited figure of 11 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the given range of 9 million to 50 million undocumented immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim relies on an assumption made by a former fellow at Rice University's James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, which is not backed by a research presentation or solid evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or sources for estimating the number of undocumented immigrants, leading to uncertainty and potential bias."}
