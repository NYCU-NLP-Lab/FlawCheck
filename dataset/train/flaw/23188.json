{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the government shutdown by stating that \"only 15 percent of government spending is shut down.\" The expert's analysis suggests that the situation is more complex and that different categories of government spending are affected differently.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or explanation to support the statement that \"only 15 percent of government spending is shut down.\" The expert's analysis highlights the need to consider different measures of government and the specific categories of spending that are affected by a shutdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there are alternative ways to measure government and the impact of a shutdown, such as considering the federal workforce and different categories of spending. This implies that the claim may not fully consider these alternative explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of government spending that is shut down accurately represents the extent of the government shutdown. The expert's analysis points out that there are different categories of spending that are unaffected by the shutdown, which challenges this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the government shutdown by suggesting that 85 percent of government is still running. The expert's analysis indicates that the situation is more complex and that the impact on government services and activities can vary depending on the category of spending."}
