{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in deaths in fires by stating it as a 20% increase without providing the actual number of deaths in the previous year.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the decrease in the number of firefighters by only mentioning the reduction in all staff working for fire and rescue services, rather than specifically addressing the decrease in firefighters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a causal relationship between the decrease in firefighters and the increase in fire-related deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the number of firefighters is directly responsible for the increase in fire-related deaths, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in fire-related deaths, such as changes in fire safety regulations, population growth, or other societal factors."}
