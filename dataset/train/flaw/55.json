{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of taxpayer dollars spent on roadside signs to tout the economic stimulus. The expert's verdict states that the signs were not mandatory and some states chose not to use them, indicating that the spending may not be as significant as claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration is solely responsible for the signage, but the expert's verdict points out that the responsibility for carrying out stimulus efforts is largely delegated to the states. Therefore, the assumption that the administration is the primary actor in the signage drama is problematic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on the signs. The expert's verdict mentions critics and their statements, but no specific evidence or data is provided to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the signage, which is that it was not solely the administration's decision, but rather a recommendation from the U.S. Department of Transportation. This alternative explanation undermines the claim that the administration alone is responsible for the signage."}
