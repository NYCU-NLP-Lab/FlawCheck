{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the change in whistleblower rules by stating that the intelligence community \"secretly eliminated\" a requirement for firsthand knowledge, implying a significant change when there was not.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in whistleblower rules was specifically made to allow the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine to be filed, without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the change in whistleblower rules was directly related to the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the change in whistleblower rules, such as regular updates or revisions to improve the reporting process."}
