{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"4 million people protested against - CV scam, masks, governments breaking all Geneva conventions, vax, lockdowns, 5G and more in Berlin yesterday\" exaggerates the number of people and the breadth of the protest.", "Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows a crowd at an anti-coronavirus lockdown rally in Berlin contradicts the fact that the photo was taken in 2003 during the Love Parade music festival.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a false interpretation of the photo and does not provide any evidence to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo is recent and related to the anti-coronavirus lockdown rally in Berlin, which is a problematic assumption given the actual context of the photo.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo was taken during the Love Parade music festival in 2003, which is supported by the evidence of its origin and context."}
