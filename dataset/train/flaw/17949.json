{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows a protest by health department employees in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar over non-payment of their salaries in February 2019, rather than a protest on Eid al-Adha.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading video that does not accurately represent the situation it claims to depict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protest shown in the video is related to the revocation of Article 370 by the Indian government, which is a problematic assumption as there is no evidence to support this connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the protest shown in the video is unrelated to the revocation of Article 370 and is instead about the non-payment of salaries by the health department employees."}
