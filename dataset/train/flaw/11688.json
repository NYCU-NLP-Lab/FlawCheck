{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Fox viewers are consistently misinformed, as it states that \"every poll\" shows this to be true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Fox viewers are the most consistently misinformed media viewers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a Fox viewer automatically makes someone more misinformed compared to viewers of other media outlets, without considering other factors that may contribute to misinformation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Fox viewers may be perceived as more misinformed, such as the demographics of their viewership or the specific topics covered by the network.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its accuracy or validity, as it has been challenged and corrected by fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact and even acknowledged as false by Jon Stewart himself."}
