{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in illegal border crossings, stating a 173% increase from one year ago and a 28% increase since January. The actual increase may be significant, but the numbers provided are likely exaggerated.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of President Biden's policies on the border situation. While the expert acknowledges that there has been an increase in illegal border crossings, they argue that the description of the situation provided in the claim is off.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that President Biden's policies are solely responsible for the increase in illegal border crossings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Biden's actions, such as stopping the wall construction and deportations, directly caused the rise in illegal border crossings. However, experts suggest that the situation at the border is influenced by various factors and cannot be solely attributed to these actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts argue that the increase in illegal border crossings cannot be solely attributed to President Biden's policies, as there are other factors at play. The claim fails to acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
