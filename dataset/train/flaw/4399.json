{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in U.S. crude oil output since 2008, stating it as \"the fastest increase in U.S. history.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the statement of being the fastest increase in U.S. history.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in U.S. crude oil output is solely due to new means of extraction such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, without considering other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in U.S. crude oil output, such as changes in oil prices or external factors like hurricanes impacting production."}
