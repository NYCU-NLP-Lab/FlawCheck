{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more.\" The expert's analysis shows that this is not necessarily true and provides examples of states where the middle class would actually pay less under a graduated tax system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that the middle class always pays more under a graduated income tax system.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a graduated income tax system always results in the middle class paying more, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's analysis shows that the impact on the middle class can vary depending on the specific rates and brackets implemented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could influence the impact of a graduated income tax system on the middle class. The expert's analysis highlights that there are multiple factors to consider, such as the specific rates and brackets, as well as the definition of the middle class.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are states with graduated income tax systems where the middle class would actually pay less. The expert's analysis provides examples of states where a single filer making $59,000 would be taxed at a lower rate than in Illinois.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a broad statement without providing specific evidence or data. The expert's analysis points out the flaws in the claim's argument and highlights the lack of consensus on the definition of the middle class."}
