{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that the Texas Constitution still contains Jim Crow provisions about the poll tax and restrictions on women having the right to vote, but the expert's investigation found that the latest version of the constitution does not specifically reference the poll tax or women voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that the Texas Constitution still contains these provisions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Jim Crow provisions mentioned are still in effect in the Texas Constitution without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of certain language in the constitution, such as historical context or outdated sections that are no longer enforceable."}
