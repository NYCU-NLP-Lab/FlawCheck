{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which McCain hired \"some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington\" to run his campaign. The provided evidence mentions the presence of former lobbyists in the campaign, but it does not provide specific information about their influence or the scale of their involvement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that McCain hired \"some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington\" to run his campaign. The evidence provided only mentions the presence of former lobbyists in the campaign, but it does not provide detailed information about their roles or the extent of their influence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hiring former lobbyists automatically implies a close relationship with special interest influence. However, it does not consider alternative reasons for hiring former lobbyists, such as their expertise or experience in political campaigns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for McCain's decision to hire former lobbyists. It assumes that the sole reason for their hiring is to exert special interest influence, without considering other factors such as their political expertise or connections.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actions taken by the McCain campaign to address the issue of lobbyists. It mentions the implementation of a \"conflict policy\" and the departure of some lobbyists from the campaign, suggesting an effort to address the issue. However, the extent of these actions and their effectiveness in reducing lobbyist influence are not fully explored.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the issue. It jumps between different pieces of evidence and statements without fully examining their implications or providing a cohesive argument.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict. However, it may lack sufficient evidence to support its assertion about McCain hiring \"some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington\" to run his campaign."}
