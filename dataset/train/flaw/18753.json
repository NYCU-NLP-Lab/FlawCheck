More information is needed to determine the extent of his meaning and intentions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's statement is a general comment on his ability to get things done, without considering the specific context of the healthcare bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that President Trump's statement was specifically about the healthcare bill and not a broader statement about his ability to accomplish tasks."}
