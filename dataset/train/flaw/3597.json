{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that BJP workers were bribing people to attend Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's rally in Bengal. The video shared on social media does not provide clear proof of cash distribution by BJP workers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing BJP workers allegedly distributing cash during a previous rally in Jharkhand is related to the recent rally in Bengal. However, there is no direct evidence or connection established between the two events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the man wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \"\u0905\u092c\u0915\u093f \u092c\u093e\u0930 65 \u092a\u093e\u0930\" (Beyond 65 this time) in the video. It is possible that he is a supporter of the BJP or the slogan is being reused by different individuals or groups.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the video by not providing enough context or additional information to fully understand the situation. It fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of the rally or the motivations behind the alleged cash distribution.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict may falter at times in providing a clear analysis of the claim. The information provided is fragmented and lacks a cohesive evaluation of the biases present in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "No clear contradiction of facts is evident in the provided claim and expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "No clear exaggeration is evident in the provided claim and expert's verdict."}
