{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of apprehensions and arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border, as the expert's verdict highlights that the numbers are historically low.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California, as the expert's verdict mentions that border arrests may not be the best metric to evaluate migration to California.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that apprehensions and arrests at the border are directly indicative of the number of migrants entering California, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the decrease in apprehensions and arrests could be attributed to migrants crossing the Rio Grande and being apprehended in Texas, rather than entering California.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown agreed to deploy National Guard troops to the border, indicating a recognition of some level of migration issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the caveats and clarifications made by Gov. Jerry Brown in his letter to the Trump administration."}
