{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Wisconsin is one of only nine states where 17-year-olds are automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that treating 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system is inherently problematic or undesirable without providing further context or justification for this viewpoint.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may influence the treatment of 17-year-olds in the criminal justice system, such as the nature of the crimes committed or the potential for rehabilitation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wisconsin is no longer one of only nine states where 17-year-olds are automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system. Legislative changes have been made in recent years, and the National Conference of State Legislatures reports that the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is 17 in 47 states.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying it to a binary distinction between treating 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles in the criminal justice system. There may be nuanced approaches or variations within states' practices.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
