{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the percentage of funds that Scott Walker raises from out of state. The actual percentage is stated to be around 68-70%, but the claim presents it as nearly 70%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific sources or data to support the percentage mentioned. It only refers to Mary Burke's statement without providing additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising a significant portion of campaign funds from out of state is inherently negative or problematic, without providing any reasoning or context for why this may be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide any alternative explanations for why Scott Walker may be raising a large portion of his funds from out of state. It does not explore the possibility that Walker's policies or national profile may attract out-of-state donors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accurately representing the specific time period for which the percentage is applicable. It initially refers to the 2014 election cycle, but later clarifies that it refers to funds raised after the recall election in 2012.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the percentage of funds raised from out of state by rounding it down to nearly 70% instead of providing the precise figure of around 68%.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any known facts or evidence."}
