{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the administration opposed the sanctions being put in place on Iran. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the administration did have some opposition to the sanctions, but it is unclear if they were \"kicking and screaming all the way\" as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of Congress in pushing for the tough sanctions that forced Iran to the negotiating table. The expert's verdict provides evidence that it was Congress, not the Obama administration, that played a significant role in implementing the sanctions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the administration was strongly opposed to the sanctions being put in place on Iran. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there were differing views within the administration and that some individuals did oppose certain sanctions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that the administration was strongly opposed to the sanctions. The expert's verdict provides some evidence from lawmakers, but it does not directly address the administration's stance on the sanctions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by suggesting that there were differing views within the administration and that some individuals did oppose certain sanctions. This suggests that the claim may not provide a complete picture of the situation."}
