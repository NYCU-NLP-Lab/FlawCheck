{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kamala Harris jailed 1,500 Black men for marijuana possession. The actual number is disputed and the claim fails to provide enough evidence to support this specific number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence to back up the assertion that Kamala Harris withheld evidence on two Black men on Death Row and released the evidence after they were executed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kamala Harris's record as a prosecutor and her failure to intervene in cases involving police brutality make her unfit for the role of vice president, which is a subjective and problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the number of marijuana offense admissions during Kamala Harris's tenure as California state attorney general, as the California Public Safety Realignment Act resulted in a drop in admissions figures between 2011 and 2012.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no breakdown for marijuana offense admissions specifically by ethnicity and gender, as confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a correction made by the Washington Free Beacon and a fact check by the San Francisco Chronicle, which provide conflicting numbers for marijuana and hashish admissions during Kamala Harris's time as attorney general."}
