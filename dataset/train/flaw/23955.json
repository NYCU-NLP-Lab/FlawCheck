{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the economic growth of 6.3% is the highest recorded in the past 8 years. This could be an exaggeration if there were higher growth rates in the past.", "Understate": "The claim mentions that excise revenue has declined from 3% of GDP in 2003/04 to about 2% in 2017/18. This could be an understatement if the decline is actually more significant.", "Lack enough support": "The claim mentions the number of public entities registered in the portal and the value of contracts published, but it does not provide any further support or evidence for these figures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim states that Kenya has been ranked 85th globally in e-commerce uptake. However, there could be alternative explanations for this ranking, such as different methodologies used by different rankings or other factors influencing e-commerce uptake.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim compares Kenya's economic growth to the sub-Saharan Africa region average growth and the global average growth. This assumes that these comparisons are meaningful and relevant, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear which specific parts of the claim may falter at times without further context or analysis."}
