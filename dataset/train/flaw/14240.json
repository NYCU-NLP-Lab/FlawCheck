{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the candidate's involvement in saving the school year, as it suggests they negotiated with teachers to work for free, which is disputed by the teachers' union leaders.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the candidate negotiated with teachers to work for free, as the teachers' union leaders state that this only happened once in 2003, after the candidate had left the council.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the candidate's actions were the sole reason for saving the school year, without considering the contributions of other individuals or organizations involved in the process."}
