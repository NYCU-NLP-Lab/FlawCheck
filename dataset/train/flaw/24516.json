{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance under Obamacare, which may be an exaggerated figure based on the information provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a statement made by Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who refers to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. However, the CBO report does not explicitly state that 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people with employer-sponsored plans will decrease solely due to Obamacare, without considering other factors that may contribute to changes in coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The chart mentioned in the expert's verdict indicates that while there may be a decrease in employer-sponsored plans in some years, there is also a projected increase in other years. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for changes in coverage, not solely attributed to Obamacare."}
