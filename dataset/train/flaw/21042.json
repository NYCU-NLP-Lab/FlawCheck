The expert's verdict mentions that the images circulated on social media were of a generic religious flag, not Pakistan's national flag.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flags seen in the images are Pakistani flags without verifying their authenticity. This assumption is debunked by the expert's verdict, which explains that the flags are actually generic religious flags.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the presence of the flags, stating that they are commonly used as a religious symbol by the Muslim community.

The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this contradiction.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance and implications of the presence of the flags by suggesting that it is an \"alarm bell for Hindus.\" The expert's verdict does not support this exaggeration and instead provides a factual explanation for the flags.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at any point."}
