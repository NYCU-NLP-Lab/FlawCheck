{"Lack enough support": "The claim that camel-hunting is specifically prohibited by law in Arizona lacks sufficient support as it is not backed up by any evidence or reference to an actual law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a law prohibiting camel-hunting in Arizona, without providing any evidence or explanation for why such a law would exist.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that Arizona was once home to small herds of camels and that the law might have made sense at that time. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for the existence of such a law, rather than simply prohibiting an activity that is not native to the area.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no actual law prohibiting camel-hunting in Arizona, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the issue by simply stating that camel-hunting is prohibited by law, without considering the historical context and potential reasons for such a law.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a statement as a fact without providing any evidence or support for its validity. However, the expert's verdict does not falter and provides a more nuanced explanation."}
