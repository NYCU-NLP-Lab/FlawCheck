{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states that have legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The expert's verdict confirms that less than half of all states have such protections, but it does not provide an exact number or percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that LGBT Americans report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average. The expert's verdict mentions a 2005 Gallup Poll, but it does not provide more recent or comprehensive data on this specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that legal protections are the sole solution to employment discrimination against LGBT Americans. The expert's verdict mentions federal civil rights laws and other policies that prohibit discrimination, suggesting that there may be alternative avenues for addressing this issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict raises the question of whether employer behavior that discriminates against LGBT Americans is already prohibited under existing federal civil rights laws. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the reported employment discrimination and unemployment rates, such as lack of enforcement or awareness of existing protections."}
