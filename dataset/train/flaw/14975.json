{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Bill Gates adds a sterilization formula to every single vaccine for the last 10 years, without providing sufficient evidence to support this allegation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide concrete evidence or reliable sources to back up the accusation against Bill Gates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted in court that Bill Gates added a sterilization formula to vaccines, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the Gates Foundation spokesperson, who states that the foundation does not deliver vaccines and that organizations like the WHO, UNICEF, and local aid groups are responsible for vaccine delivery. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's accusation against Bill Gates."}
