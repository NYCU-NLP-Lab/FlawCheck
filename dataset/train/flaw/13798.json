{"Exaggeration": "The claim by President Trump that his administration has deported about half of MS-13 gang members may be an exaggeration, as there is no specific data available on the number of MS-13 gang members deported.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific data provided to back up the assertion that the administration is at the \"50 percent mark\" in deporting MS-13 gang members.", "Falters at times": "President Trump has made similar claims about deporting MS-13 gang members in the past, which have been questioned by experts. This suggests that his statements may falter at times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that deporting MS-13 gang members is an effective solution to eliminate the gang entirely, which may be a problematic assumption as the gang has grown into an international criminal organization with thousands of members worldwide.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the growth and presence of MS-13 gang members in the United States, such as the historical context of refugees from civil wars in Central America in the 1980s."}
