{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the government cleanup project on the beach in Manila Bay by stating that it is \"world-class after rehabilitation\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the photo indeed shows the beach in Manila Bay after the government cleanup project. The provided evidence includes a video from 2019 showing a different location, and the claim has been debunked by a Philippine news organization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the opposition Liberal Party is solely responsible for criticizing the Duterte government's actions regarding the Manila Bay cleanup project, without considering other possible perspectives or criticisms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as the possibility that it is not related to the government cleanup project but rather a different location or time."}
