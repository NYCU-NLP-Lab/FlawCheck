{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the image by implying that it is related to the ongoing farmers' protest, when in fact it is at least five years old.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or supporting information to prove that the Sikh man in the image attended a 'Kissan Rally' and forgot to remove his headgear.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Sikh man's agenda is anything but the welfare of the protesters, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the image, as it is stated that the image dates back to at least 2016 and is not related to the recent farmers' protests. This contradicts the claim's suggestion that the image is connected to the ongoing protests."}
