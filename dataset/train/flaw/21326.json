{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by stating that anyone making less than $15 an hour and working 40 hours a week is living below the poverty wage. The expert's verdict clarifies that not everyone earning less than $15 an hour would be below the federal poverty guidelines or lifted above the guidelines with $15-an-hour pay.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of workers who would be directly affected by increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. The expert's verdict mentions that the Congressional Budget Office estimates 17 million workers would be \"directly affected\" by the increase, but the number in poverty would decline by 900,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its statement that no one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage. The expert's verdict provides data on poverty guidelines and income levels but does not directly address the claim's assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a $15-an-hour wage is necessary to avoid living below the poverty wage for all workers. The expert's verdict highlights that workers earning between $11 and $13 an hour and in a family of four with no other income would still be below the poverty guidelines, but those earning $14 an hour would be above the federal poverty level for a family of four.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and additional context regarding the impact of raising the federal minimum wage to $15. It mentions that workers in states with higher thresholds, like Alaska and Hawaii, would still be below the poverty guidelines even if earning $14 or $15 an hour.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not everyone earning less than $15 an hour and working 40 hours a week would be living below the poverty wage. The expert's verdict clarifies that the number in poverty would decline by 900,000 if the federal minimum wage is increased to $15.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times based on the information provided."}
