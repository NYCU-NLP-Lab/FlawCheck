{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no direct statement from Marco Rubio stating his position on felons' voting rights and gun ownership after serving their time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marco Rubio holds contradictory views on felons' voting rights and gun ownership based on two separate quotes, but it does not provide any context or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the quotes presented in the claim, such as different contexts or timeframes in which they were made."}
