{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Gov. Rick Perry has been \"begging\" for the federal government to send the Coast Guard to patrol the lakes on the U.S.-Mexico border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Perry has been actively seeking federal assistance without providing concrete evidence or sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the situation, such as other efforts or strategies employed by the state of Texas to address border security issues, which are not mentioned in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Gov. Perry's actions or requests for federal assistance, as there is insufficient evidence to support the claim of him \"begging\" for Coast Guard help.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Lake Amistad, one of the lakes mentioned, has had no cartel-tied deaths, which undermines the urgency implied in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the border security issue and the efforts made by various agencies or entities to address it effectively."}
