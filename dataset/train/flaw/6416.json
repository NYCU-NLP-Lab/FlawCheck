{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Obama's welfare plan by stating that individuals wouldn't have to work or train for a job and that they would simply receive their welfare check.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's plan would eliminate work requirements for welfare recipients, which may be a problematic assumption as it oversimplifies the actual changes proposed by the plan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Obama's plan would completely remove work requirements and training for jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the changes proposed by Obama's plan, such as providing states with more flexibility to meet work requirements rather than completely eliminating them."}
