{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a real panda seated in the business class section of a jetliner.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viral image is genuine without providing any substantial proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the image may be fake or part of some type of act, casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Contradict fact": "The expert states that there is no record of a panda named Squee Squee in captivity, contradicting the claim's assertion of a real panda in the image.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility of the image being fake or staged by presenting it as a factual representation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the endangered status of giant pandas and the monitoring of their whereabouts, which makes it unlikely for a panda to be traveling in the business class section of an airplane."}
