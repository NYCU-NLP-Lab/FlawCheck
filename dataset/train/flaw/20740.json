{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to verify its accuracy. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the image is from 2016 and the man in the image is a law professor helping a student, not the father of the child. This contradicts the claim made in the viral post.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the professor is the father of the child based on the image, but the expert's verdict clarifies that this is not the case. The assumption made in the claim is therefore problematic and incorrect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that the professor was helping a student by carrying her child so that she could attend the lecture without interruption. This alternative explanation contradicts the assumption made in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the professor is not the father of the child, as clarified by the expert's verdict. The claim falsely assumes that the professor is the father based on the image.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of a faltering bias in the provided claim."}
