{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Hillary Clinton erased her emails, as it implies that she erased all of them, even though she preserved and delivered thousands to the State Department.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Hillary Clinton erased all of her emails, as it is based on Mitt Romney's statement without providing any additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of Hillary Clinton's emails were subject to recall and review by Congress, which may be a problematic assumption as not all records need to be retained and agencies have the discretion to delete material deemed to have no value.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for why Hillary Clinton chose to use a private email account, such as convenience or personal preference, which are not addressed in the claim."}
