{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of putting millions of dollars into the rainy day fund in consecutive years, implying that it has never happened before in state history.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the policies are solely responsible for the consecutive deposits into the rainy day fund.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the consecutive deposits into the rainy day fund are solely attributable to the governor's policies, without considering other factors or external circumstances that may have contributed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation by pointing out that previous deposits were made into the fund under a different governor's term, suggesting that it is not the first time in state history."}
