{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Rajput women with swords were opposing Muslim women from Shaheen Bagh and Clock Tower. The video shows Rajput women waving swords, but there is no evidence to support the claim that they were opposing Muslim women specifically from those locations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or additional information provided to verify the claim. The video itself does not provide any context or explanation for the actions of the Rajput women.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Rajput women were opposing Muslim women from Shaheen Bagh and Clock Tower without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption. It is a problematic assumption as it generalizes the actions of a few individuals to represent an entire group.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the video, such as a cultural or traditional event where Rajput women were showcasing their sword skills. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and jumps to the conclusion that the Rajput women were opposing Muslim women.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the viral video is false and an attempt to drive up propaganda against the anti-CAA protest. The claim presents a distorted version of events, contradicting the fact that there was no opposition between Rajput women and Muslim women at Shaheen Bagh and Clock Tower.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in this claim."}
