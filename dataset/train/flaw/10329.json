{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in protective gear between Robin Vos and other election workers. While Vos is shown wearing a mask, gloves, and a protective gown, it is mentioned that some poll workers across the state only had access to masks and gloves.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that election workers forced to work did not have equivalent protection. It is mentioned that the City of Burlington provided workers at its polling site with the same gear that Vos wore, but it is acknowledged that many poll workers across the state did not have the same level of protection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Robin Vos forced election workers to work without adequate protection, but there is no clear evidence provided to support this assumption. It is mentioned that Vos volunteered to work at a polling site after many poll workers stayed home, but it is not explicitly stated that he forced anyone to work.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the availability of protective gear varied across different polling sites and regions in Wisconsin, rather than being solely determined by Robin Vos. The claim does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the distribution of protective equipment."}
