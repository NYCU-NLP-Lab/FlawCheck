{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of scrutiny and evaluation that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) went through before it was voted on by the House. The expert's verdict states that the bill had not yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) when it was voted on, contradicting the claim's implication that it had been scored twice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify its statement that the AHCA went through four committees before the House voted on it. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or confirmation of this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that going through four committees and being scored by the CBO is sufficient scrutiny for a healthcare bill. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the CBO had not yet scored the current version of the bill when it was voted on, indicating that the level of scrutiny may not have been adequate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim's implication that the AHCA had undergone thorough evaluation before the House vote. It suggests that the bill had not yet been scored by the CBO and raises doubts about the predictability of its impact."}
