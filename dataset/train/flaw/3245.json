{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the extent of the issue by stating that only five states prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that install solar panels. The expert's verdict mentions that at least 24 states allow third-party solar agreements, indicating a larger number of states with restrictions on direct sale of solar energy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that Florida is one of only five states that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that install solar panels. The evidence provided is based on a map from the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy, but no further details or sources are provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Florida is out of touch with the majority of states on solar energy, without providing clear evidence or comparison to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that Florida ranks third in solar capacity but 13th in installations, but it does not directly address the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the restriction on buying electricity from companies that install solar panels in Florida. The expert's verdict mentions that Florida law only allows a few utilities to sell power directly to consumers, suggesting that there may be regulatory or economic factors influencing the restriction.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the issue of restrictions on buying electricity from companies that install solar panels. The expert's verdict confirms that Florida is one of the states that prohibit such agreements.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any specific points or provide inconsistent information."}
