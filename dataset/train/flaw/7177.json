{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Barack Obama received more campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. The expert's verdict clarifies that Obama is actually second on the list, with Senator Chris Dodd being the top recipient.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to substantiate the statement. The expert's verdict provides the source of the information, which is the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, but it does not provide any further details or specific numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are indicative of a close relationship or influence. However, the expert's verdict provides additional information that Fannie and Freddie-related contributors gave more money to John McCain than to Barack Obama.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by mentioning that corporations cannot give directly to candidates, so the contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees and their families are added up. It also highlights that Obama received more money from other companies, such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Jim Johnson, the former CEO of Fannie Mae, resigned from his unpaid position advising Obama on his vice presidential choice before Joe Biden was selected as the vice presidential nominee. This contradicts the claim that Johnson was put in charge of Obama's vice presidential search.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times."}
