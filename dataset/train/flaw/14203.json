{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that there has been \"zero warming\" for the last 17 years based on satellite data. The expert's verdict states that while there hasn't been significant warming, it is misleading to assume this trend will continue indefinitely.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only references satellite data without considering other factors or sources of temperature measurements. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is countered by the scientific mainstream.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of significant warming over the past 17 years negates the long-term likelihood of global warming. The expert's verdict states that this assumption is misleading and that short-term trends do not negate the overall likelihood of global warming.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the lack of significant warming over the past 17 years, such as the influence of El Ni\u00f1o events. The expert's verdict mentions that the outlier year of 1998, which had a strong El Ni\u00f1o, affected global temperatures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 14 hottest years on record have occurred since the peak in 1998, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The claim's assertion of \"zero warming\" contradicts this information.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential impact of global warming by focusing solely on the lack of significant warming over the past 17 years. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim fails to consider the long-term likelihood of global warming.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively using satellite data to support its argument while disregarding other sources of temperature measurements. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is lacking in support and counters the scientific mainstream."}
