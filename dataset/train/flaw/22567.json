{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ActBlue is a nonprofit organization that passes along donations to organizations that use its fundraising platform, rather than pocketing the money itself.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Black Lives Matter, ActBlue, and Democrat candidates by stating that all money donated to Black Lives Matter goes directly to ActBlue and then to Democrat candidates, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its assertion that all money donated to Black Lives Matter goes to ActBlue and then to Democrat candidates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ActBlue is a Democrat Super PAC, which is not accurate. ActBlue is a nonprofit technology organization that provides a platform for fundraising for Democratic campaigns and causes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that ActBlue is simply a platform for fundraising, similar to platforms used by Republican candidates, and it passes along donations to the organizations that request them."}
