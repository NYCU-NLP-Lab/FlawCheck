{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Ted Cruz's involvement in banning dildos by stating that he \"tried to ban dildos\" while serving as solicitor general of Texas. The expert's verdict clarifies that Cruz's office defended an existing law banning the sale of \"obscene devices\" but did not personally support or attempt to ban dildos.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the case and the battle concerning privacy and free-speech rights that Ted Cruz was involved in. The expert's verdict highlights the importance of the case as it challenged a Texas law criminalizing the sale of dildos.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by incorrectly stating that Ted Cruz tried to ban dildos, which is contradicted by the expert's verdict. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate account of Cruz's involvement in defending an existing law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that Ted Cruz tried to ban dildos. The expert's verdict provides evidence and legal cases to support their conclusion that Cruz did not personally support or attempt to ban dildos.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ted Cruz's defense of an existing law banning the sale of \"obscene devices\" equates to him trying to ban dildos. The expert's verdict clarifies that the law included a broader definition, and Cruz's involvement was in defending the law, not specifically targeting dildos.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for Ted Cruz's involvement in defending the law banning the sale of \"obscene devices.\" However, the expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation by highlighting the battle concerning privacy and free-speech rights in the case."}
