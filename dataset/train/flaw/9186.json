It does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting attendance records are the sole indicator of effective representation in Washington, which may be a problematic assumption as there are other factors that contribute to effective representation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in voting attendance records between Harry Reid and the three Congressmen, such as differences in legislative responsibilities or committee assignments, which are not addressed in the claim."}
