{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that all the photos were taken after Typhoon Hagibis in October 2019, when in reality, five of the photos were taken after Typhoon Etau in September 2015.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cleanliness and clearness of the floodwaters in Japan after Typhoon Hagibis, stating that they are \"clear as pool water\" and without any trash.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a Facebook post with photos and a caption, without any additional evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cleanliness and clearness of the floodwaters in Japan after Typhoon Hagibis are due to the discipline of Japanese people, without considering other factors such as infrastructure or government response.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cleanliness and clearness of the floodwaters, such as the possibility of photo manipulation or selective editing."}
