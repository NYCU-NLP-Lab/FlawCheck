{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of major water storage projects that have been completed since the 1970s, as there have been some significant storage projects constructed in the 1990s and a large ocean desalination plant built in San Diego County two years ago.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively state that no major water storage projects have been completed since the 1970s. While the construction of the State Water Project and the Central Valley Water Project occurred mainly in the 1960s or earlier, there is evidence of regional water districts constructing significant storage projects in the 1990s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the completion of a single major water storage project is necessary for California's population growth and future thriving. It may be problematic to assert that inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years ago is the sole factor hindering growth and prosperity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of major water storage projects built since the 1970s. It does not explore potential reasons for the delay or alternative solutions that may have been implemented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that regional water districts constructed several significant storage projects in the 1990s and a large ocean desalination plant was built in San Diego County two years ago. This contradicts the statement that no major storage projects have been completed since the 1970s.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of major water storage projects built since the 1970s by not considering the regional projects in the 1990s and the recent ocean desalination plant construction. It presents a more dire picture than the actual situation."}
