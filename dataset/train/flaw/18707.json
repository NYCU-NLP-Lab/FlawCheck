{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential increase in utility bills, stating that it could be as high as $500 a year, while the actual estimate from the study is $464.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to directly link Patrick Murphy's support for the Clean Power Plan to the potential increase in utility bills.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Murphy wants utility bills to go up because he supports the Clean Power Plan, without considering alternative motivations or reasons for his support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the potential increase in utility bills, such as changes in energy prices or other factors not directly related to Murphy's actions or policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Murphy has little to do with the Clean Power Plan and therefore cannot be solely responsible for any potential increase in utility bills."}
