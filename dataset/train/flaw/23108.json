{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"21,000 DEAD PEOPLE\" registered to vote in Pennsylvania exaggerates the number of deceased voters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a lawsuit filed by a conservative organization that failed to convince a federal judge of the accuracy of its list.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of deceased voters on the registration rolls indicates widespread voter fraud, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The judge in the case pointed out that the discrepancy in the list of deceased voters could be due to inadequacies in the organization's data-mining procedures or efforts by the state and county to remove ineligible voters, suggesting alternative explanations."}
