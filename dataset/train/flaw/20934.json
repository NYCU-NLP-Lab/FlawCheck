{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of jobs added by the Trump administration to Pennsylvania over the last three years. The expert's verdict states that the growth hasn't been as robust as claimed by Vice President Mike Pence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the job growth in Pennsylvania under the Trump administration.
