While the expert's verdict provides evidence that supports the claim, it is possible that there may be additional information or factors that were not considered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that Jeb Bush had complete control over the decision of which private emails to disclose. The expert's verdict mentions that Florida's open records law allows elected officials to hand-select the emails they make available to the public, but it also suggests that there may be more to the process than just self-reporting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for why Jeb Bush decided which private emails to disclose. The expert's verdict mentions that the emails posted on Bush's website were selected from messages already available from the state archives, and that not all of his emails were included. This suggests that there may be other factors, such as the availability of archived emails, that influenced the selection process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any established facts based on the information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information based on the information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at times based on the information provided in the expert's verdict."}
