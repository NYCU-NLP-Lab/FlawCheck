{"Exaggerate": "The claim of increasing adoptions by 135 percent is seen as an exaggeration by the expert. They mention that reaching this number requires some serious calculator gymnastics.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of the claim understating any information.", "Falters at times": "The expert points out that Giuliani's wording suggests he took an active role in reducing abortions, which contradicts his record as an abortion-rights mayor. This shows that the claim falters in accurately representing Giuliani's stance on abortion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that they couldn't find any research showing a direct link between an increase in adoptions and a decrease in abortions. This suggests that the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert highlights that the claim assumes a connection between the rise in adoptions and the decline in abortions, even though the Giuliani campaign later stated that they are not linking the two. This assumption is seen as problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the decrease in abortions and increase in adoptions during Giuliani's tenure, such as the creation of the Administration for Children's Services."}
