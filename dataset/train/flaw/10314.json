{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the sheriff has asked for additional resources or budget increases beyond inflationary levels. The expert questions whether the sheriff has consistently confined himself to asking for inflationary increases every year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to demonstrate that the sheriff has never asked for more than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets. The expert mentions the need to examine the numbers and county records to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sheriff has always been satisfied with the money given in the previous year's budget and has never requested additional resources. This assumption may be problematic as it does not account for potential changes in circumstances or needs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for any budget cuts or reductions proposed by the successor to the Milwaukee County Executive. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and instead attributes them solely to the successor's disdain for law and order and desire to gut the Sheriff's Department."}
