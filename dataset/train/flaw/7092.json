{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of green card holders serving in the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan by stating that there are \"a few thousand\" when the actual number provided by the Pentagon is 4,112.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that there are \"a few thousand\" green card holders serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. It only mentions that the information was obtained from the Defense Department.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all noncitizens serving in the U.S. military are green card holders, which may not be entirely accurate as there were 2,236 individuals whose citizenship status was \"unknown\" according to the Pentagon report.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why noncitizens serve in the U.S. military, such as the citizenship incentives and benefits provided to immigrants who enlist.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are 4,112 green card holders serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, not \"a few thousand\" as stated.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the contributions and sacrifices made by noncitizens serving in the U.S. military by referring to them as \"a few thousand\" and not highlighting their significant role.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not consistently provide accurate information, as it initially states that the video was released as a web ad on Memorial Day, but later mentions that it was also released as a national television ad."}
