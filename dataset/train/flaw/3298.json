{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Wisconsin has become less safe than when Scott Walker took office, as it does not provide specific data or statistics to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Wisconsin has become less safe under Scott Walker's leadership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Scott Walker is solely responsible for any increase in violent crime in Wisconsin, without considering other factors such as demographics, rates of incarceration, or police misreporting offenses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for fluctuations in the incidence of crime, such as local factors or the responsibility of local police and sheriff's departments.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and specific timeframe for the comparison, as it only cites the \"nearly four years\" since Walker took office and does not provide data for the entire duration of his term.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wisconsin's violent crime rate declined each year from 2007 through 2011, Walker's first year in office, before increasing in 2012.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of other factors on fluctuations in the incidence of crime, such as demographics, rates of incarceration, or police misreporting offenses."}
