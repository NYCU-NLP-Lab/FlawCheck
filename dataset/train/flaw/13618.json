{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the travel restrictions by stating that if you travel outside of the United States starting in March, you won't be allowed back in the country due to the high risk of the coronavirus. The expert's verdict clarifies that there is currently no sweeping travel restriction that would bar an American citizen from re-entering the U.S. after traveling internationally.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence of a sweeping travel restriction mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a high risk of the coronavirus for travelers outside of the United States without providing any evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by mentioning the new screening procedures, travel advisories, and different rules for foreign nationals as measures taken by the U.S. government to address concerns about COVID-19."}
