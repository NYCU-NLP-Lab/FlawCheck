{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Walmart's pledge by stating that they have pledged $100 million specifically to Black Lives Matter, when in fact the money is pledged to create a racial equity center that will support various initiatives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Walmart has pledged $100 million to Black Lives Matter.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $100 million pledge by Walmart is directly going to Black Lives Matter, without considering the possibility that the funds may be allocated to other organizations or initiatives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Walmart's pledge is not specifically targeted towards Black Lives Matter, but rather towards creating a racial equity center.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that Walmart's pledge is a broader commitment to racial equity and not solely focused on supporting the Black Lives Matter organization."}
