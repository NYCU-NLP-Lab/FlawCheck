{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a majority of write-in ballots for Trump would elect him to the U.S. Senate or undermine Republican candidates. This assumption may not be supported by evidence or may overlook other factors that could affect the election outcome.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that write-in ballots for Trump would have a significant impact on the election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that write-in ballots for Trump would likely be considered invalid since there is no official space for write-in candidates in the runoffs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Georgia law only allows two candidates per race on ballots in runoffs, and Trump was not one of them in the Jan. 5 election. Therefore, he has no legal avenue to secure a Senate seat in this election.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and supported argument for how write-in ballots for Trump would impact the election outcome.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of write-in ballots for Trump by suggesting that they could elect him to the U.S. Senate or undermine Republican candidates without sufficient evidence or support.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim."}
