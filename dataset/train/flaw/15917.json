{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that reporters rehearse questions with the White House press secretary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by the reporter, Catherine Anaya, accurately represents the overall process of press briefings, which is later contradicted by both Jay Carney and Anaya herself.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the process of press briefings by simplifying it to reporters rehearsing questions, which may not accurately reflect the full extent of the preparation and interaction involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times due to the conflicting statements and corrections made by the involved parties, including Anaya's initial confusion and subsequent clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations for the reported statement by Anaya, such as misunderstanding or miscommunication, rather than deliberate rehearsal of questions."}
