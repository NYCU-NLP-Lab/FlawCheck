{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the involvement of the MP government in making women sell liquor. The government's decision to run liquor stores does not necessarily mean that they are directly forcing women to sell liquor.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that making women sell liquor is a shameful decision that goes against women's dignity, safety, and honor. This assumption may be subjective and based on societal norms and beliefs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the government's decision is shameful or against women's dignity, safety, and honor. It relies on emotional language and opinions expressed by individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative reasons for the government's decision to run liquor stores, such as economic factors or the need to ensure the availability of essential goods during the coronavirus outbreak."}
