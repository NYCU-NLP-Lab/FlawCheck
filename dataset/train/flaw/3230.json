{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that coiled mattresses cause cancer by amplifying radio waves, which is based on a speculative hypothesis from a study that suggests a correlation between sleeping on the left side of a coil-spring mattress and increased exposure to electromagnetic radiation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that coiled mattresses directly cause cancer by amplifying radio waves. The study mentioned in the expert's verdict only presents a speculative hypothesis and does not provide concrete data or conclusive findings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual findings of the study it is based on. The Scientific American blog post misinterpreted the study's conclusion and incorrectly stated that coil-spring mattresses amplify electromagnetic radiation, while the study actually suggested that the metal coils in mattresses attenuate the waves.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the reasons for the correlation between left-sided cancer and coil-spring mattresses remain unclear. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors involved that have not been considered or explored in the claim."}
