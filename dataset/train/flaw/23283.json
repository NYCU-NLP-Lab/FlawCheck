{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the people in the image are \"the actual people from that meme, 10 years later!\" when in fact they are not the same people.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or proof to support the assertion that the people in the image are the same as the ones in the original meme.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the people in the image are the same as the ones in the original meme without any evidence or confirmation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Charlie Todd, who claims to be the man in the copycat photo and explains that it was taken at a \"Know Your Meme\" party at the Museum of the Moving Image in NYC, which contradicts the claim that the people in the image are the same as the ones in the original meme."}
