{"Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that Obama's claim of winning twice as many states is slightly off, as he had actually won nearly twice as many states. This suggests that Obama may have downplayed his success in this aspect.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the popular vote totals from some states, including Iowa, Nevada, Washington, and Maine, were not available. This lack of complete data could undermine the support for Obama's claim of winning a greater share of the popular vote.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights the issue of including or excluding the results from Michigan and Florida, which were in a state of limbo due to defying the DNC schedule. This raises a problematic assumption in Obama's claim, as the inclusion or exclusion of these states significantly affects the popular vote comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton would be ahead of Obama if Michigan is included in the popular vote count. This suggests that there is an alternative explanation to Obama's claim, depending on the inclusion or exclusion of certain states' results."}
