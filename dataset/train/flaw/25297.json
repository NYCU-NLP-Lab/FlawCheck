{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which immigrant children were placed with human traffickers during the Obama administration. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a 2015 criminal case and a 2016 Senate report, which may not provide a comprehensive picture of the overall situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a specific criminal case and Senate report, which may not be representative of the entire Obama administration's policies and practices regarding immigrant children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the placement of immigrant children with human traffickers was a widespread and intentional practice during the Obama administration. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the reports criticizing Obama were a response to the public outcry over Trump's \"zero tolerance\" policy, indicating a potential bias in assuming a direct link between the two administrations' actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the placement of immigrant children with human traffickers, such as potential failures or gaps in the vetting process or the actions of individual actors within the system. The expert's verdict mentions that basic checks were neglected, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind such neglect.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear distinction between the actions of the Obama administration and those of individual actors involved in human trafficking. The expert's verdict mentions a criminal case involving a human trafficking ring, but it does not explicitly attribute the actions to the Obama administration itself.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actions taken by the Obama administration regarding the placement of immigrant children with human traffickers. The expert's verdict acknowledges that the administration did place some children with human traffickers, based on a Senate report, but it does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the scale or significance of these incidents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the \"left-leaning media stayed strangely silent\" about the case. The expert's verdict highlights that the case has been thoroughly reported on by local and national outlets and is the subject of a PBS documentary film, indicating that the claim is not accurate in its portrayal of media coverage."}
