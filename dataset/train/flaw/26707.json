{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans with sexually transmitted illnesses by stating that 110 million Americans have such illnesses, which is a significant overestimate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that 110 million Americans have sexually transmitted illnesses.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the entire U.S. population was roughly 309 million in 2012, according to the Census Bureau, making it highly unlikely that over one-third of Americans have a sexually transmitted illness.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC statistic mentioned by Phil Robertson is accurate and applies to the entire U.S. population without questioning or verifying the data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the CDC's use of the 110 million figure, such as including both new and existing infections and not specifically referring to the number of Americans affected."}
