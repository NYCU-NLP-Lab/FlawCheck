The credibility of these sources is not established, and there is no additional evidence provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Lt. Col. Vindman's firing was solely due to his testimony against President Trump.

Col. Vindman's firing is suggested by National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien's statement about streamlining the National Security Council.
