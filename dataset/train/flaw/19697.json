{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the danger posed by the spider by stating that it has a lethal bite that killed five people in the summer of 2018, when in fact, the spider's bites are virtually innocuous and not fatal to humans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the spider has a lethal bite and caused deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spider is new to the U.S., when in fact, it is not new and has been found in various regions of the country.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific studies and reliable sources that state the spider's bites are not fatal and cause only minor pain.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the possibility that the reported deaths may have been caused by other factors or unrelated incidents, rather than the spider's bite."}
