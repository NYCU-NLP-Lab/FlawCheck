{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which ExxonMobil paid no federal income taxes and received a $156 million rebate. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is taken out of context and that ExxonMobil actually paid more than $500 million in U.S. income tax expense in 2009.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that ExxonMobil paid no federal income taxes and received a $156 million rebate. The expert's verdict provides information from ExxonMobil and a tax professor to counter the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the figures from ExxonMobil's \"10-K\" form represent the actual income taxes paid to the government, which is not necessarily the case. The expert's verdict highlights that the figures on the form may not reflect the company's actual tax payments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The negative figure of \"- $156 million\" listed as the company's U.S. income tax figure for 2009 is explained by ExxonMobil as a tax credit obtained due to overpayments in previous years. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that it represents a rebate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ExxonMobil did pay income taxes in 2009, as confirmed by the company and the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "It is unclear if the claim understates any information or facts, as the focus is more on exaggeration and lack of support.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or context to support the assertion that ExxonMobil paid no federal income taxes and received a $156 million rebate. The expert's verdict highlights the flaws in the claim and provides additional information to clarify the situation."}
