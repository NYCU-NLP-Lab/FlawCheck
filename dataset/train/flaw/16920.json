{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the studies mentioned in the claim did not investigate how the virus spreads from person to person in public settings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that presymptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients do not spread the virus in any setting, without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that were not considered in the claim, as the studies only focused on transmission within households and not in public settings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that presymptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can indeed spread the virus, as acknowledged by the World Health Organization and other health authorities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the scope and objectives of the research, as the studies did not support the claim's assertion about transmission in public settings.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of social distancing and other preventive measures in public spaces, as it suggests that such measures are unnecessary based on the assumption that symptomatic patients would stay home."}
