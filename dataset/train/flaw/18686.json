{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential wage that would be earned if the minimum wage was indexed to inflation, stating that people would be making $20 an hour right now, when in reality it would be significantly lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that people would be making $20 an hour if the minimum wage was indexed to inflation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that indexing the minimum wage to inflation is the only factor that would determine the current wage, without considering other economic factors or policies that could affect wages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that if the minimum wage had been indexed to worker productivity, it would be at $20 an hour today. This suggests that there are alternative methods of equalizing the minimum wage across time."}
