{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years, which implies an exceptionally rapid decline.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides a comparison between the deficit percentages of GDP in 2009 and 2012. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the deficit trends over the entire 60-year period.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not consider the relative size of the decline in the deficit, which could provide a different perspective on the rate of decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in deficits, such as external factors or policies implemented by previous administrations."}
