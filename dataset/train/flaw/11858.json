{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Tammy Baldwin \"wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!\"", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that the group making the claim, Restore American Freedom and Liberty, did not provide any evidence or information to back up their attack on Baldwin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Tammy Baldwin is an openly gay U.S. senator, she wants to require children to learn about gay sex, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the attack on Baldwin may be part of an effort to draft conservative Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to run against her in the 2018 election."}
