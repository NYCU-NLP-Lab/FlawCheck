{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration by calling McCaskill's actions \"giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants.\" The experts mentioned that the bill in question did provide a pathway to citizenship, but it is debatable whether it can be considered amnesty.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that joining \"the liberals\" in Washington for the bill equates to giving amnesty to illegal immigrants. However, the experts highlight that the term \"amnesty\" is subjective and can be heavily criticized.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that McCaskill specifically joined liberals for the purpose of granting amnesty. The ad only mentions her vote in favor of a bill that included a pathway to citizenship.", "Alternative explanation": "The experts provide an alternative explanation by stating that the bill was not necessarily amnesty but rather a comprehensive immigration reform effort. They also mention the comparison to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by a Republican president and provided a chance for unauthorized immigrants to apply for citizenship."}
