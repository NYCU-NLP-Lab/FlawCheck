{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of students who attempt suicide every year on college campuses. The expert's verdict states that the claim is based on data from the American College Health Association, which found that about 1.2 percent of college students reported attempting suicide within the past 12 months. However, the claim presents this percentage as the number of students, resulting in an inflated figure of 200,000 suicide attempts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough support or evidence to back up the statement that 200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses. It relies on a survey conducted by the American College Health Association, but the specific data and methodology are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if students had firearms, more of these suicide attempts would be lethal. However, this is an assumption and lacks evidence to support it."}
