{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that 7,000 new affordable housing units have been created since the mayor took office. However, the expert's verdict provides data from the Department of City Development that shows a total of 7,261 affordable housing units had been developed since the mayor took office, which supports the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a clear definition of what qualifies as an \"affordable housing unit.\" It is unclear if the claim includes all types of affordable housing units, such as apartments, single-family homes, or duplexes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated if it includes all types of affordable housing units, including those that were not directly created by the city government but rather through partnerships with real estate groups or organizations like Habitat for Humanity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the creation of affordable housing units is the sole responsibility or achievement of the mayor. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Barrett has faced criticism for focusing on apartment units instead of single-family homes or duplexes, suggesting that the approach to affordable housing may not solely be attributed to the mayor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the creation of affordable housing units in Milwaukee. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the city has been bulldozing derelict housing units while simultaneously adding affordable housing units, suggesting that the increase in affordable housing may be due to a combination of new construction and demolitions."}
