{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the tax reform bill on the personal casualty deduction for losses from wildfires and natural disasters. While it mentions that the deduction would be eliminated or severely curtailed, the expert's verdict suggests that the deduction would no longer be available or only have limited use going forward.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the extent of the impact on the personal casualty deduction. The expert's verdict provides some information, but it may not be sufficient to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax reform bill calls for eliminating or severely curtailing the personal casualty deduction for losses from wildfires and natural disasters. However, the expert's verdict indicates that there were differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, with the Senate version proposing to limit the deduction to losses incurred in federally declared disasters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the provisions in the tax reform bill. The expert's verdict mentions that the deduction was criticized during the devastating wildfires in southern California, but it does not explore other possible reasons or motivations behind the proposed changes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that victims of the December 2017 wildfires would still be able to use the personal casualty deduction if they can assess damages in time. The claim suggests that the deduction would be eliminated or severely curtailed, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it would still be available for those specific victims.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the tax reform bill on the personal casualty deduction. While it states that the deduction would be eliminated or severely curtailed, the expert's verdict mentions that the Senate version of the bill would still keep the deduction, albeit with limitations."}
