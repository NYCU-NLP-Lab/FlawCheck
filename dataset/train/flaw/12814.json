{"Understate": "The claim understates the annual growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States by stating that it is not the \"strongest\" compared to other countries, despite the U.S. having a higher growth rate than Europe, Japan, and Latin America.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that China had a higher GDP growth rate than the United States in 2015, indicating that the U.S. economy is not the strongest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the U.S. economy has the \"first sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s,\" as it fails to provide sufficient evidence or data to back up this assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by stating that manufacturing employment has rebounded since 2010, but fails to acknowledge that it is still below pre-recession levels and has experienced a decline in 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Affordable Care Act is responsible for keeping employer-sponsored health care costs down, without providing enough evidence or considering other factors that may contribute to this outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the growth in manufacturing employment, such as factors outside of Obama's economic agenda that may have contributed to the rebound."}
