{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the simplification of the tax form, suggesting that it will be \"very, very different\" and \"much easier\" without providing enough evidence to support these claims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to demonstrate that the tax form will be significantly simplified.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new tax form will be a single page or a \"card,\" which is not supported by the new law or current options for filing taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the simplification mentioned by Trump refers to increases in the standard deduction and the curtailment of the alternative minimum tax, rather than a complete overhaul of the tax form."}
