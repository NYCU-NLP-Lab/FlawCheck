{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Antifa is to blame for storming the U.S. Capitol, as there is overwhelming video evidence showing that it was supporters of President Trump who broke into the building.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on false information and baseless claims made by California Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove and other pro-Trump media sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Antifa is responsible for the storming of the U.S. Capitol without sufficient evidence or factual basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as video and photographs from the scene show people wearing and waving Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags, and reporters present described the crowd as Trump supporters."}
