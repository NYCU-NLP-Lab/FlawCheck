{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"crime is up\" in New York City under Mayor Bill de Blasio's leadership is contradicted by crime data kept by the New York Police Department, which shows that major felony offenses, other felonies, misdemeanors, and arrests have all decreased during de Blasio's tenure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is contradicted by crime data from the New York Police Department and FBI crime data, both of which indicate a decrease in crime rates in New York City.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that crime rates in New York City have increased solely due to Mayor Bill de Blasio's leadership, without considering other factors that may influence crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for any perceived increase in crime rates, such as changes in reporting methods or other external factors not directly related to de Blasio's leadership."}
