{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Nihang Sikhs marching to Delhi by stating that there are 20,000 of them, while the video evidence suggests otherwise.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 20,000 Nihang Sikhs are marching to Delhi on 2,000 horses.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question is at least two years old and does not depict a recent event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is recent and represents the current situation of Nihang Sikhs marching to Delhi in support of protesting farmers, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it has been identified as footage from a previous event called 'Delhi Fateh Divas 2018 Budha Dal Nihang Singh' celebrating the capture of Red Fort in 1783 by Sikh military general Sardar Baghel Singh."}
