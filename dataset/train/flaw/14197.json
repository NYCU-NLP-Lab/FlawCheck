{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the Indonesian police and military chiefs declaring support for President Joko Widodo in the 2019 election by using phrases like \"VIRAL!\" and \"IT HAS BEEN PROVED.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to substantiate the assertion that the police and military chiefs declared support for President Joko Widodo. The evidence provided is a video with a screenshot of high-ranking officials making a thumbs-up gesture, but it does not explicitly show them declaring support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the thumbs-up gesture made by the officials indicates support for President Joko Widodo's re-election bid. However, this may be a problematic assumption as the gesture could have other interpretations or meanings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the thumbs-up gesture made by the officials. It is possible that the gesture was unrelated to expressing support for a particular candidate and was instead a general gesture of approval or agreement.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the opposing candidate's (Prabowo Subianto) chances in the 2019 election by focusing solely on the support declared for President Joko Widodo."}
