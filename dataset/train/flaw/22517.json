The use of graphic images may be intended to exaggerate the severity of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove the occurrence of the alleged attack by Nigerian herdsmen.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pictures depict real-life violence caused by herdsmen, when in fact they are movie stills created by a makeup artist for special effects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the pictures are from movies and were created by a makeup artist for special effects, rather than depicting real-life violence caused by herdsmen."}
