{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the images show Myanmar soldiers excavating the grave of Kyal Sin. The expert's verdict mentions that the photos have been taken out of context and were posted online before Kyal Sin's death. Additionally, the claim does not provide any direct evidence or sources to verify the authenticity of the images.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images depict Myanmar soldiers excavating the grave of Kyal Sin without providing concrete evidence or verification. It relies on the assumption that the images are genuine and related to the specific incident mentioned.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that the body was exhumed with the permission of the family and a subsequent investigation found that Kyal Sin was not killed by the police. The claim implies that the images show soldiers excavating the grave, which contradicts the official investigation's findings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the images by mentioning a TikTok video showing soldiers digging up an old bomb in a different location. This suggests that the images may have been misattributed or misinterpreted, indicating the existence of an alternative explanation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the images by presenting them as evidence of soldiers excavating Kyal Sin's grave. Without proper verification or context, the claim amplifies the emotional impact and potential implications of the images.", "Understate": "No evidence of understatement bias is found in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "No evidence of faltering bias is found in the provided claim."}
