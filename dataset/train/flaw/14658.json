{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs created by infrastructure investment. The claim states that for each $1 billion in infrastructure investment, 42,000 jobs are created, while the updated federal study from 2007 shows that $1 billion in highway spending supports 27,800 jobs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on outdated data from 1996. The more recent data from 2007 shows a significant difference in the number of jobs created.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of jobs created by infrastructure investment remains constant over time, which is not supported by the updated data. The Department of Transportation explains that increases in construction materials prices and wages over time can reduce the number of jobs supported by each $1 billion invested.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the more recent data from 2007, which shows a lower number of jobs created per $1 billion in infrastructure investment compared to the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on outdated information from 1996 and not considering the changes in construction materials prices and wages over time.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of jobs created by infrastructure investment, as the updated data from 2007 shows a lower number compared to the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the Department of Transportation, which states that increases in construction materials prices and wages over time can reduce the number of jobs supported by each $1 billion invested. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assumption of a constant number of jobs created."}
