{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Denis Voronenkov was slated to testify against Paul Manafort in a treason trial in Ukraine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Voronenkov's murder was connected to his potential testimony against Manafort, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Voronenkov's own statement in February 2017 where he stated that he knew nothing about Manafort, suggesting that he had no intention of testifying against him.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Voronenkov's murder could have had alternative explanations unrelated to Manafort or the alleged treason trial.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Voronenkov's murder that are not explored in the claim, such as personal or political motivations unrelated to Manafort."}
