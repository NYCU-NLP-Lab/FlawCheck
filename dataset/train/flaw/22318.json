{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of Pakistani flags at Congress rallies by using strong language like \"does your blood not boil\" and questioning whether people will still vote for Congress.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Pakistani flags are waved at Congress rallies. The only evidence provided is an image of a green flag being waved at a political rally, but it is later clarified that the flag is not the flag of Pakistan but of the Indian Union Muslim League.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a green flag at a Congress rally automatically implies support for Pakistan or raises questions about loyalty to India. However, it is important to consider alternative explanations and not jump to conclusions based on appearances alone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of the green flag, such as the political affiliation of the Indian Union Muslim League, which is recognized by the Election Commission as a state party.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the green flag seen in the image is not the flag of Pakistan, but of the Indian Union Muslim League. The claim falsely implies that Pakistani flags are being waved at Congress rallies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information and fails to verify the true identity of the flag being waved at the Congress rally. It also falters in its attempt to link the presence of the flag to the Congress party's credibility or worthiness of votes.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
