{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of domestic surveillance by stating that \"the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.\" This may be an overstatement of the actual scope of surveillance activities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that law-abiding Americans with no connection to terrorism are targeted for surveillance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the intelligence community is collecting business records on law-abiding Americans without any connection to terrorism, which may be a problematic assumption without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the surveillance activities mentioned, such as the need for national security or the interpretation of relevant laws like Section 215 of the Patriot Act."}
