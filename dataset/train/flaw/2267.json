{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Broward Republican Executive Committee in having the League of Women Voters guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the League of Women Voters is \"liberal\" without providing evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or information to support the statement that the Broward GOP had the guide removed from the website."}
