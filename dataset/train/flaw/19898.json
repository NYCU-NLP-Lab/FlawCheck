{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the negative feelings expressed by the daughter in the obituary. The expert's verdict describes it as \"scathing and caustic,\" which implies a high level of negativity.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the daughter's feelings by simply stating that she expressed \"not-so-warm feelings.\" The expert's verdict describes the obituary as deviating from the expected loving expression and mentions that there will be no closure for the family.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times since it only provides a brief description of the daughter's expression without delving into the details or context of the obituary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples from the obituary to support the assertion that the daughter expressed negative feelings about her deceased mother.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that expressing negative feelings about a deceased loved one in an obituary is unusual or unexpected.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for why the daughter expressed negative feelings about her deceased mother."}
