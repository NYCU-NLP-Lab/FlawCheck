{"Lack enough support": "The claim that American polling shows Putin has an 80 percent approval rating is supported by a study conducted by American researchers. However, it is unclear if this study is the only source of support for the claim or if there are other polls that also show similar results.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the American polling mentioned by Trump is reliable and accurate. However, it does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The study mentioned in the expert's verdict raises the possibility of \"social desirability bias\" where respondents may lie to pollsters out of fear or social norms. This alternative explanation suggests that the high approval rating may not accurately reflect the true sentiment of the Russian people.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama's job approval rating is currently around 46 percent, which is significantly lower than the claimed 80 percent approval rating for Putin. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or evidence."}
