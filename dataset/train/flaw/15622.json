{"Lack enough support": "The claim made by Walker lacks enough support as the article mentions that the expert asked for evidence to back up Walker's statement, and the evidence provided only includes a few instances from the 2008 election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that early polling results are not indicative of who will become the nominees in presidential elections, which may be a problematic assumption as it overlooks the influence of campaigns and the potential for shifts in public opinion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why early frontrunners may not become the nominees, such as changes in candidate performance, campaign strategies, or shifts in public sentiment over time."}
