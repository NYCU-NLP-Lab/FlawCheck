{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of states that have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state. It is stated that 13 states have experienced this, but the expert's analysis shows that Missouri is not included in that list.", "Lack enough support": "The White House did not provide any evidence to support their claim, and the expert's analysis shows that the Bureau of Labor Statistics data does not include Missouri in the list of states with historic lows in unemployment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Missouri does not have the lowest unemployment rate in its history. The expert's analysis shows that Missouri's lowest unemployment rate on record occurred in 1999 and 2000.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in unemployment rates in the states mentioned. It simply attributes it to the policies promoted by President Trump, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decrease.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information about Missouri's unemployment rate. It presents a misleading statement that Missouri is one of the states with the lowest levels of unemployment in its history, which is contradicted by the expert's analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in unemployment rates in the states mentioned is solely due to the policies promoted by President Trump. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence and overlooks other factors that may have influenced the decrease in unemployment."}
