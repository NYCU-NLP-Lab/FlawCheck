{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Pete Gallego's lobbying activities after leaving Congress, as there is evidence to suggest that he worked in government relations for the City of Austin rather than engaging in traditional lobbying.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Pete Gallego \"went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress.\" The evidence provided only shows his employment in government relations for the City of Austin, which is not necessarily the same as lobbying.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that working in government relations for the City of Austin equates to lobbying, without providing clear evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Pete Gallego's post-Congress employment, as he worked in government relations for the City of Austin rather than engaging in traditional lobbying."}
