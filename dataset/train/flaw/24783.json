{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Mike Pence's views on condoms by stating that he called them \"too modern\" and \"too liberal.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Pence's comments were made in the context of a discussion about abstinence education and did not directly criticize condoms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mike Pence's comments on condoms reflect his overall stance on sexual health and disease prevention. The expert's verdict provides additional context about Pence's views on other topics such as creationism and gay conversion therapy, suggesting a connection between these issues and his stance on condoms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or direct quotes to support the assertion that Mike Pence called condoms a \"poor defense against sexually transmitted diseases.\" The expert's verdict does not provide any specific statements from Pence supporting this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mike Pence's comments on condoms, such as his religious beliefs or his stance on abstinence education. The expert's verdict provides the context of a panel discussion and different positions on science-based sex education, suggesting that the comments were made in that context rather than as a general dismissal of condoms."}
