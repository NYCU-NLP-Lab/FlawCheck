{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that voting in North Dakota may result in the loss of hunting licenses issued by other states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting in North Dakota automatically leads to the forfeiture of hunting licenses from other states without providing clear evidence or a logical explanation for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The North Dakota Secretary of State and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department have both stated that they do not know what the claim is referring to, indicating a contradiction to the claim's assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim's argument falters by not providing additional information, citations, or exposition to support its assertion, making it appear weak and unsubstantiated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be seen as an attempt to suppress conservative votes in North Dakota, as it targets a demographic (hunters) that traditionally leans conservative. This alternative explanation suggests a potential bias in the claim's motive.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it presents a potential consequence (losing hunting licenses from other states) without providing sufficient evidence or a clear explanation of how this would occur.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
