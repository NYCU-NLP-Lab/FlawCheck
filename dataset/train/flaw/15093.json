{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Arvind Kejriwal on providing free services, as it fails to mention that these services were provided by the Delhi government and not solely by Kejriwal himself.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of taxpayers in providing free services, as it implies that Kejriwal should not be thanked for them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Kejriwal is not responsible for the free services mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that everything provided for free is solely due to taxpayers and not due to government policies or other sources of funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the billboard was not specifically targeting Kejriwal but was a generic message about the role of taxpayers in providing public services."}
