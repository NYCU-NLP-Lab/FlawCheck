{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that \"chunks of frozen human waste\" fell on the cruise ship, when in reality, intentional mid-flight dumping of an airliner's sewage tank is not possible.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the incident described in the article did not actually happen. The expert's verdict explains that intentional mid-flight dumping of human waste is not possible and provides information on how airplane toilets work.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a Taiwanese airliner dumped human waste onto the cruise ship, without providing any evidence or proof to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that intentional mid-flight dumping of an airliner's sewage tank is not possible, as explained by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the incident, stating that leaks in airliner sewage tanks or drain tubes can result in accidental falls of \"blue ice\" (frozen mixtures of waste treatment liquid, water, and human waste) from planes passing overhead."}
