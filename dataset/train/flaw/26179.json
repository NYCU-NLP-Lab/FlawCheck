{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the comparison between the treatment of foreign children by Germany in 1944 and the U.S. in 2018, as the expert's verdict states that it is a false equivalency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the images used in the meme are not accurate or relevant to the comparison being made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that the treatment of foreign children in the U.S. in 2018 is comparable to the treatment of children by Nazi Germany in 1944.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images used in the meme are not from 2018 and do not depict migrant children being held in detention in the U.S.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the images used in the meme, which are actually of Palestinian children waiting to receive food at a soup kitchen in the West Bank.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a false equivalency and missing the mark in accurately comparing the treatment of foreign children in Germany and the U.S.", "Understate": "There does not seem to be any evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
