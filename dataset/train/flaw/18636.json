{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the cost of Medicaid expansion by stating that it will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million through 2022. The actual estimate from the Kaiser study suggests that the gross cost of expansion would be slightly higher than $1.3 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the $902 million cost estimate. It only cites a year-old graph by the Heritage Foundation without providing any additional sources or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the federal government cannot be trusted to pay its promised share of Medicaid expansion costs. This assumption is based on the Republican-controlled House of Delegates' refusal to expand the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives on the cost of Medicaid expansion, such as potential savings or benefits that could offset the costs.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the potential costs of Medicaid expansion by not considering all factors and relying on a single source for estimates.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual cost of Medicaid expansion by only focusing on the $902 million figure, which is lower than the estimated gross cost of over $1.3 billion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the federal government will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the first two years and pay 90 percent of the cost in the future. The claim implies that Virginia taxpayers will bear the full burden of the cost."}
