{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"We're broke. We don't have any more money\" can be seen as an exaggeration because it presents a dire financial situation without providing sufficient evidence or context to support the statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any data, statistics, or specific evidence to back up the assertion that there is no money left.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state's financial situation is solely responsible for the lack of money, without considering other factors such as mismanagement, allocation of funds, or potential revenue sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the financial situation, such as potential sources of revenue or alternative solutions to address the budget deficit.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies heavily on the repeated use of the phrase \"we're broke\" without providing a comprehensive analysis of the state's financial situation.", "Understate": "None of the biases listed appear to understate the claim."}
