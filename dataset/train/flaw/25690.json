{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of Gerald Daugherty's advocacy for lowering the penalty for strangulation in domestic violence cases. The evidence provided suggests that Daugherty made a statement about the possibility of re-classifying strangulation as a misdemeanor, but there is no indication of him actively pushing for this change or exploring it further.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Daugherty advocated for lowering the penalty for crimes like strangulation solely because it would \"throw more people into the jail system.\" While Daugherty's statement does mention that strangulation as a felony raises the numbers, it does not necessarily mean that his primary motivation was to increase the jail population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Daugherty advocated for lowering the penalty for crimes like strangulation. The evidence provided only shows a statement made by Daugherty during a work session, but there is no further indication of his active advocacy for this change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Daugherty's statement about strangulation, such as concerns about the classification of certain offenses or the potential impact on the criminal justice system. Without further information or clarification from Daugherty, it is difficult to determine the exact motivation behind his statement."}
