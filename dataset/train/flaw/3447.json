{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the penalty imposed by the UP government on the Muslim protester. The expert's verdict states that the claim falsely suggests that the protester was heavily penalized, which contradicts the actual fine amount mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove the authenticity of the image and the accuracy of the claim made. The expert's verdict mentions that the image is almost three years old and its connection to the Malda riots is uncertain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image represents a Muslim protester pelting stones for money during the recent anti-CAA protests. However, there is no concrete evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the image could not be conclusively linked to the Malda riots, and it is possible that the image may not represent the claimed scenario accurately. This suggests the existence of alternative explanations for the image.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image is old and not related to the recent anti-CAA protests. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the image being posted in 2016, which contradicts the claim's implication that it is a recent photograph.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the provided claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
