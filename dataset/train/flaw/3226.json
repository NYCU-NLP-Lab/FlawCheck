{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of new permanent residents who obtained that status by virtue of their family status. The expert's verdict confirms that nearly two-thirds of new legal permanent residents in 2011 entered based on family ties, which is higher than what the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that nearly two-thirds of new permanent residents obtained their status through family ties. The expert's verdict provides data from the federal government's yearbook of immigration statistics to validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that prioritizing family reunification in immigration policy is not aligned with the needs of employers. However, this assumption is not directly addressed or supported in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of new permanent residents based on family status. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either, but it does mention that the U.S. government grants a limited number of family-sponsored visas per year, indicating that there are other factors at play."}
