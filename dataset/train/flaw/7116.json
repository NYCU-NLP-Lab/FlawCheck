{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Pravin Gordhan does not have a degree is exaggerated, as there is evidence from the University of KwaZulu-Natal confirming that he graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree in 1973.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on social media posts raising doubts about Gordhan's qualifications, which are not reliable sources of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of Gordhan's name in a search on the South African Pharmacy Council website means he does not have a degree. However, the website also includes learners and students who may not be listed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the fact that Gordhan was registered with the South African Pharmacy Council from 1975 to 1997, indicating that he was a qualified pharmacist during that period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the University of KwaZulu-Natal confirmed Gordhan's graduation and completion of the requirements for a pharmacy degree.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and speculation, rather than concrete evidence or official statements from relevant authorities.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim."}
