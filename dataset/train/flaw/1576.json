{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of participants who fell ill during the trials, stating that \"volunteers\" got sick, when in fact only one participant fell ill.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actions taken by Johnson & Johnson to update the public. The company released a statement in October 2020 explaining the findings and ruling out the vaccine as the cause of the illness.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Johnson & Johnson never provided updates on the illness.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Johnson & Johnson never shared information about the illness, when in fact the company released statements and updates regarding the trial and the illness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the illness experienced by the trial participant was unrelated to the vaccine, as determined by independent investigators."}
