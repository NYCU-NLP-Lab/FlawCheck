{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of new jobs created by stating \"over 500,000 new jobs\" when the actual number is 533,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully credit President Trump for all 533,000 jobs, as the January report is not based on job gains that occurred during his presidency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 533,000 jobs can be attributed to President Trump's policies, without considering other factors such as technological advances or developments overseas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for job growth, such as the continuation of trends from the previous administration, as the average monthly gain for Obama's final full year was higher than the average monthly gain under Trump.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the actual job growth on Trump's watch, as the U.S. economy created 317,000 jobs in the two months for which data is available, not 500,000.", "Understate": "The claim understates the job growth by not including the April jobs report, which hasn't been released yet, and could potentially increase the total number of new jobs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the January report is not based on job gains that occurred during Trump's presidency, therefore it is not accurate to include it in the total number of new jobs created."}
