{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough scientific evidence or research to support the effectiveness of swallowing active dry yeast to prevent getting drunk.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the active yeast in the stomach will somehow prevent the alcohol from being metabolized into acetaldehyde and then into acetate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of swallowing active dry yeast by presenting a personal anecdote of Jim Koch, the co-founder of Boston Beer Company, who claims to never get drunk by following this practice.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that the science behind the claim is confusing and acknowledges that the process of alcohol metabolism is more complex than simply adding yeast to the stomach.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the enzyme ADH is naturally produced in the human body and can be found in high concentrations in the stomach and liver, suggesting that the presence of yeast may not be the sole factor in alcohol metabolism."}
