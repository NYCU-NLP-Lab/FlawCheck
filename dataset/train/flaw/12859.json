{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of knife attacks committed by Muslim immigrants in London by stating that 11,000 out of 13,000 attacks were done by them. The actual number of knife crimes in London during the specified time period is lower than claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Muslim immigrants were responsible for the majority of knife attacks in London. It is not backed up by any reliable data or official reports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the religion and immigration status of offenders are relevant factors in determining responsibility for knife attacks. However, there is no available information or evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data provided by the Metropolitan Police Service, which states that there were 14,700 recorded knife crimes in London during the specified time period, not 13,000 as claimed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider other possible factors or explanations for the surge in knife crime in London, such as socio-economic factors, gang violence, or drug-related issues. It solely focuses on Muslim immigrants as the supposed cause, without considering other potential factors."}
