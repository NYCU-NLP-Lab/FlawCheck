{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the student protester was strangled to death, while the evidence provided suggests that the video shows a policeman pinning the young man on the ground.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the student protester was strangled to death. The video and information provided do not confirm the student's death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows an Indonesian policeman strangling a student protester to death, without considering alternative explanations or further investigation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it is about a man who pretended to be possessed after allegedly attacking a traffic police officer. This suggests that the claim's interpretation of the video may not be accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not about a student protester being strangled to death but rather a different incident involving a man pretending to be possessed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by simplifying it to a single act of police brutality, without considering the broader context of protests and clashes between protesters and police in Indonesia.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the content of the video and the events it depicts, leading to a misleading interpretation of the situation."}
