{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a report from The Telegraph without any direct confirmation or statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being single is considered a disability under the WHO's definition of infertility, which is not clearly stated or confirmed by the WHO.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or interpretations of the WHO's revised definition of infertility, as it is not directly quoted or confirmed by the organization itself.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the potential impact or implications of the WHO's revised definition of infertility, as it states that it \"dramatically changes the definition\" but does not provide further details or analysis.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the WHO denied the reporting from The Telegraph and that their official website does not reflect any changes to their terminology concerning infertility.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the impact or significance of the WHO's revised definition of infertility, as it states that it sets an international legal standard and countries are bound by it, without providing concrete evidence or sources to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on quotes and statements from a reproductive health practitioner rather than directly from the WHO, which may introduce potential biases or misinterpretations."}
