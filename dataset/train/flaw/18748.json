{"Contradict fact": "The claim that President Obama snubbed the funeral of Justice Scalia is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that Obama attended a visitation for Scalia but did not attend the funeral.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Presidents do not historically attend all funerals of Supreme Court justices, which is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Obama chose to play golf instead of attending the funeral.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's decision not to attend the funeral was a snub, but the expert's verdict suggests that it was a reasonable decision and endorsed by people close to Scalia's family.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for Obama's decision, such as potential competing demands on his time and the potential distraction his presence would cause during the funeral."}
