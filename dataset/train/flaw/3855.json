{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the amount of money held in frozen Iranian assets by stating that the U.S. held $150 billion, when in fact, the assets were held mostly by banks and financial institutions outside the U.S.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that the U.S. held $150 billion in frozen Iranian assets.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. had direct control over the frozen Iranian assets, which is incorrect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the unfrozen Iranian assets, such as the role of banks and financial institutions in holding the assets."}
