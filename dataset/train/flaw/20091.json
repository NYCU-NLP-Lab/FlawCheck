{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of texts between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, stating that there were \"19,000 texts\" when the actual number is around 20,000.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the text messages were not \"wiped clean and gone.\" The inspector general's report clearly states that the text messages were recovered using forensic tools.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the missing text messages were purposely and illegally deleted, which is not supported by the inspector general's report.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation provided by the inspector general's report, which states that the missing text messages were due to a compatibility issue between the FBI-issued phones and the text message collection tool."}
