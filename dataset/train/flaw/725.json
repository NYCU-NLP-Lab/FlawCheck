The evidence provided consists of a video and tweets with captions, but there is no direct confirmation or reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident portrayed in the video represents a lack of respect towards Manmohan Singh. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the intent or significance of the chair swapping.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the chair swapping incident, such as a simple rearrangement of seating arrangements or a misunderstanding. Without more information, it is not possible to conclude that it was a deliberate act to disrespect Manmohan Singh."}
