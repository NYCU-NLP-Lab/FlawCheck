{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that there is a 2.5 million-vote lead, which is not entirely accurate when considering the caucuses with full vote counts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because the data provided is incomplete, particularly in caucus states where the raw vote tallies are not available.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of delegates awarded to each candidate is directly proportional to the number of votes they received, which may not always be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in vote counts, such as variations in voter turnout or demographics in different states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bernie Sanders has won five out of the past six contests, suggesting that Clinton has a significant lead overall.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the actual lead Clinton has, as it only accounts for a 2.5 million-vote lead when considering the caucuses with full vote counts."}
