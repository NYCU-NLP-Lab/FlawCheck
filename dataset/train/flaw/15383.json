{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that child care costs \"in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition.\" This implies that child care costs are higher than college tuition in multiple states, which may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the statement that child care costs exceed college tuition in some states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that child care costs and college tuition costs can be directly compared, without considering other factors such as quality of care or the duration of expenses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high costs of child care, such as differences in regulations, staffing, or facilities between states.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the extent to which child care costs exceed college tuition, as it only mentions \"some states\" without providing specific numbers or percentages."}
