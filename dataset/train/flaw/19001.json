{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the presence of ISIS in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if unaccompanied minors can cross the border, trained terrorists can as well, without providing evidence for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The federal government asserts that there is currently no credible threat of ISIS planning an attack on US soil, contradicting the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Law enforcement officials suggest that it is much more likely for ISIS and other extremists to enter the US by commercial plane rather than crossing the southern border."}
