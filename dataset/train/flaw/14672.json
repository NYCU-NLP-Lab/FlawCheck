{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the probability of Biden winning in the mentioned states is less than one in a quadrillion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that votes in the November election were uniformly distributed across every county, which may not be an accurate assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the late swings to Biden in the four key states were statistically possible and expected based on the uncounted votes.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and variability of voter demographics and voting methods within different counties and states, which can significantly impact election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the observed swings in the four key states, such as demographic differences between counties and variations in voting methods."}
