{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict highlights that Mayor Rahm Emanuel has a history of making exaggerated claims, such as about the city's economic growth and school system. Therefore, it is likely that the claim of Chicago having the \"largest drop in the United States of America\" in teen smoking is also an exaggeration.", "Understate": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claim understates any information or data.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is not supported by enough evidence. It states that there were bigger drops in teen smoking rates in at least nine other large urban school districts or counties, suggesting that the claim lacks sufficient support.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any problematic assumptions in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations for the claim."}
