{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the pay rise given to the Australian prime minister by stating that he gave himself a \"big\" pay rise.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Australian prime minister gave himself a pay rise, as it only provides a photo and text without any further evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pay rise given to the Australian prime minister is detrimental to the working class, without providing any evidence or explanation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the pay rise, such as the decision being made by an independent statutory authority based on economic conditions and reviews of public offices."}
