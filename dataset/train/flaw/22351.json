{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the rarity of the phenomenon, stating that it is visible \"once in 100-250 years\" without providing enough evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the phenomenon is as rare as claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows a full rainbow, when in fact it is a 22 degree Halo caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the phenomenon shown in the video, which is a sun halo caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere, rather than a full rainbow.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the phenomenon shown in the video is not as rare as claimed, as it has been seen at various places around the world.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the video as a full rainbow when it is actually a sun halo, and by not providing enough evidence to support the rarity of the phenomenon.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
