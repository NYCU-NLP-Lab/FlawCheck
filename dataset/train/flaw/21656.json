It jumps to the conclusion that the man's nationality was the motive behind the attack.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that the incident captured in the videos was not part of the recent deadly unrest in Johannesburg and was not linked to immigration.

The expert's investigation highlights the need for more information and the lack of evidence supporting the initial claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media videos and a poem as the main sources of information. These sources may not always provide accurate or reliable information, leading to potential inaccuracies in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
