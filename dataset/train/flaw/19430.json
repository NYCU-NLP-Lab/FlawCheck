{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of new auto plants announced by Japanese car companies in Michigan. The expert's verdict states that Japanese car companies didn't announce five new plants in Michigan.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs in Michigan has gone down under Trump, not up.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to prove that the conversation between President Trump and Prime Minister Abe directly led to the announcement of five plants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the conversation between President Trump and Prime Minister Abe was the sole reason for the announcement of five plants, without considering other factors or negotiations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the announcement of new auto plants in Michigan, such as previous plant constructions and industry trends."}
