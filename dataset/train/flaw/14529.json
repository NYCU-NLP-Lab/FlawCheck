{"Exaggerate": "The claim may contain an exaggeration by stating that the federal system that verifies employees' work authorization is inaccurate \"anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80\" percent of the time. This range of inaccuracy seems to be a significant overstatement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the federal system is inaccurate to such a high degree. It is unclear what data or research the claim is based on.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the federal system that verifies employees' work authorization is inherently inaccurate, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. It is possible that there are other factors or issues contributing to any inaccuracies, but the claim does not acknowledge this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any inaccuracies in the federal system. It assumes that the system itself is flawed, without exploring other potential factors that could contribute to inaccuracies, such as human error or fraudulent documentation.", "Falters at times": "The claim suggests that the federal system consistently falters in verifying employees' work authorization, without acknowledging any instances where the system may actually be accurate. This one-sided perspective indicates a bias towards portraying the system as consistently inaccurate.", "Contradict fact": "Without any supporting evidence, the claim contradicts the fact that the federal system for verifying employees' work authorization is designed to be accurate and reliable. The claim's assertion that the system is inaccurate to such a high degree goes against the intended purpose and design of the system.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement in the claim."}
