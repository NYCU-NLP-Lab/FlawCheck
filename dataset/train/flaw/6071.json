{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Maxine Waters told CNN that the SCOTUS pick should be an illegal immigrant. This is confirmed by the expert's verdict, which states that the image is fake and no credible reports indicate its authenticity.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Maxine Waters' stance by falsely attributing the statement about an illegal immigrant as a potential Supreme Court justice nominee to her.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no credible reports or evidence to back up the statement made in the image.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Maxine Waters would advocate for an illegal immigrant to be nominated as a Supreme Court justice, without any basis or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the doctored image, suggesting that it was likely lifted from a previous interview where Waters made no mention of an immigrant nominee for the Supreme Court."}
