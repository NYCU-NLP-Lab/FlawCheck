{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that people as young as 12 are getting marriage licenses in Virginia, while the evidence provided only shows the youngest bride being 12 in certain years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided only shows data for a limited period of time (2004-2014) and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the current situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of underage marriages in Virginia is a prevalent issue, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the data provided, such as cultural or religious practices, which are not explored in the claim or evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes an \"underage\" marriage in Virginia, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the issue of underage marriages in Virginia, as the evidence provided only focuses on a specific age range (12-15) and does not provide information on marriages involving older minors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any known facts, but it does present a perspective that may be challenged or questioned based on the limited evidence provided."}
