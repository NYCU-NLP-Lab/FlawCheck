{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of solar panel plants that have opened since the imposition of tariffs. The expert's verdict states that only one new announced facility is known to have been opened.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for the statement that \"seven or eight\" solar panel plants are opening. The expert's verdict mentions that the White House press office was asked for a list of the plants, but no response was received.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tariffs on solar panels are directly responsible for the opening of new plants. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the connection between the tariffs and the opening of new plants is not clear.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some U.S. manufacturers had announced or discussed plans to expand capacity, but none of those plans were definitive at the time. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim of new solar panel plants opening."}
