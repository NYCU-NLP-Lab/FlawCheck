{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that Shivraj Singh Chouhan promotes drinking of alcohol.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Chouhan's statement about supplying alcohol in the state means that he promotes drinking of alcohol, which may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Chouhan's statement, such as criticizing the previous government's decision to open liquor stores while neglecting other pressing issues.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the context and intentions behind Chouhan's statement, as it only focuses on one aspect without considering the broader context of his remarks.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing Chouhan's stance on alcohol, as he has previously debunked similar viral videos and expressed his commitment to taking legal action against those sharing fake videos.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Chouhan has denied promoting drinking of alcohol and has accused the opposition of spreading fake videos for political gain.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Chouhan's stance on alcohol by attributing the promotion of drinking to him based on a single statement without considering the larger context of his remarks."}
