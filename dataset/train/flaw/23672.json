{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential job loss by stating that Illinois will lose 90,000 jobs without providing sufficient evidence or support for this prediction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or research to back up the assertion that raising the minimum wage will result in job loss.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in unemployment in 2007 was directly caused by the minimum wage increase in 2006, without considering other factors such as the Great Recession.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the job loss and unemployment increase, such as the overall economic conditions during that time period, as pointed out by experts."}
