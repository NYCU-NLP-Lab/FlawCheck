{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of bills sponsored by Rep. David Cicilline, as the expert's verdict mentions that he has actually sponsored 21 pieces of legislation, not 20.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the statement that none of Rep. Cicilline's bills have advanced past the embryonic committee stage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that a lack of bills advancing past the embryonic committee stage is solely due to the lack of effectiveness of a backbencher in the minority party, without considering other factors that may contribute to this outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for bills not advancing, such as the influence of the minority party or the control of the House and Senate by different parties.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that one of Rep. Cicilline's bills, H.R. 2027, was reported out of the House Committee on Natural Resources, indicating that at least one bill did advance beyond the committee stage.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the number of bills sponsored by Rep. Cicilline and not considering the status of bills that have advanced beyond the committee stage."}
