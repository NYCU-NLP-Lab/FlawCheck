{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Trump's statement by implying that he said \"wages in America are too high\" without providing the context that he was specifically referring to the minimum wage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's statement about the minimum wage translates to a belief that overall wages in America are too high, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists in which Trump's statement about the minimum wage is not indicative of his belief that overall wages in America are too high."}
