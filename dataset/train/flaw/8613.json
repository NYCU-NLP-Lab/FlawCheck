{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the nutritional standards are not being reduced whatsoever. The expert's analysis suggests that while the standards may not be changed directly, schools are being allowed to not follow them, which could effectively result in a reduction in nutritional standards.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving schools more time to comply with the standards will help children get more of the nutrition they need. However, this assumption may be problematic as it disregards the potential negative impact of not adhering to the standards.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that easing school lunch regulations does not reduce nutritional standards whatsoever. The expert's analysis highlights the discrepancy between the claim and the reality of schools being allowed to not follow the standards.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the expert compares the situation to posted speed limits on roads. While the speed limits may remain the same, allowing individuals to go as fast as they want effectively reduces the impact of the limits. Similarly, allowing schools to not follow the nutritional standards could reduce their effectiveness."}
