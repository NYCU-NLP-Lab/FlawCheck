{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the food stamp call center program is administered from foreign shores. The expert's verdict provides evidence that only a small percentage (1.3 percent in February) of calls are handled overseas.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of calls that are actually handled overseas. The expert's verdict provides evidence that 3 percent of calls were handled overseas, which is higher than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the entire state program is administered from foreign shores. The expert's verdict provides evidence that only a small percentage of calls are handled overseas, but does not provide information about the administration of the entire program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of foreign call centers is a negative aspect of the food stamp program. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which does not provide any evaluation of the effectiveness or efficiency of the call center program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the use of foreign call centers, such as cost savings or language proficiency of call center employees. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either."}
