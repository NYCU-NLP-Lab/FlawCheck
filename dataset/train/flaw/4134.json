{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Hobby Lobby CEO David Green is refusing to close stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is misleading to suggest that all stores are remaining open, as some have been closed in locations where \"non-essential businesses\" have been required to do so.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the measures taken by Hobby Lobby to address the pandemic, such as increasing the frequency of store cleanings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to confirm whether or not CEO David Green sent a letter to employees mentioning that his wife had received a message from God. The total number of Hobby Lobby stores that have closed is also unclear.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to keep stores open is solely based on Barbara Green's message from God, without considering other factors or reasons behind the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Hobby Lobby's decision to keep some stores open, such as following local guidelines or considering the economic impact of closures."}
