{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks credible direct or anecdotal evidence to support the quote attributed to Neil DeGrasse Tyson.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Neil DeGrasse Tyson's interest in \"astrological physics\" stemmed from his experience stealing and consuming LSD as a young teen, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The existence of a notorious 1960s-era urban legend that the quote references suggests that it is likely a fake.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of credibility and verifiability of the quote, as it only mentions the absence of links to credible evidence without emphasizing the complete absence of news coverage or direct confirmation from Tyson himself.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the established biographical information about Tyson's early life, which states that his interest in science and space began at the age of nine, not as a result of his alleged LSD consumption."}
