{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ronald Reagan would have been kicked out of the GOP if the proposed litmus test had been in place during his political career.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the proposed litmus test by stating that it would have resulted in the GOP kicking out Ronald Reagan.", "Understate": "The claim understates the support for the proposed litmus test within the Republican Party by not mentioning any arguments in favor of it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Ronald Reagan would have failed the litmus test, as the expert's verdict only mentions one issue where Reagan deviated from today's Republican orthodoxy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed litmus test is solely based on today's political environment and does not take into account the historical context in which Ronald Reagan operated."}
