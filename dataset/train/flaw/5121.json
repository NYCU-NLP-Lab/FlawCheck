{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in stating that Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade. This is because there were instances where Howell voiced opposition to tax increase plans and did not vote on them.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as there were instances where Howell opposed tax increase plans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide comprehensive evidence or data to prove that Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Howell is solely responsible for every major tax increase, without considering other factors or individuals involved in the decision-making process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the tax increases in Virginia, such as the involvement of other politicians, external economic factors, or changing public opinion."}
