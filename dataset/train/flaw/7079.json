While it acknowledges that video conferencing technology has been used in some cases, it does not provide any information about the frequency or scale of such practices.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a comprehensive and balanced perspective on the use of iPads for virtual visits with COVID-19 patients. It focuses primarily on emotional impact and anecdotal evidence, without discussing potential limitations, challenges, or alternative approaches to virtual visits.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and logistical challenges associated with implementing virtual visits using iPads for COVID-19 patients. It does not address potential technical issues, connectivity problems, or the need for training and support for both patients and healthcare providers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or discuss alternative explanations or approaches to facilitating communication between COVID-19 patients and their loved ones, such as phone calls, written messages, or other forms of remote communication."}
