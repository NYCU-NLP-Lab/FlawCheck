{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Sanders performs better than Clinton against Trump in polls. The expert's verdict mentions that Sanders ran stronger against Trump in six out of seven polls, but it does not provide specific data on the margin of difference between their performances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of providing specific data or evidence from multiple polls to back up the statement that \"almost every poll\" shows Sanders doing better than Clinton against Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that head-to-head polls at this stage of the campaign are reliable indicators of general election performance. The expert's verdict mentions that they decided to check with polling experts to determine the reliability of these polls.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Sanders may be performing better than Clinton against Trump in polls. The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked for a long time, while Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters, which could potentially influence their perceptions.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or examples of when the claim may not hold true.", "Understate": "The claim does not seem to understate any information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts."}
