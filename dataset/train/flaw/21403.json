{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that county governments have received a cumulative of KSh1.25 trillion shillings as equitable share.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount mentioned (KSh1.25 trillion) is accurate and reliable without providing further context or explanation.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may understate the actual amount received by county governments, as it only mentions the cumulative amount up to the 2017/18 financial year, without providing information on subsequent years.", "Contradict fact": "Without additional information or evidence, it is not possible to determine if the claim contradicts any specific facts or data."}
