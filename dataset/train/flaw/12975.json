{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of a mask mandate in May in Wisconsin resulted in no significant difference in COVID-19 cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there was no significant difference in cases when masks were not mandated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lack of significant difference in cases, such as other preventive measures or factors influencing the spread of the virus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no mask mandate in place during the stay-at-home order in May, which undermines the argument that the absence of a mandate led to no significant difference in cases.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of mask-wearing on reducing COVID-19 transmission by suggesting that there was no significant difference in cases when masks were not mandated.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the observed data by implying that it definitively proves the ineffectiveness of masks, when other factors could have influenced the case numbers."}
