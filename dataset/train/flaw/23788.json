{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo shows the Italian president crying over COVID-19 when it actually shows Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro shedding tears during a Thanksgiving speech in December 2019.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading photo and does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Italian president's tears are a result of a shortage of burial space for COVID-19 victims, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo shows Brazil's president getting emotional while recalling being stabbed during the 2018 election campaign, which is a completely different context from the claim made in the post."}
