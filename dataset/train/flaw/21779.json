{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the flu shot by stating that a 9-year-old girl was paralyzed as a result of receiving it. The expert's verdict clarifies that while the girl did develop a rare neurological condition, most cases of ADEM resolve completely or carry only minor long-term consequences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct causal relationship between the flu shot and the girl's paralysis. The expert's verdict mentions that the event's causal relationship to the flu shot is a much more complicated area of science and that it has been misrepresented in anti-vaccine posts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flu shot directly caused the girl's paralysis without considering other potential factors. The expert's verdict mentions that ADEM can be triggered by a flu shot but does not necessarily establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the girl's paralysis, such as other potential infections or factors that could have contributed to her condition. The expert's verdict mentions that ADEM can also be triggered by infections, not just vaccinations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that most cases of ADEM resolve completely or carry only minor long-term consequences. The expert's verdict provides this information to counter the claim's exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times based solely on the provided information.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information."}
