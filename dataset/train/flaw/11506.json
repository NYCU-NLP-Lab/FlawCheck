{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Hillary Clinton's tax plan by stating that it will \"even double your taxes.\" Independent experts have found that this would be the exception rather than the rule.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Clinton's tax plan on the richest Americans. Independent analyses have shown that taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution would see their tax burdens increase by more than $78,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Clinton's plan will raise taxes and double them. Independent analyses have shown that the impact of her tax plan would vary depending on income levels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's tax plan will uniformly raise taxes for all Americans, which is not supported by the independent analyses mentioned. The impact of her plan varies depending on income levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the impact of Clinton's tax plan. It only presents Trump's statement without considering other factors or perspectives."}
