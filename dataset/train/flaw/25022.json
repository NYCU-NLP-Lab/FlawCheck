{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Sen. Elizabeth Warren that her children \"went to public schools\" is misleading, as her campaign later clarified that one of her children attended both public and private schools.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the information provided by Warren's campaign, which clarified the schooling situation of her children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that both of Warren's children attended public schools, which is proven to be false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Warren's statement was a result of a misunderstanding or miscommunication, rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive."}
