{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the use of the word \"all\" in the claim may signify an exaggeration. However, the expert also states that the claim is not far off, indicating that there may be some truth to it.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides evidence to support the claim, stating that Russia is violating many important security agreements. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of these violations, which can be seen as a lack of enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rules, treaties, and understandings kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years. While the expert's verdict supports the claim that Russia is violating these agreements, it does not explicitly address the assumption that these agreements were the sole reason for peace in Europe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not mention any alternative explanations for Russia's violations of the rules, treaties, and understandings. It focuses on confirming the claim rather than exploring other possible reasons for Russia's actions."}
