However, there is no credible evidence to support these assumptions, and it has been widely debunked.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Obama's birth certificate, suggesting that if he claims Kenyan citizenship, his entire presidency would be null and void, including Supreme Court decisions.
