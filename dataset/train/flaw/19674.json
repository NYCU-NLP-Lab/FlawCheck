{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the song \"867-5309/Jenny\" by stating that it prompted a flood of calls to that phone number. The expert's verdict mentions that the song did cause grief and resulted in waves of kids dialing the number, but it doesn't provide specific evidence or data to support the claim of a \"flood\" of calls.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the song by not fully acknowledging the ongoing issue of crank calls received by people with the phone number \"867-5309.\" The expert's verdict mentions that even years after the song dropped off the charts, phone customers with that number were still getting plenty of crank calls, indicating a more significant impact than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it doesn't provide any specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the song prompted a flood of calls to the phone number. The expert's verdict mentions the annoyance experienced by individuals with the number, but it doesn't provide any quantitative or qualitative data to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim doesn't consider alternative explanations for the flood of calls, such as the possibility that the song may have inspired curiosity or prank calls rather than genuine interest in talking to \"Jenny.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the joke quickly became old for those who had the number and weren't interested in talking to horny teens, implying that the calls may not have been sincere attempts to reach \"Jenny.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flood of calls was solely prompted by the song \"867-5309/Jenny\" without considering other factors that may have contributed to the phenomenon. The expert's verdict mentions that the phone number was assigned to individuals even years after the song's popularity declined, suggesting that the number itself may have played a role in attracting calls beyond the song's influence."}
