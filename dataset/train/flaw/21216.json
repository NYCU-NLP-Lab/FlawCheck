{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo, suggesting that it shows \"pro-Trump votes found buried\" when in fact the ballots were unopened and had not been filled out in favor of any candidate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photo shows \"pro-Trump votes found buried.\" The photo itself does not provide any information about the political affiliation of the ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the discovery of unopened ballots is evidence of voter fraud or manipulation, which is a problematic assumption without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the unopened ballots were stolen from mailboxes and discarded, rather than being intentionally buried as a form of voter fraud."}
