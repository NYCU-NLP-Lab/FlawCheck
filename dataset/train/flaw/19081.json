{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the issue by stating that \"38 percent of firearms dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law.\" The actual figure is closer to 31 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of licenses revoked by stating that \"only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked.\" The actual figure is 0.68 percent of inspected dealers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove the connection between noncompliance and license revocation. The expert's verdict mentions that only 71 out of the noncompliant dealers had their licenses revoked, which is a small number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low percentage of license revocations is due to \"bad actors\" being granted unique protections in laws and barriers faced by law enforcement agencies. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low percentage of license revocations, such as dealers making changes to become compliant after receiving warnings or the rarity of willful noncompliance."}
