{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of J.B. Pritzker's tax plan by stating that it includes a \"new tax per mile you drive with government tracking device.\" The expert's verdict suggests that Pritzker has only expressed support for testing the idea of a vehicle mileage tax, but has not committed to implementing it on a wide scale.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that J.B. Pritzker's tax plan includes a specific tax per mile driven with a government tracking device, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that J.B. Pritzker's tax plan includes a new tax per mile driven with a government tracking device. The expert's verdict suggests that Pritzker has only expressed openness to testing the idea of a vehicle mileage tax.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that some states have experimented with recording and taxing miles traveled instead of gallons purchased, primarily to address the issue of electric and hybrid vehicles not contributing enough towards road repairs. This alternative explanation suggests that the proposed tax may not be solely aimed at regular vehicles but could be part of a larger effort to find fair ways to fund road repairs."}
