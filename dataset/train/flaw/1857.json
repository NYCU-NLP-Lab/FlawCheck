{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the reason why Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields by stating that it is solely due to concerns about global warming. The expert's verdict suggests that there are other reasons for not bombing the oil fields, such as ongoing military efforts to target and destroy ISIS' oil infrastructure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the statement that Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is due to concerns about global warming. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence of Morell giving congressional testimony on this specific point.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for not bombing ISIS' oil fields is solely due to concerns about global warming. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there are other factors and strategies involved in targeting and destroying ISIS' oil infrastructure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for why Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields, such as ongoing military efforts and the need to target specific infrastructure. This suggests that the claim may not consider these alternative explanations and presents a biased viewpoint."}
