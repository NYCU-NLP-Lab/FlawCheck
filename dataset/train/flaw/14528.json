{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the protest by stating that the Sikh farmers were \"defacing traffic signboards,\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the Sikh farmers were indeed involved in defacing traffic signboards.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Sikh farmers' protest is linked to the Khalistani agenda without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photos, as they were previously published in 2017 and may not be directly related to the recent farmers' protest."}
