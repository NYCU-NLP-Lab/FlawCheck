{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Hillary Clinton's plan by stating that it would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent. The actual proposed surcharge applies only to high earners with an adjusted gross income of over $5 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that many small businesses would be taxed at nearly 50 percent. It does not provide specific examples or statistics to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed 4 percent surcharge on high earners would apply to virtually any small business with substantial income, regardless of industry. However, this assumption may not be accurate as the surcharge only applies to individuals or small business owners who report their business income on their individual tax returns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the impact of Hillary Clinton's plan on small businesses. It presents only one viewpoint, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue."}
