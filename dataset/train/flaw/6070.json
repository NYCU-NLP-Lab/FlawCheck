{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Trump's effort to nullify the Affordable Care Act by stating that it would \"take 100 million people with preexisting conditions and move them in a direction where they can't get coverage.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that not all individuals with preexisting conditions would lose coverage, as the claim suggests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's effort to nullify the Affordable Care Act would automatically result in the inability of 100 million people with preexisting conditions to obtain coverage. The expert's verdict highlights that this assumption is misleading, as it would only apply to individuals seeking coverage on the individual market without employer or public insurance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the statement that 100 million people with preexisting conditions would be unable to get coverage. The expert's verdict provides additional context and clarifies that the figure represents an estimate for the number of Americans with preexisting conditions outside of Medicare and Medicaid.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all individuals with preexisting conditions would lose coverage if the Affordable Care Act is nullified. The expert's verdict explains that while the preexisting condition protections in the ACA would be lost, individuals with employer-based plans or public insurance would still have coverage.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the figure of 100 million people with preexisting conditions in different ways, which may lead to confusion or misinterpretation. The expert's verdict mentions that Joe Biden presented the figure differently in an interview and a speech.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations or acknowledge that individuals with employer-based plans or public insurance would still have coverage even if the ACA is nullified. The expert's verdict offers this alternative explanation to counter the claim's suggestion that all 100 million people with preexisting conditions would be unable to get coverage."}
