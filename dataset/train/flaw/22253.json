{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Israeli drones being supplied to India by stating that it is the same drone that India is purchasing from Israel. This may not be entirely accurate as the claim lacks sufficient evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the drone mentioned in the CGI video is the same drone that India is purchasing from Israel. The video is a concept design uploaded by a Russian inventor and does not represent the India-Israel defense deal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Israel denied selling the drone to China solely because it opposes India. However, this assumption may not be the only reason behind Israel's decision and lacks enough evidence to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Israel's denial of selling the drone to China, other than just opposing India. The claim fails to consider these alternative explanations and jumps to a conclusion without sufficient evidence."}
