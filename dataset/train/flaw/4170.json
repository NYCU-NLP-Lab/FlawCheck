{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kanhaiya Kumar was campaigning behind Afzal Guru's poster, when in reality, he was standing behind the symbol of the Communist Party of India.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a description of a photograph and does not provide any additional evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kanhaiya Kumar was intentionally campaigning behind Afzal Guru's poster, without considering the possibility that the image was photoshopped or manipulated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the image was photoshopped, as it is mentioned that the image in circulation was manipulated to show Afzal Guru's portrait on the CPI's poster."}
