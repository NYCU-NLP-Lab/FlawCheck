{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Tommy Thompson's support for \"massive\" tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs. The evidence provided does not explicitly state that Thompson supports such tax cuts on a massive scale.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided, such as Thompson's endorsement of Paul Ryan's budget plan, does not directly support the claim that Thompson supports massive tax cuts for outsourcing corporations. More evidence or clarification is needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Thompson's support for tax cuts automatically translates to support for corporations that outsource jobs. This assumption may not be accurate, as the evidence provided does not explicitly link Thompson's tax cut support to outsourcing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Thompson's support for tax cuts, such as a belief in stimulating economic growth or attracting businesses to Wisconsin. The claim does not consider or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
