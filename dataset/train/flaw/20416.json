{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the stance of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on shutting down shale and natural gas. While Clinton has expressed concerns and conditions regarding fracking, the claim presents it as a definitive desire to shut it down completely.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Clinton and Kaine's statements on regulating fracking and setting conditions for its continuation mean they want to shut it down completely. This assumption overlooks their stated intentions of regulating and ensuring safety.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific quotes from Clinton and Kaine to support the assertion that they want to shut down shale and natural gas. It relies on general statements made by Trump without providing direct evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton and Kaine's stance on fracking, such as concerns about environmental impact, public health, or the need for proper regulation. It presents their position as solely aimed at shutting down the industry without exploring other potential motivations."}
