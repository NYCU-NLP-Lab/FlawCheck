However, the provided information indicates that the referendum only addresses supervisors' pay, and there is no clear mention of the board budget being cut by two-thirds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no direct evidence or specific information provided that confirms the claim's accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the referendum gives the people the ultimate decision-making power on the budget cut, but the information provided does not explicitly state this. It is possible that other factors or entities may have influence or control over the final decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that influence the decision-making process regarding the Milwaukee County Board budget cut, but the claim does not consider or address these alternative explanations."}
