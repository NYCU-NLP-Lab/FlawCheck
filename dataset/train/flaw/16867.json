{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the violence in Milwaukee since 2010 by stating that it has seen an \"uptick\" in violence. The available data suggests that there have been fluctuations in the number of homicides, but it is unclear if there has been a consistent increase in overall violence.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of violence during the winter months by suggesting that it is the \"only period of calm.\" While it is mentioned that there was a surge of homicides in August and September of 2013, it is not clear if there were similar surges during other winter months.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to substantiate the assertion that violence has increased since 2010 and that the only period of calm is during winter. The available information includes some statistics on homicides and violent crime, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall trends.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in violence during the summer months is not due to hot weather and short tempers, but rather due to increased human interaction. This assumption is not supported by any specific evidence or research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fluctuations in violence in Milwaukee since 2010. It does not explore other potential factors such as changes in policing strategies, socioeconomic conditions, or community dynamics that could contribute to the observed patterns."}
