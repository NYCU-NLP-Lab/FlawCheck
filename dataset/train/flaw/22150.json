{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of illegal immigrants who come on legal visas and overstay, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that the percentage could be as high as 58%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on outdated studies and estimates, and there is no recent data available on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstay their visas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that building a border wall with Mexico will significantly reduce the flow of unauthorized immigrants, which may be a problematic assumption as there are alternative explanations and factors that contribute to illegal immigration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for illegal immigration, such as people crossing the border illegally or entering through other means besides legal visas."}
