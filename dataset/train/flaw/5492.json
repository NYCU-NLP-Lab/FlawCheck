{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the U.S. government is the largest low-wage employer by not considering the distinction between federal contractors and direct government employees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide comprehensive data on low-wage workers employed directly by the U.S. government.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the largest low-wage employer is inherently unjust, without considering other factors such as job availability or economic context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher number of low-wage workers in federal contracts, such as the size and scope of government operations compared to private companies like McDonald's and Walmart."}
