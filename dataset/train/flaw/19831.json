{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that for the first time in history, the North Atlantic is completely empty of cargo ships in transit. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is based solely on a map from MarineTraffic.com, which does not provide evidence that all cargo ships have stopped sailing in the North Atlantic Ocean.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is solely based on a map from MarineTraffic.com, which does not provide comprehensive coverage of all cargo ships in the North Atlantic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of cargo ships in-transit in the North Atlantic is solely due to people not buying things, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the absence of cargo ships in-transit, such as limitations of the AIS system and the coverage area of MarineTraffic.com."}
