{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a report from McKinsey and Company that does not specifically break down the results for people who purchased insurance through Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that most people who signed up through the Obamacare exchanges already had insurance, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim leaves open the possibility that there may be alternative explanations for why people signed up through the Obamacare exchanges, such as changing plans or being uninsured for a significant portion of the previous year.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Obamacare in getting more people insured, as the law aimed to cover 32 million people out of the 48 million who were uninsured.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obamacare was designed to increase the number of insured individuals, not eliminate the uninsured altogether."}
