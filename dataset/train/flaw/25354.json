{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no published research specifically addressing the question of whether there was job growth every year that Congress increased the federal minimum wage. This lack of specific research support suggests a bias of lacking enough support for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict states that Cardin's claim is not literally true, as there were instances where increasing the federal minimum wage was not followed by national job growth. This suggests a bias of the claim faltering at times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that there isn't an expert consensus among leading economists regarding the effect of minimum wage increases on job growth. This suggests the presence of alternative explanations and differing opinions on the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data is inconclusive and there isn't enough evidence to support Cardin's claim. This suggests a bias of contradicting the factuality of the claim.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly understate the claim, as it presents evidence both supporting and contradicting the claim. However, it does highlight that the data is inconclusive, which could be interpreted as an understatement of the claim's certainty.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not exaggerate the claim, as it presents conflicting evidence and states that the claim is not literally true.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict does not mention any problematic assumptions made in the claim."}
