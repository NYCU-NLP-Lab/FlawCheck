{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the turnout in November 2012 by stating that it was a \"record year\" and that more people voted before Election Day than ever before in history.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual turnout in November 2012 by not considering the percentage of voters who participated, which was lower compared to previous elections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that November 2012 was indeed a record year of turnout. The expert's analysis shows that there were multiple previous elections with higher turnout percentages.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher overall turnout and increased pre-election day voting automatically indicate a record year, without considering other factors such as population growth and changes in voting patterns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides alternative explanations for the long lines and other problems on Election Day, such as the long ballot and insufficient equipment, which may have influenced the high number of early and absentee voting."}
