{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decrease in murders in America and America's major cities, stating a decrease of \"more than 10%\" when the actual decrease reported by federal data is 6.9%.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Chicago has seen a significant decrease in murders in recent years, with a 27% decrease compared to two years ago.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement about the decrease in murders in America and major cities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that excluding Chicago from the total numbers would result in \"incredible\" numbers, without providing any evidence or reasoning for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the decrease in murders in America and major cities, focusing solely on Chicago as a contrasting example."}
