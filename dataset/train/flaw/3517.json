{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the incident by stating that a baby girl died as a result of the ambulance being blocked. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Delhi police blocked the ambulance for Rahul Gandhi's motorcade. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the video actually shows an incident from April 2017, where an ambulance was blocked by police in central Delhi.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ambulance was blocked specifically for Rahul Gandhi's motorcade, without providing any evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict does not mention any connection between Rahul Gandhi and the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for why the ambulance was blocked. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that the ambulance was blocked due to the convoy of Malaysia's visiting Prime Minister.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident shown in the video is from April 2017, not a recent event as implied by the claim. The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this contradiction.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or errors in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information as it makes a strong assertion about the incident. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to suggest that the claim is understating the situation.", "Biases not present": "The biases of \"Falser at times\" and \"Understate\" are not applicable in this case as there is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters or understates the situation."}
