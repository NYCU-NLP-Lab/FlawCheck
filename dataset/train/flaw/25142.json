The expert's verdict provides additional context and information about Gingrich's position, indicating that the claim may be oversimplifying the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting taxpayer funding of some abortions is a negative aspect of Gingrich's record. This assumption may be subjective and could be seen as biased against Gingrich.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gingrich's position on taxpayer funding of abortions. The expert's verdict highlights that Gingrich's stance was in line with many moderates and provides additional context to understand his position."}
