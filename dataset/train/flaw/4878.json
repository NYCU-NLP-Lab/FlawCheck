{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which sanctuary jurisdictions violate the laws of the nation, as no courts have yet determined a local jurisdiction to have actually violated the specific section of U.S. code mentioned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because no list of jurisdictions decidedly in violation of federal law has been provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sanctuary jurisdictions encourage illegal immigration and compromise the security of law-abiding citizens without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the term \"sanctuary\" is broadly applied and there is no single understanding of what constitutes a sanctuary jurisdiction.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue, as a law professor mentioned that no state or local jurisdiction has actually violated federal laws.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough evidence or clear definitions to support its statements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no state or local jurisdiction has instituted policies that violate the specific federal laws mentioned."}
