{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the file folders presented as evidence were completely empty or contained only blank sheets of paper. This may be an exaggeration as there is no concrete evidence provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the file folders were indeed empty or contained blank sheets of paper. It relies on social media posts and personal experiences, which may not be reliable sources of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the empty or blank file folders presented as evidence indicate that President-elect Donald Trump was not actually turning his business holdings over to his children. This assumption is problematic as it does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the appearance of empty or blank file folders. It is possible that the contents of the folders were confidential or sensitive, and therefore not displayed to the press."}
