{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the federal government borrows \"almost $60 billion per week\" may be an exaggeration as the expert's verdict states that the public debt had risen by an average of slightly more than $4 billion a day between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, and by about $2.6 billion a day in the current year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides data on the average daily increase in public debt but does not specifically address the weekly borrowing amount.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the borrowing amount is consistent and occurs every week, without providing evidence or context for this assumption.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative data on the average daily increase in public debt, suggesting that the claim of borrowing \"almost $60 billion per week\" may not be accurate."}
