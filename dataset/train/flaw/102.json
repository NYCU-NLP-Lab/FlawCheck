{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of pupils who both attend grammar schools and are entitled to free school meals. The expert's verdict explains that for every pupil who meets both criteria, there are 999 who do not. This suggests that the actual number of such pupils may be higher than what is implied by the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to verify the accuracy of the statement. The expert's verdict mentions that the government states 2.5% of grammar school pupils are entitled to free school meals, but it does not provide further evidence or sources to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the representation of pupils who attend grammar schools and are entitled to free school meals is one out of every thousand pupils in general. This assumption may not be accurate or applicable to all contexts or regions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the government is interested in studying the wider impact of selective education on low-income students, not just those entitled to free school meals. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors to consider when examining the representation of pupils in grammar schools who receive free school meals."}
