{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific details or evidence to support the assertion that John Kasich has spent 177 days out of state and used $350,000 in taxpayer money on his campaign. The article mentions that the Ohio Democratic Party posted a graphic on Facebook to support their complaint, but it does not provide any additional information or sources to verify these numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of Kasich's out-of-state travel and campaign expenses are being funded by taxpayer money. While it is mentioned that the governor's security detail is likely paid for by state funds, there is no clear evidence or breakdown of all the expenses associated with Kasich's campaign.", "Falters at times": "The article mentions that state agencies are being secretive and not providing specific information about the expenses related to Kasich's campaign. This lack of transparency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Kasich's out-of-state travel and campaign expenses. The article mentions that Kasich was exploring his presidential bid before his official announcement, which could account for some of the days spent out of state. Additionally, the claim does not consider other potential sources of funding for Kasich's campaign, such as private donations or campaign funds.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual number of days Kasich has spent out of state and the amount of taxpayer money used for his campaign. Without more specific information and evidence, it is difficult to determine the full extent of Kasich's travel and expenses."}
