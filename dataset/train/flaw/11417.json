{"Understate": "The claim may understate Brett Kavanaugh's legal experience prior to his nomination as a federal judge in 2003. The expert's verdict mentions that Kavanaugh had accumulated legal experience, including working in the White House and on high-profile cases, which suggests that his experience was more extensive than implied in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Kavanaugh was promoted directly from a law clerk to a judgeship. The expert's verdict provides information about Kavanaugh's career path and legal experience, indicating that he did not go directly from being a law clerk to a federal judge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kavanaugh's lack of trial experience is a significant issue or disqualifying factor for his nomination. However, the expert's verdict suggests that while Kavanaugh may not have personally tried cases from start to finish, he had contributed legal analysis and argument as part of a team or in relation to specific components of larger cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents Kavanaugh's lack of trial experience as a negative aspect, implying that it may impact his qualifications as a judge. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Kavanaugh had argued cases before the Supreme Court, appellate courts, and trial courts, suggesting that he had experience in other legal settings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kavanaugh was not promoted directly from a law clerk to a federal judge. The expert's verdict clarifies that Kavanaugh had a significant legal career, including various experiences, before his nomination to the D.C. Circuit.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Kavanaugh's lack of trial experience, as the expert's verdict indicates that he had participated in legal proceedings and argued cases before different courts.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information. The provided expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any instances of the claim faltering."}
