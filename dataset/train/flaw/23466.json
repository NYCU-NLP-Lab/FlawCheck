The expert's verdict provides historical examples and data to counter the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee by a Senate of a different party than the president is a significant issue. However, the expert's verdict suggests that it is not uncommon and has occurred multiple times throughout history.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or circumstances that may have influenced the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees in the past. The expert's verdict provides examples of instances where a Senate of a different party confirmed a nominee, suggesting that there are alternative explanations for the claim."}
