{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Democrats in just 2 months by stating that they have destroyed 1 million energy jobs.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the issue by failing to mention that the job losses in the energy sector occurred before Biden took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that 1 million energy jobs have been destroyed. No study backs up this figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Biden policy affects all new oil and gas development on federal property, leading to job losses, when in reality it only affects new leasing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for higher gas prices and the border crisis, such as the improving economy and global oil markets."}
