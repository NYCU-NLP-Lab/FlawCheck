{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the attitudes of two different sets of immigrants by presenting an image that is out of context and digitally manipulated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used in the meme does not actually depict immigrants flipping off America but rather individuals of Mexican descent flipping off demonstrators.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that immigrants entering the United States receive a wide range of government benefits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that immigrants who entered the United States through Ellis Island in the early 20th century did not receive any financial assistance from the federal government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the attitudes and actions depicted in the image, such as the context of a demonstration held by an anti-immigration group."}
