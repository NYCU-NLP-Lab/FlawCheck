{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the raid by stating that FBI agents raided Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz's home and seized smashed computer hard drives. The expert's verdict clarifies that it was actually the home of her former aide, Imran Awan, that was raided, and the equipment was reported by new tenants who took over the premises after Awan moved out.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it was Awan's home, not Wasserman-Schultz's home, that was raided and where the smashed computer hard drives were seized. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Daily Caller story that supports this contradiction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any credible sources or evidence to back up the assertion that FBI agents raided Wasserman-Schultz's home and seized smashed computer hard drives. The expert's verdict points out the lack of direct confirmation from the FBI, Capitol Police, and the U.S. Attorney's office regarding the seizure of hard drives from Awan's former home.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the raided home belonged to Wasserman-Schultz, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that it was Awan's home and provides evidence from the Daily Caller story to support this clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of smashed computer hard drives in Awan's former home. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the equipment was reported by new tenants who found it in the garage and believed it to be government-issued equipment.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as there is no specific evidence or information provided to support this bias.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or facts."}
