{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that every student paying out-of-state tuition covers more than the cost of instruction, which may not be entirely accurate or applicable to all cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that every out-of-state tuition covers more than the cost of instruction. The article mentions that the subject is more complicated than expected and that it is not clear what the actual cost of education is.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of instruction is the sole factor in determining out-of-state tuition fees, which may not be the case as there are other factors involved such as research, expertise, and other responsibilities of professors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions that college tuition is not strictly based on the cost of education, as professors also conduct research and provide expertise to the public. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the determination of out-of-state tuition fees."}
