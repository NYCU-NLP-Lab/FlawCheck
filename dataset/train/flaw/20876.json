{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Joe Kyrillos' vote on raiding the state's pension funds, stating that it is costing New Jersey taxpayers nearly $15 billion to repay the money, which is an exaggeration of the actual cost.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that Joe Kyrillos' vote is costing New Jersey taxpayers nearly $15 billion to repay the money. It does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Kyrillos' vote to sell bonds for the pension system constitutes a raid on the funds, which is a problematic assumption. The expert explains that the bond legislation authorized the sale of bonds and deposited the proceeds into the state retirement funds, which does not fit the definition of a raid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that the bond legislation allowed the state to reduce their normal contributions to the pension system by using surplus funds, which helped balance the budget. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Joe Kyrillos' vote was a raid on the pension funds."}
