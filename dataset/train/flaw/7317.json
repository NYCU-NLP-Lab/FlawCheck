Dan Patrick of Houston, who was a statewide elected official, has publicly expressed opposition to a guest-worker program.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the uniqueness or significance of the speaker's support for the guest worker plan by stating that he was \"somewhat uniquely\" in favor of it without providing evidence or comparison to other officials."}
