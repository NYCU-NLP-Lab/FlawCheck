{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that George Bush's statement about not investigating the government's response to Hurricane Katrina was incompetent, without providing evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that John McCain stood with George Bush on this issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that McCain's opposition to creating an independent commission was based on procedural or legislative concerns, rather than a lack of interest in investigating the government's response to Hurricane Katrina."}
