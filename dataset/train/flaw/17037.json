{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Schumer helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall in 2014. There was no such deal in that year.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Schumer's support for a border wall, as the 2013 legislation he sponsored and voted for included funding for border security measures, including fencing, but not a full \"impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall\" as described by Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Schumer opposes Trump's $5 billion request solely because he is a Republican. This is presented as a mock confession without sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Schumer's support for border security measures in 2013 is directly comparable to Trump's proposed wall, which Schumer's office argues is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as Schumer's office points to a tweet from Trump where he differentiates between a \"fence\" and a \"wall,\" suggesting that the 2013 legislation Schumer supported was not the same as Trump's promised wall."}
