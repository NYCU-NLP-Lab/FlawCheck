{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"Obamacare premiums have doubled\" in Wisconsin may be an exaggeration. The expert's analysis suggests that the average premium increase in Wisconsin was not as high as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's analysis points out that the claim is based on a report that may have skewed the data, leading to an inflated average premium for 2017. This lack of sufficient support undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in premiums is solely due to Obamacare, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the rise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis mentions that before Obamacare, millions of people had no coverage at all. This alternative explanation suggests that the premium increases may be partly due to the expansion of coverage under Obamacare rather than solely its implementation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's analysis, which suggests that the average premium increase in Wisconsin was not as high as claimed."}
