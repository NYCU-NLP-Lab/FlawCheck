{"Contradict fact": "The claim falsely attributes a Facebook post expressing frustration with COVID-19 and racial divisions to tennis star Serena Williams. The expert's verdict contradicts this and states that the post was actually written by another Facebook user with the same name.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or proof to support the attribution of the Facebook post to Serena Williams.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Facebook post was written by Serena Williams without verifying the information. This assumption is proven false by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict is that the Facebook post was written by another Facebook user with the same name as Serena Williams, not the tennis star herself."}
