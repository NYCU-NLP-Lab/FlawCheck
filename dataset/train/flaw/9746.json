{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of bad policy put in place by environmentalists as the major cause of forest fires.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that bad policy (not clearing out the forests) is the main reason for forest fires, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that environmentalists' policies are responsible for the majority of forest fires.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are multiple factors contributing to forest fires, including extensive drought and combustible material, as well as limited budgets and fire policies dating back to the early 1900s. This indicates that there are alternative explanations for the occurrence of forest fires."}
