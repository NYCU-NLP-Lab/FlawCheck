{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of coronavirus patients killed in China by stating that there are 25,000 killed, without providing any evidence or reliable sources to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video clip and a tweet from a Bollywood actor's sister as evidence, without any additional credible sources or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows people being shot down due to having the virus in China, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is a combination of at least four different sequences, which have been merged into one. This contradicts the claim that the video shows a single incident of people being killed due to the virus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the video, such as it being a staged or manipulated video, or it showing a different situation unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak in China. However, without further investigation or evidence, it is difficult to determine the exact alternative explanation."}
