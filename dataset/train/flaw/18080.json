The expert's verdict provides more context and analysis to better understand Biden's position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Biden's opposition to the child care tax credit. The expert's verdict highlights Biden's concern about the government subsidizing the deterioration of the family through the tax codes as the main reason for his opposition.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting Biden's views on working mothers and not providing sufficient evidence.
