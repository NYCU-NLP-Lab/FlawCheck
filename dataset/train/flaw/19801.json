{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Justice David Prosser has prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court. This assumption may be problematic as it implies that Prosser is not impartial, which is a subjective judgment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Prosser has actually prejudged cases. It is based on statements made by Kloppenburg without providing concrete examples or specific instances where Prosser has demonstrated bias.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Kloppenburg's claim, such as political motivations or campaign rhetoric. The claim does not consider other possible reasons for making such an accusation against Prosser.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Prosser's alleged prejudgment on the court's decisions. It mentions the court challenge to Gov. Scott Walker's collective bargaining law as an example, but does not explore the potential consequences of biased decision-making.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judicial candidates from making statements that commit them regarding \"cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court.\" If Prosser has indeed prejudged cases, it would be a violation of this code.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Prosser's alleged prejudgment by suggesting that it would be a serious matter. While prejudgment can be problematic, the claim does not provide enough evidence to determine the extent of its impact on Prosser's role as a justice."}
