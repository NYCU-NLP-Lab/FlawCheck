{"Understate": "The claim may understate the Libertarian Party's stance on the public school system by not directly stating that they want to get rid of it, but instead emphasizing their belief in the free market and parental control over education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reader believes that getting rid of the public school system is a negative thing, without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be interpreted as an alternative explanation for why young voters might be moving from Bernie Sanders to Gary Johnson, suggesting that Johnson's stance on the public school system may be a factor. However, this is not explicitly stated in the claim."}
