{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photograph shows Barack Obama bowing to Ayatollah Khamenei is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the image was edited using separate photos of Khamenei and Obama.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of the photo by implying that Obama bowed deeply to Ayatollah Khamenei, when in reality, the image was taken during a different context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Obama bowed to Ayatollah Khamenei, as the expert's verdict clearly states that the image was manipulated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph depicts Obama bowing to Ayatollah Khamenei without providing any substantial evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that it was edited using separate images of Khamenei and Obama, which suggests that the claim's interpretation of the photo is not accurate."}
