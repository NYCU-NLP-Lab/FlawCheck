{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of mass shootings that have occurred in the United States in the last year. The expert's verdict states that there have been far fewer mass shootings where four or more people are killed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the claim of more than 270 mass shootings in the last year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the definition of a mass shooting is universally agreed upon, when in fact there is wide disagreement on how mass shootings are defined. Different sources and organizations have different criteria for what constitutes a mass shooting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been fewer mass shootings where four or more people are killed, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations and criteria for defining mass shootings, highlighting the differences in counting and categorizing such incidents."}
