{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it suggests that all those who do not answer directly to the president have said that repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell is a terrible idea, without providing specific evidence or quotes to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that all those who do not answer directly to the president oppose the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the opinions of all those who do not answer directly to the president can be generalized and that they all hold the same view on repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations for the opposition to repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, such as concerns about military readiness during a time of war, as mentioned in the statement from U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert. However, the claim does not acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
