{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Ossoff \"facing federal investigation\" is an exaggeration as there is no indication of such an investigation.", "Lack enough support": "The only support for the claim is a letter from the Georgia Republican Party requesting an investigation, but there is no indication that the committee has responded or that an investigation is likely.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Georgia GOP's request for an investigation automatically means that Ossoff could face one, which is a problematic assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing concrete evidence or facts to support the assertion of a potential federal investigation.", "Alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the claim is a political tactic used by Perdue's campaign to create doubt or suspicion about Ossoff's candidacy."}
