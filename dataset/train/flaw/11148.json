{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the reliance of Social Security beneficiaries on the post office to get their checks. While some beneficiaries still receive paper checks, the majority receive their benefits electronically.", "Understate": "The claim understates the shift towards electronic payments for Social Security benefits. It fails to acknowledge that the Treasury Department phased out paper checks for Social Security and other federal benefits by 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Social Security beneficiaries \"count on the post office\" for their checks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the post office is the primary or exclusive means for Social Security beneficiaries to receive their checks, which is not accurate given the availability of electronic payments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the post office plays a supporting role in delivering Social Security checks to a small percentage of beneficiaries who still receive paper checks, but it is not the primary method for the majority of recipients."}
