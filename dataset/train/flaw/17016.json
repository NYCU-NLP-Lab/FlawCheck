{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that the sanctions were lifted \"without any proof of change in conduct.\" This is because the nuclear agreement with Iran includes provisions for Iran to limit its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is no proof of change in conduct by Iran, which may be a problematic assumption. The nuclear agreement includes measures for monitoring and verification of Iran's compliance with its commitments.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that there was no proof of change in conduct before lifting the sanctions. It lacks enough support to substantiate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decision to lift the sanctions. The nuclear agreement was reached after negotiations between Iran and a group of six nations, and it was backed by 41 Senate Democrats. The decision may have been based on a range of factors and not solely on the absence of proof of change in conduct."}
