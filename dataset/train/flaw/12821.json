{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that shutting down the fracking wells at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport caused the earthquakes to stop. While there is a plausible linkage suggested by a seismologist, it does not provide conclusive proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the earthquakes at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport were directly caused by the fracking wells injecting fluid into the ground. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to seismic activity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cessation of earthquakes at the airport. It solely attributes it to the shutdown of the fracking wells, without exploring other factors that may have influenced the seismic activity.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of the information, as it does not provide a clear timeline or specific details about the relationship between the well shutdown and the subsequent cessation of earthquakes.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential environmental impacts of fracking, as it does not address the broader concerns and controversies associated with this practice."}
