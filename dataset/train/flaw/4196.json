{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the knowledge that the neighbors had about the shooters' intentions. The expert's verdict states that there were no reports of neighbors having any inkling of an attack being planned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or reports to support the assertion that the neighbors knew about the shooters' plans to attack the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the neighbors had knowledge of the shooters' intentions based on their conversations, but there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the neighbors' behavior, such as not wanting to be seen as using ethnic profiling or not having enough concrete evidence to report suspicious activity."}
