{"Contradict fact": "The claim that \"Costco closed stores across the U.S. in February 2021\" contradicts the fact that there is no indication of Costco closing stores in their fiscal year 2020 financial results.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or information provided to back up the statement that Costco closed stores in February 2021.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the online advertisement mentioning store closures in 2020 was referring to Costco, even though Costco was not mentioned in the article and the ad itself was outdated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim was based on a misleading clickbait ad that falsely led readers to believe that Costco would be closing its stores.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of e-commerce on brick and mortar stores by suggesting that only a few major stores have closed their physical doors, while in reality, the closing rate has been growing rapidly.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of store closures in 2020 by stating that it \"may get worst\" without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information from a poorly written and grammatically incorrect story, which may affect the credibility and reliability of the claim."}
