{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a doctored image that has been shared on social media.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protesters in Myanmar are referencing Thailand based on the language on the banner. However, the original image shows a Burmese-language banner opposing the military coup.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the doctored image was created to draw a connection between the protests in Myanmar and the pro-democracy movement in Thailand.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a doctored image as evidence, which undermines its credibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original image shows a Burmese-language banner, not a Thai-language banner as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the healthcare workers' protest in Myanmar against the military coup, as it focuses more on the doctored image and its connection to Thailand.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
