{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the people of Tiverton have historically supported gambling measures at a higher rate than the rest of the state lacks enough support. The expert's investigation into past gambling ballot questions shows mixed results and does not provide strong evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that past support for gambling measures in Tiverton indicates an openness to the issue and suggests that it may lead to local approval for a casino. However, this assumption may be problematic as the expert's investigation shows that past support for gambling measures in Tiverton has been inconsistent and does not necessarily guarantee future support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential higher support for gambling measures in Tiverton. The expert's investigation mentions factors such as the proximity of Tiverton to Southeastern Massachusetts and Aquidneck Island, which may contribute to the higher support due to the customer base of Newport Grand."}
