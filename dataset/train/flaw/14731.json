{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that there are no medical malpractice suits until 2024, even if they are not COVID-related. The bill does not explicitly ban the filing of lawsuits until 2024, but it does make cases more difficult to succeed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the contents of the bill, as it does not explicitly prohibit medical malpractice suits until 2024.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not accurately reflect the provisions of the bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bill completely prohibits medical malpractice suits until 2024, which is not entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the bill sets strict standards for medical malpractice cases, which could restrict the number of cases filed."}
