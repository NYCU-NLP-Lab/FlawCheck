{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they searched on Nexis and could not find any evidence to support the claim that President Trump approved scholarships for African students. This suggests that the claim lacks sufficient evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the article is rife with grammatical errors and points out that the headline references \"50,000 African Student\" instead of \"50,000 African students.\" This contradiction of facts undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump approved scholarships for 50,000 African students without providing any evidence or official sources to support this assumption. This lack of substantiation makes the assumption problematic.", "Exaggerate": "The claim uses the phrase \"US President D. Trump Approves Scholarship for 50,000 African Student to Study in USA 2018,\" which suggests a large number of scholarships (50,000) being approved. However, there is no evidence or support provided to justify such a high number, indicating a potential exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article is filled with grammatical errors and almost reaches the point of incomprehensibility. This indicates that the claim falters in terms of its presentation and clarity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that a similar hoax appeared before, where another website claimed that Trump had approved \"fully government-sponsored scholarships for international students... in USA universities.\" This alternative explanation suggests that the claim could be part of a recurring hoax or misinformation."}
