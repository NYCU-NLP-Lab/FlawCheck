{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Twitter thread and back-of-the-envelope calculations, which may not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the candidates endorsed by Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that the percentage of Trump-endorsed candidates who lost applies to all the candidates he endorsed, when in fact it only applies to the candidates mentioned in the Twitter thread.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual success rate of Trump's endorsements by suggesting that 71% of his endorsed candidates lost, while the expert's verdict indicates that the endorsements won at least 54% of their races.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only 70.9% of the candidates President Trump endorsed were defeated, not the claimed 71%.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Trump's endorsements by focusing solely on the candidates who lost, without considering the candidates who won or the races that were still undecided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the candidates' losses, such as their own campaign strategies, local factors, or the overall political climate during the 2018 midterms.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a single Twitter thread and back-of-the-envelope calculations, which may not provide a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the impact of Trump's endorsements."}
