{"Lack enough support": "The claim states that deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent since the \"stand your ground\" law was passed in Florida in 2005. Without further evidence or data to support this claim, it may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in deaths due to self-defense is directly caused by the \"stand your ground\" law. This assumption may not be valid without further analysis and evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in deaths due to self-defense. There could be other factors at play that contribute to this statistic, such as changes in crime rates or societal factors."}
