{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of disabled citizens stuck on waiting lists in Ohio. The expert's verdict states that there are about 60,000 people on county waiting lists across Ohio, but it does not specifically mention disabled citizens.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of Medicaid expansion on disabled citizens. The expert's verdict highlights that the expansion of Medicaid has not directly caused the waiting lists for disabled individuals and argues against creating a connection between the programs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Medicaid expansion is the cause of disabled citizens being stuck on waiting lists. The expert's verdict points out that the waiting lists mentioned are part of a separate program called home and community-based services (HCBS), which has been in place for 30 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to directly link Medicaid expansion to disabled citizens being stuck on waiting lists. The expert's verdict provides information about the HCBS program and the different funding mechanisms for Medicaid expansion and HCBS, but it does not provide direct evidence to support or refute the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the waiting lists, stating that the expansion adults (able-bodied adults added to Medicaid rolls) are generally healthier and use fewer services compared to individuals on HCBS waivers who have chronic and long-term disabilities. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Medicaid expansion is the cause of disabled citizens being stuck on waiting lists.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and accurate representation of the situation in Ohio regarding disabled citizens and waiting lists. The expert's verdict provides additional context and information that challenges the claim's narrative.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the waiting lists mentioned are not directly related to Medicaid expansion but rather part of the HCBS program. The expert's verdict clarifies this contradiction."}
