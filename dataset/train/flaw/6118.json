{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documentation to support the assertion that people have died specifically because they couldn't access a ventilator or ICU bed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the lack of access to ICU beds or ventilators and deaths, without providing clear evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported deaths, such as underlying health conditions or other factors that may have contributed to the fatalities.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of overwhelmed hospitals on patient outcomes, as studies have shown that mortality rates can increase when hospitals are overwhelmed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the American Hospital Association that they are not aware of any patient dying because they couldn't access a ventilator.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which deaths can be attributed solely to the lack of access to ICU beds or ventilators, as there is little documentation specifically linking these factors to COVID-19 deaths."}
