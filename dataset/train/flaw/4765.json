{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photographs show members of the migrant caravan burning the U.S. flag is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that none of the photographs were taken in 2018 and none of them actually depict the caravan members burning the flag.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerated the actions of the migrant caravan by stating that they were burning the American flag as they marched towards the USA, portraying them as invaders rather than asylum seekers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about the photographs or their origins.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals in the photographs are members of the migrant caravan without providing any evidence or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the photographs, stating that one of them shows a Trump banner being burned during an anti-Trump riot in 2016, and another one shows a flag burning protest outside the American Embassy in London in 2010."}
