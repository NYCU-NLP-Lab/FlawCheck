{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that the brother of the Dayton shooting victim posted a pro-Trump message on social media using the name \"Jerry Jerry.\" The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence of the existence of a brother or any family member by that name.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the social media post attributed to the brother of the victim is genuine and accurately represents their views. However, the expert's verdict points out that the Facebook page and GoFundMe campaign associated with \"Jerry Jerry\" are questionable and have been suspended or no longer in use.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the victim, Logan Turner, does not have a brother or any family member by the name of \"Jerry,\" as confirmed by the obituary published by the funeral home handling Turner's memorial services.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the social media post and the associated \"Jerry Jerry\" persona were created as part of an online hoax or misinformation campaign. The expert's verdict highlights the involvement of pro-Trump internet personality Jack Posobiec and the questionable actions of his social media moderator."}
