{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Peter Kilmartin's role in the 38 Studios loan guarantee, stating that his job was to \"twist [legislator\u2019s] arms to vote for deals like this.\" This may overstate his influence and involvement in the decision-making process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that Peter Kilmartin's State House job was specifically to \"twist [legislator\u2019s] arms to vote for deals like this.\" It is a general statement without concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Peter Kilmartin's vote for the loan program automatically makes him responsible for the failure of 38 Studios. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that led to the company's downfall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Peter Kilmartin's vote, such as the possibility that he may not have been fully aware of the potential consequences or that he believed in the potential benefits of the loan program.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Peter Kilmartin was not Fox's second in command and was not assigned to the role of twisting arms to force support for the deal. This statement in the claim is false and contradicts the actual facts of the situation."}
