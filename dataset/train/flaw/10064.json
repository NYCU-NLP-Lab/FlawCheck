{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the creation of a hybrid marijuana-strawberry plant by a student at the University of Miami. The expert's verdict states that the image showing the hybrid plant is obviously fake and the original image only shows a marijuana plant without strawberries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a satirical article from an entertainment website called \"There is News\" which explicitly states that its content is fictional and does not correspond to reality.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a student at the University of Miami actually created a hybrid marijuana-strawberry plant, but there is no credible evidence or proof provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image of the hybrid plant is fake and not a genuine representation of a marijuana-strawberry crossbreed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the claim is a result of junk news and that there have been similar stories in the past involving improbable plant pairings, indicating that this claim is likely another example of such stories."}
