{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Mike Huckabee raised taxes specifically on dog groomers, when in reality, he implemented a sales tax on a range of services, including pet grooming.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Mike Huckabee raised taxes on dog groomers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising taxes on dog groomers is inherently negative, without providing any reasoning or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tax increase, such as the need to generate revenue to balance the budget in the face of a projected shortfall."}
