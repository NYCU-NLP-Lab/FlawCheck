{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mufti Asad Qasmi is not associated with Darul Uloom Deoband, as clarified by the institution itself.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the criticism by presenting it as a slam or attack on Nusrat Jahan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on the statements of an obscure Mufti who is not associated with Darul Uloom Deoband.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nusrat Jahan celebrating Durga Puja is defaming Islam, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the criticism against Nusrat Jahan may be based on personal opinions rather than representing the views of Darul Uloom Deoband."}
