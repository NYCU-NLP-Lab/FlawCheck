{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the certainty and accuracy of the graphics in showing the exact probability of COVID-19 carriers spreading the disease based on mask usage. The expert explains that there are many variables and a lack of experimental data that make the risk of contagion hard to calculate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and variability of factors that affect the risk of contagion, such as the amount of virus shed by the carrier, distance between individuals, type of mask material, and fit of the mask. The expert emphasizes that the actual numbers will depend on these factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the exact probability percentages mentioned in the graphics. The expert states that there are no reliable numbers on how much protection a face mask provides, and the risk of contagion is hard to calculate due to the lack of experimental data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wearing masks can significantly reduce the risk of contagion, without considering the effectiveness of different types of masks and their proper usage. The expert mentions that not all masks are created equal and that N95 masks are considered the gold standard.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19, such as other modes of transmission or the effectiveness of other preventive measures. The expert's statement focuses specifically on mask usage and does not address other potential factors."}
