The expert's verdict confirms that this is indeed the case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that it is ironic for First Energy Corp. to have their name on the stadium because Cleveland Public Power supplies the electricity. However, this assumption may be subjective and not universally agreed upon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the ironic nature of the situation. It is a statement made by Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek, but no further evidence or explanation is provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the naming of the stadium. It assumes that the only relevant factor is the electricity supply, but there may be other reasons why First Energy Corp. was chosen for the naming rights."}
