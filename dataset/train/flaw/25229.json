{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the church was behind a divisive scheme to separate Lingayats from Hindus, which may be an exaggerated accusation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a leaked email, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or additional sources to support the allegation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the leaked email is genuine and accurately represents the intentions of the church, without considering the possibility of forgery or manipulation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the separate religious status granted to Lingayats, such as the community's own demands or political factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas, who dismissed the claims as fake and diabolic.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its credibility due to the involvement of political figures and the deletion of the original tweet by Swami Nishchalanand after the official clarification was issued."}
