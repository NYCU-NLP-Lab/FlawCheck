However, the expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations or information to confirm or refute the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts established facts by falsely asserting that Ford had filed similar sexual misconduct accusations against Neil Gorsuch and by sharing misleading images and information about her attending anti-Trump rallies and exhibiting drunken behavior.
