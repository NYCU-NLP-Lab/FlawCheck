{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the Spanish police are \"beating people\" who violate the curfew. The evidence provided only shows a video of an incident where three men dressed like the police beat up a man, which does not necessarily represent the actions of the entire Spanish police force.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Spanish police are consistently beating people who violate the curfew. The evidence provided only shows one incident and does not provide any further information or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions of a few individuals in the viral video represent the behavior of the entire Spanish police force. This assumption may not be accurate and could lead to a biased understanding of the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions shown in the viral video. The video is from a July 2019 incident and predates the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting that it may not be directly related to the curfew enforcement during the pandemic."}
