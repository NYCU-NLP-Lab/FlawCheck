{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of candidates from Congress by stating that only 230 candidates will be contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, while the actual number is 379.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the claim that 230 candidates from Congress will be contesting the elections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that no party other than the BJP is fighting for a complete majority, without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as it is mentioned that the BSP will contest 38 seats, the SP will field 37 candidates, the TMC will contest 42 seats, and the RJD will contest from 20 seats. This suggests that other parties are also contesting for a majority in the Lok Sabha elections."}
