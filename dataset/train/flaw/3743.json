{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the United States is not building any aircraft, long-range bombers, additional aircraft carriers, or nuclear submarines, when in fact, there are ongoing projects for building these military equipment.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they contacted various sources and experts to gather information on the current status of building military equipment, but did not receive a response from Rubio's campaign and Senate offices. This lack of response may indicate a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the United States is the only nation not building the mentioned military equipment, without providing any comparative data or evidence to support this assumption. It may be problematic to make such a broad assumption without proper context or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the United States is indeed building aircraft, bombers, aircraft carriers, and nuclear submarines, contradicting the claim. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim is not accurate."}
