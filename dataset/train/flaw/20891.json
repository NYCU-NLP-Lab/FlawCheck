{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because the photographs used in the posts are not all related to the 1918 flu pandemic. Six images were found to be unrelated to the pandemic, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation bias exists because some of the photographs used in the claim have different explanations. For example, the image of two women wearing pointed plastic cones is from 1939 and was used for protection against snow, not specifically related to the flu pandemic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that all the photographs used in the posts are related to the 1918 flu pandemic. The presence of unrelated images, as confirmed by reverse image searches, contradicts the claim's assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact and severity of the 1918 flu pandemic by only focusing on the photographs without providing additional context or information about the scale of the pandemic.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim as it mainly focuses on the photographs and their relation to the 1918 flu pandemic.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it includes unrelated images that do not accurately represent life during the 1918 flu pandemic. This inconsistency weakens the overall credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that all the photographs used in the posts accurately depict life during the 1918 flu pandemic. However, the presence of unrelated images challenges this assumption."}
