{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the development of a 3D synthetic rhino horn will eventually undercut the market for poached horns. This is supported by the expert's verdict, which mentions that it is unclear whether producing fake rhino horn will decrease demand for real rhino horn and whether the synthetic product can be legally sold under existing anti-poaching laws.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the development of synthetic rhino horn will lead to a decrease in demand for real rhino horn and force poachers out eventually. However, this assumption is challenged by conservation and wildlife groups, as mentioned in the expert's verdict, who reject the idea and state that it's uncertain whether the synthetic product will decrease demand for real horn.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that conservation and wildlife groups express opposition to the introduction of fake rhino horn to international markets because it could actually lead to more poaching by increasing demand for the real horn. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations and consequences to the development of synthetic rhino horn.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential negative consequences of producing and selling synthetic rhino horn. The expert's verdict mentions concerns raised by conservation and wildlife groups, such as the potential normalization or removal of stigma from buying illegal real horn, the difficulty in distinguishing between legal synthetic horn and illegal real horn, and the lack of commitment from companies benefiting from synthetic horn to help conservation efforts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that at least four companies have announced their intent to manufacture synthetic rhino horn, as stated in the expert's verdict. This suggests that the claim may not acknowledge the existing development and interest in synthetic rhino horn.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of synthetic rhino horn on undercutting the market for poached horns. The expert's verdict mentions that the synthetic product is planned to be sold at one-eighth of the price of the original, but it is unclear whether this pricing strategy will be effective in decreasing demand for real horn.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear from the provided information whether the claim falters at times in terms of providing accurate and reliable information about the development and potential impact of synthetic rhino horn. Further details or evidence would be needed to determine if this bias exists."}
