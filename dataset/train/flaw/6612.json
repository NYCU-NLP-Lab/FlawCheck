{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on viral photographs on social media, but there is no concrete evidence or verification to support the claim that a Gabbar Singh look-alike was spotted in Karachi, Pakistan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the photographs is a look-alike of Gabbar Singh, without providing any evidence or expert analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim mentions that the same woman can be seen in both photographs, indicating that they were taken at the same location. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the photographs, such as a photoshoot or a staged event, rather than an actual Gabbar Singh look-alike being spotted in Karachi."}
