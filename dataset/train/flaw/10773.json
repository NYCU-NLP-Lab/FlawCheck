{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA is sufficient evidence of support for disaster relief funding. However, the expert's verdict highlights that Cotton had also voted against disaster relief spending five times, indicating a potential inconsistency in his support for such funding.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Cotton's campaign did not respond to their questions, which suggests a lack of additional evidence or clarification to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Cotton had voted for disaster relief funding as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. This alternative explanation suggests that Cotton's support for disaster relief funding may be conditional and not as comprehensive as implied in the claim."}
