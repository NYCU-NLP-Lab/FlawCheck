{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the proposal, as the expert's verdict suggests that the legislation Stone co-authored would have taken Mitchell International Airport out of direct public control of county government.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that proposing regional operation for the airport is not the same as privatizing it, while the expert's verdict suggests that some critics accused Stone of seeking to privatize Mitchell by handing over management to an unaccountable, appointed board.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Stone never proposed privatizing the airport. The expert's verdict provides information about Stone's involvement in proposing a plan to put the airport under the control of an appointed airport authority, which could be interpreted as a form of privatization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that Stone's support for an airport authority could be interpreted as a form of privatization, while Stone vehemently denies this. This indicates the existence of alternative explanations for Stone's actions and statements."}
