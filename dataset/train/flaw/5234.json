{"Understate": "The claim understates the amount of land owned by white people in South Africa by stating that they own only 22% of the land, while the expert's verdict indicates that white South Africans own a greater percentage of land than the claim suggests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the focus should be on the 22% of land owned by white people, without considering the reasons or factors behind the distribution of land ownership in South Africa.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that white people own only 22% of South Africa's land. The expert's verdict mentions that racial ownership data is only available for about a third of the land in the country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of land ownership in South Africa, such as the ownership of land by companies and trusts, which are not racially classified.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that white South Africans own a greater percentage of land than the claim suggests, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it simplifies the complex issue of land ownership in South Africa by focusing solely on the percentage owned by white people and not considering other factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by oversimplifying the issue of land ownership and not providing a comprehensive analysis of the situation."}
