{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only mentions that plagues occur every 100 years without providing any evidence or data to back up this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that plagues occur every 100 years based on a meme, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the occurrence of plagues.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it cherry-picks a small amount of data (the four years referenced in the meme) while ignoring a larger body of related data that may not fit the desired pattern.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that pandemics of some type were extant during all four of the years referenced in the meme, suggesting that plagues occur every 100 years.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim is not particularly useful in any informative or predictive sense, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the occurrence of plagues rather than a fixed 100-year pattern."}
