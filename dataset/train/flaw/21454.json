{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the release of a sequel to \"Titanic\" called \"Titanic 2: The Return of Jack\" in 2020, which is not actually happening.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or official announcement to back up the existence of the sequel.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sequel is scheduled for release in 2020 without providing any reliable sources or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the video circulating on social media is a parody trailer created by a YouTube user, rather than a genuine upcoming sequel."}
