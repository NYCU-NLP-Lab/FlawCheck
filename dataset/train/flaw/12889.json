{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Tom Barrett voted to allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born. There is no specific evidence or vote cited to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific vote or evidence to back up the assertion that Tom Barrett voted to allow late-term abortions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tom Barrett's vote against the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 1995 means that he supported abortions through the ninth month. This assumption may not necessarily be accurate or supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Tom Barrett's vote against the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, such as concerns about the constitutionality of the legislation or disagreement with specific provisions within the act. However, the claim does not consider or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
