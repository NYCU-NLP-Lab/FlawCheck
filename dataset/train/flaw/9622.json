{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of murders that could have been prevented by communities working with ICE and Homeland Security. The expert's verdict states that there is no study or report from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) showing that murders could have been prevented in this manner.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the assertion that 120 murders could have been prevented by community cooperation with ICE and Homeland Security. The expert's verdict states that there is no study or report from DHS or ICE supporting this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of cooperation with immigration authorities by sanctuary cities directly leads to murders that could have been prevented. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no study or report from DHS or ICE showing that murders could have been prevented by community cooperation with immigration authorities. The expert's verdict directly contradicts the claim made by Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a misleading interpretation of a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is not about sanctuary cities' lack of cooperation with ICE. The expert's verdict highlights this flaw in the claim's argument.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the murders mentioned, such as other factors that may have contributed to the crimes. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations but highlights the lack of evidence supporting the claim."}
