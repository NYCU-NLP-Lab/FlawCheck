{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the decrease in the average time someone holds a share of stock from 8 years in the 1960s to 4 months currently. The data provided by the NYSE and Credit Suisse suggests a decrease, but not to the extent claimed by the senator.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides data from the NYSE and Credit Suisse, without considering other sources or alternative explanations for the decrease in share-holding time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in share-holding time is solely due to investors focusing on quick profits at the expense of long-term value. It does not consider other factors such as changes in trading venues, the influence of mutual funds and hedge funds, or the growth of e-trading.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the quickening turnover of shares, as mentioned by stock market analysts and academics. These include the shift from small individual investors to institutional investors like mutual funds and hedge funds, which may exert pressure on companies for short-term profits. The growth of e-trading is also mentioned as a contributing factor."}
