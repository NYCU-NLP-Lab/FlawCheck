{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the vast majority of marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. While it is true that many people were protected from premium increases through tax credits, the claim does not provide specific data on the percentage of enrollees who did experience premium hikes.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the fact that premiums did rise, even though most people purchasing health care through the marketplace didn't feel it. It acknowledges that premiums went up but does not provide specific information on the magnitude of the increases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that the vast majority of marketplace enrollees experienced no average premium hike at all. It relies on general statements and anecdotes without providing comprehensive data on premium changes for all enrollees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"vast majority\" of marketplace enrollees experienced no average premium hike based on the fact that many people were protected from increases through tax credits. However, it does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes the \"vast majority\" or provide specific data on premium changes for all enrollees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why some marketplace enrollees may have experienced premium hikes. It focuses primarily on the impact of tax credits and does not explore other factors that could have contributed to premium changes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that premiums did rise on average by stating that the vast majority of marketplace enrollees experienced no average premium hike at all. This contradiction is acknowledged in the expert's verdict, which states that premiums did rise but many people were protected from the increases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing complete data on the actual premiums people pay, as details on about 3 million people who signed up through state-based exchanges are missing. This lack of complete data weakens the claim's assertion that the vast majority of marketplace enrollees experienced no premium hike."}
