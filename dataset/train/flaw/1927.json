{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that individuals with a high net worth are more likely to be insubordinate.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it is based on rumors and anecdotes rather than concrete facts or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that individuals with a high net worth are automatically ineligible to serve in the military, which may not be universally true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The examples provided in the expert's verdict suggest that there are alternative explanations for individuals with high net worth serving in the military, such as personal choice or family tradition.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that active duty servicemen/women can be honorably discharged if they receive an unexpected windfall, indicating that high net worth alone does not make someone ineligible to serve.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the connection between high net worth and insubordination, as there is no concrete evidence or statistical data provided to support this correlation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential exceptions to the rule by not acknowledging the examples of wealthy individuals who have served in the military throughout history."}
