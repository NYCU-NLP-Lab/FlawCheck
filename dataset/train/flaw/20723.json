{"Understate": "The claim may understate the reasons behind Ayotte's vote against the proposal to expand background checks. The expert's verdict mentions concerns about the broadness of the Murphy legislation and the importance of fixing the current system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully evaluate the context and reasoning behind Ayotte's vote. The expert's verdict provides some information, but more details are needed to fully assess the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that expanding background checks would prevent dangerous individuals, including suspected terrorists, from purchasing guns. However, this assumption is not directly addressed or supported in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions Ayotte's support for an alternative amendment in 2013 that focused on increasing mental health records and prosecuting background check violations. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Ayotte's votes on background check proposals."}
