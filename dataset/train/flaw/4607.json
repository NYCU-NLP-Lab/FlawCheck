{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the racial disparity in student debt by stating that 95% of African Americans have debt after 20 years, when the actual statistic is 74%.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 51% of white student-loan holders still have debt after 20 years, while the claim states that only 5% of whites have debt.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it misstates the statistics from the Brandeis University study and does not provide any additional evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the racial disparity in student debt is solely due to systemic racism, without considering other factors such as income disparities or differences in borrowing behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the racial disparity in student debt, such as differences in educational attainment or access to financial resources."}
