{"Understate": "The claim may understate the average development allocation by counties by stating that it has been 40% surpassing the legal requirement of at least 30%. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the average allocation to the agriculture sector is only 6.7%, which is significantly lower than the claimed 40%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim of the average development allocation by counties being 40%. The expert's verdict provides evidence of allocations to specific sectors like agriculture and health, but does not directly support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legal requirement for development allocation is at least 30%, without providing any context or explanation for this requirement. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the specific needs and priorities of different counties.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by presenting data on allocations to specific sectors like agriculture and health. This suggests that the average development allocation may vary depending on the sector being considered, and the claim's focus on overall development allocation may not provide a complete picture."}
