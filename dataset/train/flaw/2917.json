{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the pro-Trump rally by suggesting it was massive and that the mainstream media intentionally ignored it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video clip is from a rally that took place in 2018, not during Trump's recent visit to London in 2019.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the mainstream media deliberately ignored the rally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mainstream media has a bias against reporting on pro-Trump events, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the media did report on the rally when it happened in 2018, but the video clip resurfaced later with misleading captions."}
