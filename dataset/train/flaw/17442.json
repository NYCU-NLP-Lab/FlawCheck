{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people that would be covered by Trump's legislative proposal for the DACA program. The expert's verdict states that the 1.8 million figure represents the number of people that the White House claims could be eligible, but it is about the same number as those who are potentially eligible under the current DACA program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the previous administration did not cover as many people as Trump's proposal would. However, the expert's verdict points out that the comparison is faulty and misleading because the number of potentially eligible individuals is similar under both administrations.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the White House has not released any details about the eligibility requirements in Trump's proposal, so it is not possible to verify how many people would actually be eligible. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support to back up its statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of potentially eligible individuals under Trump's proposal is similar to the number under the previous administration's DACA program. The expert's verdict states that the comparison made in the claim is faulty and misleading.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a faulty and misleading comparison between the number of people covered by Trump's proposal and the previous administration's DACA program, as pointed out in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the number of people covered by Trump's proposal. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the comparison is misleading and explains the similar number of potentially eligible individuals under both administrations."}
