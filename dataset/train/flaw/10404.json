{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which tear gas is used by law enforcement officers in the United States, as it only mentions its use in Ferguson, Missouri.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that tear gas is allowed to be used by U.S. police forces.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tear gas being classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict means its use should also be prohibited by U.S. police forces, without considering potential differences in context or regulations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or justifications for the use of tear gas by U.S. police forces that are not addressed in the claim or expert's verdict."}
