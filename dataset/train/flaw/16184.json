{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that Donald Trump tweeted in 2012, \"We don\u2019t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it.\" However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that Obama won the 2012 election handily, contradicting the claim that Obama would steal the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that Donald Trump tweeted this in 2012. It is solely based on the author's mention of a Twitter meme and their own interpretation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2012 tweet by Donald Trump is relevant to the 2020 election and the request for a recount. It assumes a connection between the two events without providing any evidence or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the request for a recount in Wisconsin, such as the state flipping back to the Democrats in 2020 and the narrow margin of victory for Joe Biden. This suggests that there are other factors at play in the decision to request a recount, rather than solely relying on the 2012 tweet."}
