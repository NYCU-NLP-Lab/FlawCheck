{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they admire the pope, based on the Gallup poll results. However, the difference between the two was very small (both were named by 2 percent of respondents), so it may be an overstatement to claim that Americans admire Beck more than the pope.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of a faltering bias in the provided claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by the Gallup poll results, which show that Beck and the pope were both named by 2 percent of respondents. However, the claim does not provide further evidence to support the statement that Americans admire Beck more than the pope.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Gallup poll accurately reflects the admiration of Americans towards Glenn Beck and the pope. However, polling experts mentioned in the expert's verdict suggest that the comparison between Beck and the pope may be a big leap and not accurately represented by the poll results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the Gallup poll results or the comparison between Beck and the pope."}
