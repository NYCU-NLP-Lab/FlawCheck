{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that University of Texas students signed a petition seeking the legal right to abort newborn babies up to five-years-old, which is an extreme and exaggerated statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a video posted on YouTube by InfoWars.com, a conspiracy theorist website, which may not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions of a few University of Texas students represent the views and intentions of the entire student body, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives, such as the possibility of misrepresentation or manipulation in the video."}
