{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the new Trump administration rules on birth control coverage for women in New York state. The expert's verdict mentions that companies with more than 100 employees who are self-insured are not regulated by the state's birth control mandate. This means that a significant portion of women in New York state who are covered by self-insured plans may not have cost-free access to reproductive health care.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that women in New York state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care. The expert's verdict mentions that the state's birth control mandate covers 1.35 million residents in plans sold to individuals and companies with 100 or fewer employees, and about 2.5 million people in plans offered through companies with more than 100 employees. However, it does not provide comprehensive data on the total population of women in New York state and whether all of them will have cost-free access to reproductive health care.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state's birth control mandate will fully protect women in New York state from the impact of the new Trump administration rules. However, the expert's verdict highlights that self-insured plans, which a significant portion of women in New York state may be enrolled in, are not regulated by the state's birth control mandate. This assumption may not hold true for all women in the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that women in New York state may still face challenges in accessing cost-free reproductive health care due to the new Trump administration rules. The expert's verdict mentions that self-insured plans, which a significant portion of women in the state may have, are not regulated by the state's birth control mandate. This suggests that there may be limitations or barriers to cost-free access for some women in New York state."}
