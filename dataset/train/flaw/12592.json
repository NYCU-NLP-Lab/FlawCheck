{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a manual search of news reports, which may not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of all toddler-involved shootings. The lack of centralized records also adds to the uncertainty of the data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing toddler-involved shootings to terrorism is a valid and meaningful comparison. It may not be appropriate to equate the two in terms of threat level or societal impact.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the number of Americans killed by terrorists in 2015. The focus is solely on toddler-involved shootings, while other forms of terrorism-related deaths are not considered.", "Falters at times": "The claim may not consistently present the most up-to-date information. The number of toddler-involved shootings increased after the initial report, which suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate or reliable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths caused by toddlers, such as the availability of firearms or negligent gun storage. It solely attributes the deaths to toddlers themselves.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of toddler-involved shootings by framing it as a comparison to terrorism. This could potentially create a distorted perception of the relative risks and priorities in terms of public safety."}
