{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of the 1915 referendum on women's right to vote by stating that it \"went down\" in New Jersey, implying a complete failure, when in reality it received significant support and only narrowly missed passing in some counties.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the efforts and progress made by suffragists in New Jersey and other states leading up to the 1915 referendum, as well as the subsequent ratification of the 19th amendment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the referendum \"went down\" solely due to the opposition of men in New Jersey, without considering other factors or reasons for its failure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the failure of the 1915 referendum on women's right to vote in New Jersey is directly comparable to the issue of a state referendum on gay marriage, suggesting a problematic assumption that historical voting patterns and societal attitudes can be directly applied to different contexts and issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the failure of the 1915 referendum, such as the influence of political bosses, liquor interests, and other factors mentioned in the provided information."}
