{"Exaggerate": "The claim could be seen as exaggerating Kurt Russell's support for Trump based on a photo of him wearing a Trump T-shirt. The expert's verdict mentions that the photo is doctored and that it's not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts, which suggests that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook page that posted the photo did not provide evidence for its claim. This lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wearing a Trump T-shirt automatically means supporting Trump. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the photo is doctored and that the original photo shows Russell and Hawn wearing different outfits without any references to Trump or ISIS. This suggests that the assumption made in the claim is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photo, stating that it was taken years ago and that the altered photo attempts to depict Russell and Hawn as Trump supporters. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim."}
