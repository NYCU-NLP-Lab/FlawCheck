{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the demolition of the former dictator's house by using the term \"demolished\" without providing further context or evidence of the extent of the demolition.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actions and involvement of former President Aquino in the demolition of the house by only mentioning her as the successor of Ferdinand Marcos and not providing more information about her role or decision-making.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the house was demolished by the successor. It only provides a video of Imelda Marcos pleading with construction workers, but there is no clear connection to the successor's direct involvement in the demolition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the demolition of the house is a direct action by the successor without providing sufficient evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the demolition of the house, such as legal processes, government actions, or other factors not mentioned in the claim. The claim does not explore or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
