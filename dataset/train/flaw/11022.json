{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the disparity in capital funding between traditional public schools and charter public schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the subject is confusing and that there are more traditional schools than charter schools, which could suggest that the claim may be overstating the magnitude of the disparity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion of a \"great disparity\" in capital funding between traditional public schools and charter public schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers need to be analyzed to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a significant disparity in capital funding between traditional public schools and charter public schools without providing substantial evidence. The expert's verdict mentions that the subject is debated and that the numbers need to be examined to determine the validity of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that charter schools often have smaller enrollments compared to traditional schools, which could explain why traditional schools have more students per charter school. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the difference in capital funding between the two types of schools."}
