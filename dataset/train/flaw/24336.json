{"Understate": "The claim understates the potential impact of the bill introduced by Del. Kathy Tran, as it would have lowered the authorization for third-trimester abortions from three physicians to one and repealed the \"substantial and irremediable\" threshold.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that women are currently able to access abortions in the later stages of pregnancy under certain conditions with approval from medical doctors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the bill introduced by Del. Kathy Tran would not have changed Virginia's law on third-trimester abortions, when in fact it would have altered the authorization requirements and threshold for such abortions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as opponents of the bill argue that it would have made third-trimester abortions accessible to women who simply changed their mind about having a child, contradicting the claim that nothing would have changed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Tran's bill would have altered Virginia's law on third-trimester abortions by lowering the authorization requirements and repealing the \"substantial and irremediable\" threshold."}
