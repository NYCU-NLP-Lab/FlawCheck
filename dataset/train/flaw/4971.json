{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that \"wrong precinct\" rules exacerbate provisional ballot problems, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that HB 194 does nothing to solve the wrong-precinct problem.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the provisional ballot problems, such as issues with voter registration or voter education."}
