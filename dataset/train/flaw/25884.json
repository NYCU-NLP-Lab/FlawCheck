{"Lack enough support": "The claim that suicides have increased by 200% since lockdown does not have publicly available statistics or data to support it. The expert states that there are no publicly available suicide rate statistics for this year, and national data on suicide deaths might not be available until January 2022.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that suicides have increased specifically due to the lockdown measures. While it is mentioned that President Donald Trump claims that shutdowns lead to suicide, the expert points out that there is no data to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no publicly available suicide rate statistics or data to support the 200% increase since lockdown. The expert states that suicide deaths take a long time to identify and national data on suicide deaths are not available until 13 months after the end of the calendar year.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in suicides by stating a 200% rise since lockdown without providing any evidence or data to support this claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a statistic (200% increase) without any supporting evidence or data, which undermines its credibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise in suicides, such as other factors that may contribute to mental health issues during the pandemic."}
