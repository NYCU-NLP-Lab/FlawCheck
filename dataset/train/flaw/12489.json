{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Rick Perry provided in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict confirms that Perry did sign a law allowing certain undocumented immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates, but it does not provide information on the number or proportion of illegal immigrants who actually benefited from this policy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Rick Perry provided in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict provides more information on the law Perry signed, but it does not explicitly state whether the beneficiaries of the law were illegal immigrants or not.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that providing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants is a negative action. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account the potential benefits or reasons behind such a policy, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rick Perry's decision to provide in-state tuition for certain undocumented immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions Perry's argument that it is better to educate and integrate these individuals into society rather than burdening the state.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rick Perry did sign a law allowing certain undocumented immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. The expert's verdict confirms this fact.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information or context. The expert's verdict does not provide any indication of inconsistencies or errors in the claim."}
