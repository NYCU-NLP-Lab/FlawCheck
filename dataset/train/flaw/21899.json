{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of Texans without health insurance coverage before the pandemic and during the pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that the latest Census Bureau data from 2019 shows that about 19.9% of Texans under 65 are uninsured, which is approximately 1 in 5 people. However, the claim states that 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, which implies a higher percentage.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of Texans without health insurance coverage during the pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is supported by news articles highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured Texans. This suggests that the number of uninsured Texans may have increased during the pandemic, but the claim only states that \"nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don\u2019t have access to health care insurance.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of access to health care insurance is solely due to record unemployment and a failing health care model in Texas. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Texas is one of 13 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which may contribute to the high uninsured rates in the state. The claim does not acknowledge this alternative explanation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statement that \"nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don\u2019t have access to health care insurance.\" While the expert's verdict mentions news articles highlighting the growing population of uninsured Texans, it does not provide specific data or sources to validate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "As mentioned earlier, the expert's verdict suggests that the lack of Medicaid expansion in Texas may contribute to the high uninsured rates. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged in the claim, which solely attributes the lack of access to health care insurance to record unemployment and a failing health care model."}
