{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerated as it quotes Steve Bannon as saying that injectable birth control makes women fat and prevents them from getting \"man meat\" injections. However, the provided expert's verdict clarifies that Bannon did not make this exact statement himself, but rather an article published by Breitbart made these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Steve Bannon's statement reflects his personal beliefs and opinions. However, the expert's verdict explains that Bannon did not write the article himself and his involvement in its publication is not explicitly stated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that injectable birth control makes women fat and prevents them from receiving \"man meat\" injections. The expert's verdict only mentions the existence of an article on Breitbart making these claims, but does not provide further evidence or data to support or refute them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while Steve Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart when the article was published, he did not author it himself. This alternative explanation challenges the assumption that Bannon personally made the statement about birth control and \"man meat\" injections.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times as it presents the statement as a direct quote from Steve Bannon, when in fact, it was a quote from an article published on Breitbart. This misrepresentation could be considered a bias in the claim."}
