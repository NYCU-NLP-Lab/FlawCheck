{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of nations that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization. The expert's verdict mentions that there are only seven nations, but it does not provide evidence to support this number.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that the United States is one of only seven nations that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization. The sources cited mention the Charlotte Lozier Institute and the Center for Reproductive Rights, but it is unclear how these sources determined the number of nations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization is a negative or controversial practice. This assumption may be influenced by the perspective of the Family Foundation, a socially conservative group.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Australia could be considered an eighth nation that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks, but with qualifications. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that there are only seven nations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the global landscape of abortion laws. The expert's verdict mentions that the Charlotte Lozier Institute and the Center for Reproductive Rights, which have different perspectives, agree on some broad characterizations of global abortion laws. This suggests that the claim may not capture the complexity and diversity of abortion laws worldwide.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States allows elective abortions until at least 24 weeks of gestation, as determined by the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. The claim suggests that the United States allows elective abortions after 20 weeks, but the expert's verdict clarifies that states may set their own rules and generally restrict the procedure after 24 weeks.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect related to the provided information."}
