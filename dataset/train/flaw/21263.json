However, the expert's verdict highlights that Biden's immigration platform is still uncertain and the specifics of his changes are yet to be determined.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for Biden's stance on work visas.

The expert's verdict mentions that Biden's changes are still uncertain and that Trump will still have administrative powers through December 2020, indicating that any changes may not happen immediately or in the exact manner described in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the complexities and uncertainties surrounding Biden's stance on work visas.
