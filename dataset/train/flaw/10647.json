{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the video shows Nigerians scrambling for food amid the virus lockdown. The evidence provided only mentions that the video was shared on social media and that it has been circulating since March 2019, which does not directly support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is depicting Nigerians scrambling for food during the virus lockdown. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation that the video was filmed during the lockdown period or that it is related to the pandemic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video could have been taken during a different event or unrelated to the virus lockdown. The fact that it has been circulating since March 2019 suggests that it may not be directly linked to the current pandemic situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video has been circulating since March 2019, which is months before the start of the pandemic. This suggests that the video is not related to the virus lockdown.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or confirmation to support the assertion that the video shows Nigerians scrambling for food during the virus lockdown. The evidence provided is limited and does not directly prove the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any facts or information.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is exaggerating any facts or information."}
