{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of state workers who are \"idle\" at home during the coronavirus pandemic, as it is mentioned that \"few state employees are using this program\" and the number of unemployment claims in Wisconsin is high.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove the existence of state workers who are \"idle\" at home. The evidence provided includes statements from former Gov. Scott Walker and a memo from the Department of Administration, but it does not provide specific data or examples to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that state workers who are not working from home are \"idle\" without providing sufficient evidence or clarification on their specific circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for state workers not working from home, such as being sick with coronavirus, taking care of someone, or being deemed unable to work from home by a supervisor, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the situation and only presenting limited evidence and statements from a single source.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that state employees can qualify for paid administrative leave, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of state workers who are \"idle\" at home by not providing concrete evidence or data to support the claim."}
