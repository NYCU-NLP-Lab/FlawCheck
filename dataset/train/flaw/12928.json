{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not accurately represent Hillary Clinton's stance on the minimum wage. It fails to acknowledge her support for the Fight for $15 campaign and her endorsement from unions advocating for a higher minimum wage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton only supports raising the minimum wage to $12, when in fact she has shown support for higher minimums in individual states and cities through the Fight for $15 campaign.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that Hillary Clinton's position on the minimum wage is $12.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Hillary Clinton supports both a federal minimum wage increase to $12 and higher minimum wages through state and local efforts."}
