{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the crocodile, stating it was 28 feet long, while the expert's verdict suggests that there has never been a recorded crocodile of that size.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the crocodile was killed in Australia in 1957. The expert's verdict provides evidence suggesting that the photograph was taken in 1914 along the banks of the Roper River in the Northern Territory of Australia.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph was not taken in 1957 as stated, but rather in 1914.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph depicts the \"only known photograph\" of the 28-foot crocodile, which is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual size of the crocodile in the photograph, as the expert's verdict suggests that its size appears larger due to forced perspective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, suggesting that it was taken decades earlier and shows a crocodile of undetermined size that appears larger due to forced perspective."}
