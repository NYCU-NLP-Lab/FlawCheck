{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or support to prove that a gas boycott in April 1997 resulted in a 30 cent drop in gasoline prices overnight.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which shows that gas prices in April 1997 had minimal fluctuations and did not experience a significant drop.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a one-day gas boycott can have a direct and noticeable impact on gas prices, which experts argue is not the case.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of the 1997 gas boycott by suggesting that it led to a 30 cent drop in prices overnight, despite lack of evidence.", "Understate": "No evidence is provided to support the claim that a gas boycott in April 1997 had any impact on gas prices, suggesting that the claim may be understating the lack of effect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the fluctuations in gas prices in April 1997 were not due to a gas boycott, but rather normal market variations."}
