{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of property tax relief that the typical Wisconsin homeowner will receive, as the actual savings are estimated to be $33 over two years, not $680 over four years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to justify the $680 savings over four years, as it is based on assumptions and comparisons to a hypothetical scenario.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the assumption that another governor, faced with the same deficit, would have allowed local governments to raise property taxes at an 8 percent clip over an additional four years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the $100 million relief legislation does not result in lower median tax bills in 2014 compared to 2012.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the $680 savings are not actual money that the median taxpayer will save, but rather a hypothetical estimation based on assumptions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making comparisons to previous governors and budgets without providing a clear and accurate picture of the actual savings for homeowners."}
