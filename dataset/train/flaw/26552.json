{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the amount of money the government has spent, lent, or committed in its attempt to blunt the recession. The expert's verdict mentions that economists caution that the government is not necessarily \"out\" all of that money and that some of it may be recovered.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a statistic cited by South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford from a Bloomberg news service article. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure is taken from a specific article but does not provide any additional evidence or sources to support the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on the statistic cited by Gov. Mark Sanford, who is known for being highly critical of the Obama administration. This could potentially introduce bias or a lack of objectivity in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of money spent, lent, or committed by the government is directly related to its attempt to blunt the recession. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the government's actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the government's spending, lending, or commitments. It assumes that these actions are solely aimed at blunting the recession without considering other potential reasons or motives behind the government's financial decisions.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the amount of money the government has spent, lent, or committed in its attempt to blunt the recession. The expert's verdict mentions that the $12.8 trillion figure includes money lent or committed by the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and the government through stimulus packages and TARP. However, it does not provide a comprehensive breakdown of all the government's financial actions related to the recession."}
