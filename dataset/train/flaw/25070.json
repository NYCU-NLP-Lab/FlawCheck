{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by suggesting that the Pentagon has explicitly stated that 20 percent of U.S. bases could be eliminated, when in fact the Pentagon report only mentioned excess space and infrastructure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data from the Pentagon report to back up the assertion that 20 percent of U.S. bases could be eliminated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of political will is the only reason why U.S. bases have not been reduced by 20 percent, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the slow cost-savings in reducing U.S. bases, such as the need for a comprehensive plan by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission or potential political obstacles."}
