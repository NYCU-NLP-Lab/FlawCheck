{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the \"Deodorant Challenge\" is sweeping schools and playgrounds. The expert's verdict mentions that the supporting evidence for the trend being genuinely popular traces back to one single Facebook post, suggesting that the claim may overstate the widespread nature of the challenge.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the \"Deodorant Challenge\" is currently sweeping schools and playgrounds. The expert's verdict mentions that coverage of the challenge primarily stems from one parent's Facebook post, indicating a lack of diverse and substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"Deodorant Challenge\" is a prevalent and concerning trend among children. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the challenge may not be as common or new as portrayed, and the coverage primarily revolves around isolated incidents rather than a widespread phenomenon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the reported injuries related to the \"Deodorant Challenge.\" The expert's verdict mentions that there were previous instances of children intentionally burning themselves with aerosol deodorant for different reasons, which could suggest that the injuries are not solely caused by the challenge itself.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the \"Deodorant Challenge\" is a new trend.
