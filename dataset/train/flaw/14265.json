{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Act 10 on the disparities between public and private sector workers in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict mentions that Senator Johnson stated that the measure had only a slight impact, but it does not provide further evidence or analysis to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it relies on a single study conducted by conservative think tanks, the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The expert's verdict does not mention any other studies or sources that corroborate these findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the disparities in cost between public and private sector employees are solely due to differences in education and job classifications. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to compensation disparities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the comparison used in the study may not be appropriate as it compares state workers' compensation to pay and benefits at private sector firms with fewer workers. This alternative explanation suggests that the disparities in cost may be influenced by the size of the companies being compared.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Act 10 had a significant impact on the disparities between public and private sector workers in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict mentions that the total cost of public sector employees' employment was 29% higher before Act 10, and after the act, it is still 22% higher. This indicates a reduction in the disparities, contradicting the claim that Act 10 had only a slight impact.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
