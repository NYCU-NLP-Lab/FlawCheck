{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Georgia is one of only seven states to lose jobs in 2011, but it does not provide evidence or comparison to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Georgia has lost 8,200 jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the number of employed Georgians is solely due to Governor Nathan Deal's failure to create jobs, without considering other factors that may contribute to job losses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job losses, such as economic downturn or industry-specific challenges."}
