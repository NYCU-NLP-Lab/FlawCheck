{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Syrian refugees are \"unvetted\" by implying that they are not screened at all, when in fact they undergo a rigorous screening process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Syrian refugees being admitted to the U.S. are \"unvetted.\" The expert provides evidence that contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Syrian refugees are \"unvetted\" without providing any evidence or basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or acknowledge the existence of a more rigorous screening process for Syrian refugees."}
