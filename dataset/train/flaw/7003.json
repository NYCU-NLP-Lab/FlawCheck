{"Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the significance of the claim by suggesting that the video shows a \"freshly cut piece of raw meat spasming\" instead of acknowledging the viral nature of the video and its impact on social media.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict lacks enough support for the claim that the meat in the video is likely frog and not chicken. The expert mentions that some sources identified it as a frog, but also acknowledges that these sources may not have first-hand knowledge of the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that the neurons in the meat are reacting to sodium ions from salt and soy sauce without providing concrete evidence or scientific studies to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that the reaction of the meat to salt may be similar to a previous video showing frog legs twitching when salted, suggesting that there could be an alternative explanation for the phenomenon observed in the video."}
