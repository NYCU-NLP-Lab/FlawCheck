{"Understate": "The claim understates the reasons for Tim Kaine stepping down as DNC chair in 2011, as it fails to mention that he vacated the spot to run for a Senate seat at the behest of President Obama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Tim Kaine stepped aside to allow Debbie Wasserman Schultz to take the job spot in exchange for a slot on the 2016 ticket.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Debbie Wasserman Schultz's appointment as DNC chair in 2011, as it suggests that it was solely due to a deal between Kaine and Clinton, whereas the expert's verdict points out that President Obama played a significant role in Wasserman Schultz's selection.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donna Brazile served as interim chair of the DNC before Wasserman Schultz, as it implies that Kaine was the previous chair.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the influence and manipulation attributed to the alleged deal between Kaine and Clinton, as it presents it as a \"long-con plan to influence the 2016 election,\" whereas the expert's verdict suggests that it was a speculative theory without substantial evidence."}
