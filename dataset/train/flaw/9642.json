{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the laws passed in 1929 and 1958, suggesting that they designated all Confederate soldiers as United States veterans and made it illegal to remove Confederate monuments. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the laws did not confer any privilege other than markers for graves of Confederate soldiers and did not grant Confederate soldiers status equal to veterans of the United States military.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate its assertion that Congress passed laws in 1929 and 1958 designating all Confederate soldiers as United States veterans. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim and highlights the absence of legislation explicitly or implicitly granting Confederate soldiers veteran status.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the laws passed in 1929 and 1958 made it illegal to remove monuments to the Confederacy. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that these laws only provided for the erection of headstones and recognition of Confederate grave sites as U.S. War dead grave sites, without addressing the removal of Confederate monuments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for the laws passed in 1929 and 1958, suggesting that they were symbolic gestures or related to pensions for widows of deceased Confederate soldiers. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that the laws designated all Confederate soldiers as United States veterans.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information, such as linking to an extremely dubious website and misattributing the pardon of Confederate soldiers to President Andrew Jackson instead of President Andrew Johnson. These inaccuracies undermine the credibility of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the laws passed in 1929 and 1958 did not confer veteran status on Confederate soldiers or make it illegal to remove Confederate monuments. The expert's verdict provides evidence and historical context to refute the claim's assertion.", "Understate": "There is no significant evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
