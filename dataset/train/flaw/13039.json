{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the involvement of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in calling for a boycott of Chinese products. The image has been edited to make it appear as if the message was issued by the ITBP, but it was actually posted by the Swadeshi Jagran Manch.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence to suggest that the ITBP actually called for a boycott of Chinese products.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ITBP issued the message to boycott Chinese products, but it has been proven to be a fake image.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the message was actually posted by the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an organization that supports the RSS, and not the ITBP."}
