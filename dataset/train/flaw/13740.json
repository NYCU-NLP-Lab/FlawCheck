{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Mike DeWine's voting record by stating that he \"voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security.\" The expert's verdict explains that DeWine actually voted to table an amendment related to Social Security, not to allow undocumented immigrants to receive it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses. The expert's verdict explains that DeWine's position on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants is more nuanced and requires additional context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that DeWine's vote on the Social Security amendment and his stance on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants are contradictory to President Trump's views on immigration. However, the expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for DeWine's votes and positions on immigration. The expert's verdict provides additional context and explanations for DeWine's actions, suggesting that there may be alternative reasons for his decisions."}
