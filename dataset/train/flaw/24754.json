{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the percentage of \"illegal aliens\" in federal prisons supports the need for a national emergency to build a border wall. However, the actual percentage of inmates in federal prisons who are in the U.S. illegally is much lower than what is implied by the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of all noncitizens in federal prison by not considering the number of individuals charged with or convicted of federal immigration crimes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough support for the assertion that the percentage of \"illegal aliens\" in federal prisons justifies the need for a national emergency and the construction of a border wall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between the percentage of \"illegal aliens\" in federal prisons and the necessity of a national emergency and a border wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of \"illegal aliens\" in federal prisons is solely due to unauthorized border crossings, without considering alternative explanations such as immigration violations or other crimes committed by noncitizens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the percentage of all noncitizens in federal prison, which includes individuals charged with or convicted of federal immigration crimes, rather than solely focusing on unauthorized border crossings."}
