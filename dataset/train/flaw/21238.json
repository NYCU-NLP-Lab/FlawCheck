{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population contribute to illegal immigration. The expert's analysis suggests that while this is a significant factor, it may not be the \"number-one source\" as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which people who enter the country illegally contribute to the overall population of illegal immigrants. The expert's analysis indicates that approximately half to roughly two-thirds of illegal immigrants are those who entered the country illegally, which is not explicitly mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that the \"number-one source\" of illegal immigration is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population. The expert's analysis highlights the challenges in accurately estimating the overstay population and provides conflicting estimates from different sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that individuals who legally enter the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappear into the population are the primary contributors to illegal immigration. However, this assumption may overlook other factors or alternative explanations for illegal immigration, which are not explored in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for illegal immigration, such as individuals who enter the country illegally by crossing the Mexican border. The expert's analysis suggests that approximately one-third to roughly half of the country's illegal immigrants are those who entered the country illegally, which presents an alternative explanation that is not mentioned in the claim."}
