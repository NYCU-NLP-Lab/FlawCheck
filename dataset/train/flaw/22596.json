{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the troops involved in Jade Helm 15 might try to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores. This is an exaggerated claim as there is no evidence or factual basis to support such actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the activation of the Texas State Guard by Greg Abbott was solely to monitor the exercise due to concerns about martial law and the disarmament of Texans. This assumption is problematic as there is no evidence to support the idea that these were the only reasons for activating the State Guard.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that the troops involved in Jade Helm 15 would attempt to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores. There is no factual basis or credible sources provided to substantiate these claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Greg Abbott activated the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15. There could be other reasons, such as ensuring public safety or addressing concerns raised by residents, that are not mentioned in the claim."}
