{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of jobs created for African-Americans under President Obama, stating that he only created 195,000 jobs when in reality it was just shy of 3 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that President Trump has tripled what President Obama did for African-American employment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only measure of success for African-American employment is the number of jobs created, without considering other factors such as the quality of those jobs or the overall economic conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in job creation numbers between the two presidents, such as differences in economic policies or external factors beyond their control."}
