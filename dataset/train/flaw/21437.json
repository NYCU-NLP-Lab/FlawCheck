{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Joe Biden that the last two administrations deported twice as many people as the Obama administration is an exaggeration. While the number of people deported under various metrics may be higher during the Bush and Clinton administrations, Biden's claim does not accurately reflect the specific metric of formal removal orders.", "Understate": "Biden's claim could also be seen as an understatement when considering the broader deportation numbers, which include both formal removal orders and people turned away at the southwest border in a less formal process. In this sense, Biden's claim downplays the extent of deportations under the Obama administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of data and evidence to accurately compare the deportation numbers between different administrations. The expert's analysis highlights the complexities and different metrics involved in quantifying deportations, making it difficult to definitively determine the accuracy of Biden's claim.", "Problematic assumption": "Biden's claim assumes that the number of deportations is the sole indicator of success or failure in immigration policy. This assumption overlooks other factors, such as the context, enforcement priorities, and changes in immigration policies, which can influence deportation numbers.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis presents an alternative explanation by considering different metrics for measuring deportations. This alternative perspective challenges the accuracy of Biden's claim and highlights the need to consider multiple factors when assessing deportation numbers."}
