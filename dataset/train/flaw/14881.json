{"Lack enough support": "The claim that John Podesta's email password was \"password\" lacks material evidence to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Julian Assange's statement about Podesta's password being \"password\" is accurate, without providing any evidence to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that there are alternative explanations for Podesta's password, such as the passwords mentioned in other emails not being for his email account.", "Understate": "The claim understates the seriousness of the situation by saying \"That'd be funny if it were true,\" implying that it is not a significant security breach.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Google does not allow users to make their passwords \"password,\" suggesting that Podesta's email password could not have been \"password.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the simplicity of Podesta's password by stating that a 14-year-old kid could have hacked it, without providing evidence to support this assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive answer about Podesta's email password, as there is no conclusive evidence either way."}
