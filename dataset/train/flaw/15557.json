{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the similarity between Dan Patrick's proposed legislation and the Arizona law. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Patrick's legislation included language authorizing police officers to check immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion, which is similar to a vital part of Arizona's law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully establish the similarity between Dan Patrick's proposed legislation and the Arizona law. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Patrick's legislation died without a hearing in the 2011 legislative session, suggesting that it did not progress far enough to be fully compared to the Arizona law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that Dan Patrick's proposed legislation is directly comparable to the 2010 Arizona mandate. The expert's verdict provides evidence that while there are similarities, Patrick's legislation also had specific provisions related to turning over cases to federal Immigration Customs Enforcement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for Dan Patrick's proposed legislation. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Patrick's decision to file the legislation was based on his belief that it would not pass and be effective, suggesting there may be other motivations or considerations involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Dan Patrick's proposed legislation did not pass and therefore did not become law. The expert's verdict mentions that the legislation died without a hearing in the 2011 legislative session.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Dan Patrick's proposed legislation by characterizing it as \"Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that while there are similarities, Patrick's legislation had specific provisions related to suspicions of committing a crime and turning over cases to federal authorities.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and accurate representation of the details of Dan Patrick's proposed legislation. The expert's verdict provides a more detailed explanation of the provisions and intentions of the legislation."}
