{"Understate": "The claim may understate the ridership of Portland's public transit system by stating that it has never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership in the past 12 years, while the expert provides data showing an increase of about 12 percent in ridership over a 10-year period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any data or evidence to back up the statement that Portland has never achieved more than 12 to 15 percent ridership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ridership percentage is the only measure of success for a public transit system, without considering other factors such as population growth, demographics, or the availability of alternative transportation options.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the ridership percentage, such as changes in population density, urban planning, or economic factors that may have affected public transit usage in Portland."}
