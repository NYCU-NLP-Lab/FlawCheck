{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the role of firefighters in starting controlled fires to stop the spread of wildfires. The expert's verdict mentions that the video shows firefighters shooting fireballs from an aircraft, which aligns with the traditional practice of using controlled fires to create firebreaks or obstacles to the spread of fire. However, the claim implies that firefighters are intentionally starting fires to stop wildfires, which may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that firefighters are starting controlled fires to stop the spread of wildfires. The expert's verdict provides information about the video, its origin, and the traditional Chinese caption, but there is no direct evidence or official confirmation supporting the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video depicts firefighters starting controlled fires to stop the spread of wildfires, but this assumption may be problematic. The expert's verdict mentions that the video shows fireballs being fired from an aircraft over a forest, but it does not explicitly state that these fireballs are intentionally set by firefighters to control wildfires. The assumption that the video represents firefighters' actions may be unsupported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the video, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. The video is identified as a POV heli-torch cam showing firefighters shooting fireballs from a helicopter to stop larger fires. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the video depicts firefighters starting controlled fires to stop the spread of wildfires."}
