{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate back in 1993. The expert's verdict states that they listened to several hours of Clinton's testimony and read many news accounts from 1993, and they can say with confidence that Clinton opposed delivering universal coverage entirely through an individual mandate and supported an employer mandate instead. However, this information is not explicitly mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate in 1993. The expert's verdict provides evidence from Clinton's testimony and news accounts from 1993, but this evidence is not included in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may leave room for alternative explanations or interpretations. While the claim states that Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate in 1993, it does not provide any context or reasoning behind her stance. The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton's concerns and comments in 1993 may not necessarily foreshadow the impact of Obamacare on the healthcare industry, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for her position."}
