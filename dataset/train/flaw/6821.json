{"Contradict fact": "The claim that having a flu shot in the last 3-5 years will probably test positive for COVID-19 contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that there is no evidence of cross-reactions between immune responses to the two vaccines.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of a flu shot on COVID-19 testing, suggesting that it will probably lead to a positive result, while the expert's verdict states that there is no cross-reaction between influenza and the new coronavirus.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence from medical experts who state that there is no cross-reaction between the flu shot and COVID-19 testing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of coronavirus antibodies in flu vaccines would lead to a positive COVID-19 test, which is a problematic assumption as there is no evidence to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the link between flu shots and positive COVID-19 tests."}
