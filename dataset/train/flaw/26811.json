{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were emails marked classified on Hillary Clinton's private email server.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Clinton \"never received nor sent any material that was marked classified\" when there were actually emails with classification markings.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of emails that contained classified information by only mentioning a \"very small number\" and not acknowledging the 110 emails found in the investigation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence to back up the assertion that Clinton never sent or received classified material.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of markings on emails means they were not classified, ignoring the possibility of retroactive classification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the presence of classified information on Clinton's private email server was due to human error or lack of awareness."}
