{"Lack enough support": "The claim that students have developed nail polish to detect date-rape drugs is not fully supported by the evidence provided. While laboratory testing was underway and private investor funding was secured, the claim fails to provide concrete evidence of the completion and availability of the nail polish product.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim gives the impression that the nail polish is readily available, but the expert's verdict reveals that the nail polish idea was eventually abandoned in favor of a different product, the SipChip. This assumption in the claim overlooks the shift in focus and the discontinuation of the nail polish.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the students shifted their focus from nail polish to the development of the SipChip, a small disk that detects date-rape drugs. This alternative explanation is provided in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges and setbacks faced by the students in the development of the nail polish. The expert's verdict mentions that the start-up company burned through $8.2 million in investor funding before abandoning the nail polish idea. This suggests that the development process was not smooth and faced significant obstacles.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the nail polish is not the final product developed by the students. The expert's verdict states that the SipChip, not the nail polish, is the product that was released for sale in September 2018.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the availability and effectiveness of the nail polish in detecting date-rape drugs. The expert's verdict provides information about the SipChip, which is a different product that works in a similar way to a pregnancy test. The claim's focus on the nail polish may exaggerate its importance and effectiveness compared to the actual product developed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the progress and outcome of the students' project. It presents the nail polish as the final product, while the expert's verdict reveals that the students shifted their focus and developed the SipChip instead. This inconsistency in the claim's representation of the project's progress indicates a faltering in its accuracy."}
