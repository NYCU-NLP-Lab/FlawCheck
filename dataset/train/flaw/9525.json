{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the U.S. Postal Service relies on tax dollars. While it is true that the Postal Service is not directly funded by tax dollars for its operations, there is a mention of Congress providing $100 million a year to compensate for revenue loss and other services. This suggests that there is some level of indirect funding from tax dollars.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to fully substantiate the assertion that the Postal Service is solely funded by stamps and postage. While it is mentioned that the Postal Service generates revenue through the sales of postage stamps and services, there is no specific information provided to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Postal Service's funding model is solely based on stamps and postage without considering other potential sources of revenue or funding. It does not take into account any alternative revenue streams or financial arrangements that may exist.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the Postal Service's financial situation. It solely attributes the funding to stamps and postage without exploring other potential factors such as changes in mail volume or operational costs."}
