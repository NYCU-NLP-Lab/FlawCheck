{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"Pro-Pakistan slogans\" were raised at a London event in support of protesting Indian farmers. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the video in question has been shared with misleading captions and there is evidence of the video being shared in different contexts in the past.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals chanting slogans in the video represent the entire Sikh community, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the video, such as it being filmed during a protest against the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government's ongoing lockdown in Indian-administrated Kashmir."}
