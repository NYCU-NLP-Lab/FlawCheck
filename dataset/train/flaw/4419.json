{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the $12 billion bailout on every household in the U.S. by stating that it will cost $95 per household. The expert's verdict explains that this calculation is based on dividing the total aid by the number of U.S. households, but it does not necessarily mean that each household will directly bear this cost.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $12 billion bailout is a \"failed\" response to Trump's tariffs without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the statement that Trump is borrowing the money from China due to the deficit caused by his tax cuts. The expert's verdict explains that the aid package is not specifically financed by Chinese purchases of Treasury securities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the aid package, such as the need to support farmers who were affected by China's retaliatory tariffs. The expert's verdict provides context and explains the purpose of the aid package.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's statement that the aid package should not be referred to as a \"bailout\" since farmers did not initiate the tariffs that led to their need for assistance. The expert argues that the term \"bailout\" is not appropriate in this context.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in its presentation."}
