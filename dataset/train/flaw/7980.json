{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Russ Feingold cut Medicare by $523 billion is an exaggeration. The health care law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but rather aims to slow the program's future growth by curtailing spending by that amount over 10 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cuts to Medicare were solely the result of Russ Feingold's vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It fails to acknowledge that the vote was part of a larger effort by Democrats and that the law aims to improve the program for beneficiaries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that Russ Feingold cut Medicare by $523 billion. The expert's verdict provides information contradicting this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the changes in Medicare spending. It solely attributes the cuts to Russ Feingold's vote on the health care law, disregarding other factors and context surrounding the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits. The health care law actually expands some benefits and tries to improve the program for beneficiaries.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates anything."}
