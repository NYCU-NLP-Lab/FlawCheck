{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that health insurance companies have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments. The expert's verdict states that insurance companies will waive costs for coronavirus tests, not treatment.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that health insurance companies have not agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments. The expert's verdict clarifies that treatment costs may still require co-pays and cost-sharing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific sources to back up the assertion that the health insurance industry has agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments. The expert's verdict provides evidence from health insurance lobbying groups that no industry-wide plans exist for waiving treatment costs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health insurance industry has agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments based on a statement made by President Trump. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the statement was referring to waiving co-pays for coronavirus tests, not treatment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that health insurance companies may still require co-pays and cost-sharing for coronavirus treatments. The expert's verdict provides this alternative explanation by stating that health plans will cover treatment for coronavirus but may not waive co-pays or cost-sharing."}
