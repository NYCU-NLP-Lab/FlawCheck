{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the high school graduation rate of Newark high schools. The expert's verdict states that more than half of Newark's ninth grade students will actually graduate from high school in four years, but the claim states that only 23 percent will graduate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that more than half of Newark's ninth grade students will graduate from high school in four years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a single statistic without considering alternative factors or explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graduation rate is solely determined by the percentage of ninth-grade students who graduate in four years, without considering other ways recognized by the state Department of Education to earn a high school diploma.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by consistently misrepresenting the high school graduation rate of Newark's largest district, despite being debunked by fact-checkers twice before.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that there are multiple ways to earn a high school diploma, and the lower percentage cited by the claim only includes students who pass a state standardized test."}
