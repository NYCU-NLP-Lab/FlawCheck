{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the streetcar project by stating that Tom Barrett plans \"to spend $100 million on a trolley that goes barely two miles on the east side of Milwaukee.\" The actual cost of the project is reported to be $64.6 million for construction, with additional costs for debt service and utility relocation that are not certain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the $100 million cost figure. The evidence provided by the Walker campaign includes news articles citing various cost figures, but the final cost is not certain and could be lower.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spending $100 million on a streetcar project is excessive or wasteful without providing a clear justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents only one side of the argument by focusing on the cost of the streetcar project without considering the potential benefits or economic development goals that Tom Barrett may have for implementing the project."}
