{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the Trump administration's new policy for legal immigrants on welfare has been around for a while.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the United States has always had a policy of denying green cards to migrants who need welfare, without providing evidence or historical context to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Trump administration recently announced a new rule expanding the government's ability to deny visas and permanent residency to legal immigrants who receive public benefits. This contradicts the claim that the policy has been around for a while.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of the new rule by suggesting that it is not a new thing and that the United States has always been this way. However, experts argue that the new rule represents a significant expansion in how the public charge law is interpreted and applied.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a misleading interpretation of the policy and its historical context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation presented in the claim."}
