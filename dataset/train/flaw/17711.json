{"Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of money that is going to Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the expert acknowledges that most of the money is not going directly to Clinton's campaign, they also note that the money is being distributed to the Hillary Victory Fund, which supports Clinton's campaign committee.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the overwhelming amount of money is going to congressmen and senators.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taking back Congress is the main goal of the fundraising efforts, without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the money raised may not solely be going to congressmen and senators, as it is also being distributed to the Democratic National Committee and state parties. This provides an alternative explanation to the claim."}
