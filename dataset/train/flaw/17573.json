{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that the image of Bill Gates and the symbol of the novel coronavirus are intentionally featured on the Australian $10 note as part of a planned agenda.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image on the note is not Bill Gates but Australian writer Mary Gilmore.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that anyone promoting vaccines should not be trusted, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the inclusion of the symbol and image on the note is evidence of a planned agenda.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of the symbol and image on the note, such as their inclusion as security features and the depiction of Australian flora and historical figures."}
