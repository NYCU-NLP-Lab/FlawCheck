{"Lack enough support": "The claim of protesters raising Khalistani flags at the Red Fort lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support it. The only mention of this claim is from an ASG's statement in court, which does not provide concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Khalistani flags at the Red Fort is linked to the violence that took place on Republic Day. However, this assumption is not backed by strong evidence or a clear connection.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Alt News had debunked videos used to support the claim of protesters removing the Indian national flag and replacing it with the Khalistani flag at the Red Fort.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of flags other than Khalistani flags at the Red Fort. The video mentioned in the expert's verdict shows yellow and saffron-colored flags being hoisted below the tricolor, which could have different meanings or symbolism.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the presence of Khalistani flags at the Red Fort. The mention of \"hundreds of policemen injured\" in relation to the flag hoisting suggests a larger scale of the incident than the available information supports.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by solely focusing on the presence of Khalistani flags. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the events or the motivations behind the flag hoisting.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter or lack consistency in its presentation of evidence or supporting information. The mention of the ASG's statement in court is not followed by any further details or evidence to substantiate the claim."}
