{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the authority of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by suggesting that it can inspect safe deposit boxes without a warrant and seize any valuables inside.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support its assertion that the Department of Homeland Security has issued such orders to banks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Department of Homeland Security has the absolute right to seize customer bank accounts and inspect safe deposit boxes under the Patriot Act, without providing any evidence or legal basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim may have originated from the Cyprus financial crisis in 2013, where the government seized a portion of savers' assets. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's assertion that the Department of Homeland Security has the authority to seize valuables from safe deposit boxes."}
