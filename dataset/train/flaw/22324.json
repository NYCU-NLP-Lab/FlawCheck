{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump \"immediately discontinued\" an aid program to Central America. The expert's verdict clarifies that the aid program was reduced by about 23 percent during Trump's first two years, not completely discontinued.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the timeline of the aid program. The expert's verdict explains that the aid program was already decreasing before Trump took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that President Trump immediately discontinued the aid program. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the gradual reduction in funding, rather than an immediate discontinuation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that the surging immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border is solely caused by the discontinuation of the aid program. The expert's verdict points out that illegal border crossings surged even before the aid program was reduced.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that the reduction in the aid program was not the sole cause of surging immigration, as illegal border crossings had already increased before the aid program was reduced."}
