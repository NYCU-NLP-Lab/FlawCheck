{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the testing system was broken and didn't work. While there were issues and limitations with the system, it is not accurate to characterize it as completely obsolete and non-functional.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the system was completely broken. The expert's analysis and statements from former officials provide a more nuanced explanation of the limitations of the CDC's testing system.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the testing system should have been able to handle the wide-scale testing demands of the coronavirus pandemic. However, experts have pointed out that the CDC's role is not to be a commercial test lab and that relying solely on the CDC for testing in a pandemic like this would be unrealistic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the CDC's testing system was not designed or equipped to handle the volume of testing required during a pandemic. Instead, it places the blame solely on the previous administration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC's testing system was not completely broken and obsolete. While there were issues and delays in the early stages, the system was able to conduct some testing and was later expanded with the involvement of the private sector.", "Understate": "The claim understates the efforts made by the current administration to address the testing challenges. The expert's analysis highlights the steps taken by the administration to involve the private sector, increase testing availability, and develop new testing systems."}
