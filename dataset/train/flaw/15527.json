{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the $5-a-night hotel/motel tax will \"hurt Georgia's convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state.\" This implies that the impact of the tax on convention business will be significant and detrimental.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the tax will have a negative impact on convention business. It only includes a quote from the President and CEO of the Tourism Leadership Council in Savannah, who claims that the charge would have a \"serious effect\" but does not provide any concrete evidence or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $5-a-night fee will add tens of thousands of dollars in costs for large groups. This assumption is not supported by specific evidence or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could potentially mitigate or offset the impact of the tax on convention business. It does not explore other potential factors that could influence convention attendance or spending."}
