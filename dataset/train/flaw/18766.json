{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a single study conducted by Steve Moyer in 2013, and there is limited information about the methodology and sample size of the study.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of \"total action\" is the only factor that determines the value or entertainment of a baseball game, which may be a problematic assumption as different individuals may have different preferences and enjoy other aspects of the game.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the amount of \"total action\" in a baseball game, such as the strategic nature of the sport, the importance of player positioning, or the anticipation and tension built during slower moments.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of action by focusing solely on the time between pitches, innings, and batters, without considering other aspects of the game that can be considered as action, such as fielding plays or base running.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that baseball is not a sport of continuous action like soccer, hockey, or basketball, as stated by Major League Baseball's official historian, John Thorn.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the statistic by comparing it to a TED Talk, a Broadway intermission, or the missing section of the Watergate tapes, which may not be directly comparable in terms of entertainment value or importance.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, such as the discrepancy between Moyer's study and the Fox Sports study, which found different amounts of action in baseball games."}
