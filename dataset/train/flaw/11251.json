{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the New START treaty by stating that it \"cut Russia's nuclear arms\" when the treaty's impact is described as modest and not expected to result in rapid or dramatic reductions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the New START treaty actually resulted in cutting Russia's nuclear arms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the New START treaty was solely responsible for any reductions in Russia's nuclear arsenal, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Understate": "The claim understates the limitations of the New START treaty by not acknowledging that Russia could still increase its deployed missiles, heavy bombers, and nuclear warheads within the treaty limits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any reductions in Russia's nuclear arsenal, such as existing Russian policies or other international agreements."}
