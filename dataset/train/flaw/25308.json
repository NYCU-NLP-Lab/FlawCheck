{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the Democratic National Committee is meeting to consider replacing Hillary Clinton, when in fact no such meeting has been called.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Democratic National Committee is actually holding a meeting to replace Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Democratic National Committee has the power to unilaterally replace Clinton as the presidential nominee, which is a problematic assumption as it depends on Clinton choosing to remove herself from the race.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the DNC's bylaws require public engagement and open meetings, making it unlikely for a secret meeting to be held to replace Clinton.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a tweet from journalist David Shuster, which was later deleted, as a source of information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the rumors and speculation about replacing Clinton, such as health concerns or political maneuvering, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential consequences or impact of the situation, as it only mentions the possibility of a meeting without exploring the broader implications."}
