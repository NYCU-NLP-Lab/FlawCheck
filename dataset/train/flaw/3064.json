{"Lack enough support": "The claim of having between 85,000 and 95,000 open jobs in Wisconsin lacks sufficient support as it is based on the statement of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and the state-run jobs database, but the actual number of jobs in the database at the time was 83,077.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the jobs listed in the state-run jobs database are available and suitable for job seekers in Wisconsin. However, it is mentioned that the database includes about 14,000 positions located in neighboring states, which may not be relevant for Wisconsin job seekers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The inclusion of out-of-state jobs in the database raises the possibility of an alternative explanation for the high number of open jobs. These jobs may not be truly available in Wisconsin, but rather performed through telecommuting or travel by individuals living in Wisconsin.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it states that there are roughly between 85,000 and 95,000 open jobs in Wisconsin, but the actual number of jobs in the database varies by season and was just under 90,000 on the day before the claim was made.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of open jobs in Wisconsin since the actual number in the state-run jobs database was 83,077, which is lower than the claimed range of 85,000 to 95,000.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the number of open jobs in Wisconsin.", "Contradict fact": "There is no direct contradiction of fact in the claim, but the actual number of jobs in the state-run jobs database does not align with the claimed range."}
