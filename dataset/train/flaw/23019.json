{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the screenshots by labeling them as a mere mistake or glitch in the testing process, rather than acknowledging the potential implications of prematurely released election results.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Indiana primary was rigged for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The expert's verdict states that the screenshots were not proof of rigging.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the premature release of election results by WNDU indicates rigging, without considering alternative explanations such as technical errors or testing procedures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the premature release of election results, such as testing primary night reporting functions or similarities to other instances of pre-released information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the screenshots were part of primary reporting tests carried out by WNDU, as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the screenshots by suggesting that they prove the primary was rigged, while the expert's verdict states they are not proof of rigging.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not indicate any inconsistencies or errors in the claim itself."}
