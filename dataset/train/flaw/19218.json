{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Science is 'very certain' that the measles vaccine doesn't cause autism\" lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or references to scientific studies or experts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a debate over the safety of the measles vaccine, but the expert's verdict suggests that the scientific consensus is clear and that the vaccine is safe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding the link between the measles vaccine and autism."}
