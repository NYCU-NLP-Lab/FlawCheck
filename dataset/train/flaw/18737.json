{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of people who were eligible to vote when the Constitution was written. The expert's verdict mentions that the book by Albert McKinley indicates that the potential voters varied from one-sixth to one-fiftieth of the population, suggesting that the claim's estimate of 20 to 25 percent may be an understatement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that only 20 to 25 percent of the people in the country could vote when the Constitution was written. However, the expert's verdict mentions that voting eligibility was restricted to males and generally based on landownership, and did not extend to slaves who were a fifth of the population. This suggests that the claim's assumption may not fully account for the exclusion of certain groups from voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the estimate of 20 to 25 percent of people being eligible to vote. The expert's verdict mentions that it is difficult to pin down the exact size of the pool of potential voters due to varying state rules and the lack of national standards at the time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the voting eligibility percentage when the Constitution was written. The expert's verdict mentions that voting was restricted to males based on landownership, and slaves were excluded from voting. This suggests that there were alternative factors influencing voting eligibility at that time."}
