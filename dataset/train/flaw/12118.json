{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because there is no general student body graduation data using the NCAA's parameters to compare it with the graduation rate of student-athletes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that student-athletes have higher graduation rates than their nonathlete peers without providing substantial evidence or comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the higher graduation rates of student-athletes, such as the support and resources provided by the universities and athletic programs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential challenges and difficulties faced by student-athletes in balancing their academic and athletic commitments, which could affect their graduation rates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a U.S. district court ruled against the NCAA, indicating that student-athletes should be allowed to profit from their own names and likenesses, which challenges the NCAA's argument about their amateur status.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the academic successes of student-athletes by stating that \"many, many, many thousands\" of them graduate, without providing specific numbers or percentages."}
