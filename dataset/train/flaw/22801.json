{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of eligible voters wrongly dropped from voting rolls in the 2000 Florida election. The expert's verdict mentions that the company hired to produce the list of probable and possible felons warned that many people on the list would not be felons. This suggests that the number of wrongly dropped voters may not be as high as claimed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls. It is not clear if there is enough support for this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons. It may be a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict mentions that the state lawmakers wanted more felons off the rolls and the company warned that many people on the list would not be felons.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the eligible voters being wrongly dropped from voting rolls."}
