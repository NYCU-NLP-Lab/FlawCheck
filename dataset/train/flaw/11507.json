{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the toll road by calling it the \"coolest toll road in Indonesia\" and claiming that it only happened in the era of President Joko Widodo.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the toll road is indeed the \"coolest\" or that it is a unique occurrence only happening under President Widodo.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of the toll road and its uniqueness are directly linked to President Widodo's leadership, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the road's location and purpose, as it falsely attributes it to Indonesia when it is actually a road in Turkey.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the road in question is not in Indonesia but in Turkey, as confirmed by a fact-check conducted by AFP.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the toll road project in West Java by focusing on false information about a different road in Turkey, instead of providing accurate information about the actual toll road being built in Indonesia."}
