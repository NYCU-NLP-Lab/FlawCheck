{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference between the number of times Congress has raised its own salary and the number of times the minimum wage has been raised. It states that Congress has raised its own salary 15 times, while only raising the minimum wage three times since 1988. However, the actual data shows that Congress has raised its own salary 15 times, but the minimum wage has been raised seven times since 1988.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of times the minimum wage has been raised since 1988. It asserts that the minimum wage has only been raised three times, but the actual data shows that it has been raised seven times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that Congress has raised its own salary \"to reflect rising costs\" or that it has been slow to raise the minimum wage. It relies on a Facebook post and does not cite any specific sources or studies to support its claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of times Congress has raised its own salary should be directly proportional to the number of times the minimum wage has been raised. It implies that Congress is prioritizing its own salary increases over raising the minimum wage, without considering other factors or reasons for the difference in frequency of increases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the minimum wage has been raised seven times since 1988, not just three times as stated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in frequency of salary increases for Congress and the minimum wage. It presents a one-sided argument without acknowledging the potential reasons or factors that may influence these decisions."}
