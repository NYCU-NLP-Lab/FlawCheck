{"Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations and conditions of the order issued by King Salman. The expert's verdict mentions that the decree does not apply to areas with existing regulations mandating male approval, but this aspect is not explicitly stated in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the order issued by King Salman will significantly increase women's access to services. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the order retains codified examples of the \"guardianship\" policies, which may still restrict women's freedom in certain areas.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific details or evidence to support the extent to which women's access to services will be increased. The expert's verdict provides some information but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the order and its potential impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the order issued by King Salman. The expert's verdict mentions that the order could be seen as a step towards allowing women more freedom, but it also highlights the need for further actions to eliminate the guardianship system completely.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the extent of women's access to services allowed by the order issued by King Salman.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it provides a straightforward statement about King Salman issuing an order allowing women more access to services."}
