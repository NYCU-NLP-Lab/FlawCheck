{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people that DACA recipients can bring in as their extended family. The expert's verdict states that DACA recipients can only petition for spouses and unmarried children, not their entire extended family.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the claim that DACA recipients can bring in their entire extended family. The expert's verdict states that there is currently a loophole for DACA recipients to become eligible for green cards, but it does not provide evidence or statistics to support the claim that this could add up to 3 or 4 million additional immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that every DACA recipient will bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. However, the expert's verdict points out that green card recipients can only petition for spouses and unmarried children, and it does not provide evidence to support the assumption that all DACA recipients will petition for their entire extended family.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that DACA recipients can only petition for spouses and unmarried children, which contradicts the claim that they can bring in their entire extended family."}
