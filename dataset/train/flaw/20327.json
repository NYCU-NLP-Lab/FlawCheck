{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Wisconsin's gas tax is among the highest in the nation. While it is true that Wisconsin has higher gas taxes compared to the national average, claiming it is \"among the highest\" may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or statistics to support the assertion that Wisconsin's gas tax has been among the highest in the nation for decades. It would require more evidence to substantiate this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having one of the highest gas taxes in the nation is inherently negative or undesirable. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the state's high gas taxes, such as the need for funding infrastructure projects or historical factors. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
