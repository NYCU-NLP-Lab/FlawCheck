{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the National Border Patrol Council did not respond to requests for information on the data behind the claim, and the Trump campaign did not provide any additional information either.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in interior deportations under Obama is a negative thing, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that ICE implemented the Obama administration's \"clearer and more refined\" civil immigration enforcement priorities, with emphasis on the removal of convicted felons over non-criminals. This alternative explanation could contribute to the decrease in interior deportations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the perception that Obama was the \"Deporter in Chief\" and highlights that interior deportations were actually down 40 percent and at a nine-year low. However, the expert's verdict questions the truth behind this claim and the lack of response from the National Border Patrol Council and the Trump campaign raises doubts about its accuracy.", "Understate": "The claim states that interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low. If this claim is accurate, it could be seen as an understatement of the decrease in interior deportations.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the National Border Patrol Council and the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for information or comments, which could indicate a faltering in providing additional support or clarification for the claim."}
