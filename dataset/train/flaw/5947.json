{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Democrats by stating that they \"voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen.\" This implies that all Democrats voted in favor of sending funds to non-reopening schools, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that schools that have not fully reopened are refusing to do so out of preference, without considering other factors that may influence their decision, such as local infection rates or the needs of students.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Democrats specifically voted to send reopening money to non-reopening schools. It relies on a tweet from Senator Rubio and does not present a comprehensive analysis of the voting process or the intentions of all Democrats.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that there may be alternative reasons for schools not fully reopening, such as concerns for the safety and well-being of students and staff, or logistical challenges in implementing necessary measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus."}
