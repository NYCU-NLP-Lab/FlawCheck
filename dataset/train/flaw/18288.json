{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the requirement for businesses to certify to the IRS that Obamacare was not a motivating factor for cutting staff. The expert's verdict states that businesses need to certify under penalty of perjury, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that this is an exaggerated requirement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that businesses are cutting staff solely to avoid Obamacare costs. The expert's verdict states that cutting the workforce for bona fide business reasons is acceptable, including if sales dip or an employee isn't performing well. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for cutting staff that are not related to Obamacare.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that businesses are cutting staff solely to avoid Obamacare costs. The expert's verdict mentions that the requirement to certify to the IRS exists, but it does not provide specific examples or data on how many businesses are actually cutting staff for this reason.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative reasons for cutting staff, such as sales dip or employee performance. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Obamacare is the sole motivating factor for cutting staff.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama administration has delayed the implementation of the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate, giving businesses more time to offer health insurance to their workers. This delay suggests that the claim may be overstating the immediate impact of Obamacare on businesses' staffing decisions.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any information or downplaying the impact of Obamacare on businesses' staffing decisions.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times or presents inconsistent information."}
