{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Obama's policies on the increase in poverty among Hispanics. The expert suggests that poverty increased for all demographic groups during that time period, not just Hispanics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully establish a causal link between Obama's policies and the increase in poverty among Hispanics. The expert points out that it is important to consider other factors, such as the vulnerability of Hispanics to economic downturns and the impact of cyclical industries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in poverty among Hispanics can be solely attributed to Obama's policies. The expert suggests that it is off-base to solely blame Obama for the increase in poverty among Hispanics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations for the increase in poverty among Hispanics, such as their higher vulnerability to downturns and their concentration in industries that were heavily affected by the economic downturn. This suggests that there are alternative factors contributing to the increase in poverty among Hispanics, beyond Obama's policies."}
