{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video circulating on social media without any concrete evidence or verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman in the video is the wife of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, which is a problematic assumption as it is later revealed that the woman is actually Sirisha Rao, a volunteer with AAP Haryana.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists as the woman in the video is not Wing Commander Abhinandan's wife but someone else entirely, which contradicts the initial claim."}
