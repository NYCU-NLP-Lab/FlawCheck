{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Dodd-Frank on the disappearance of community banks by stating that one bank disappears every day since the end of the financial crisis.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim mentions FDIC data as a source, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that one community bank or credit union disappears every day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the implementation of Dodd-Frank and the disappearance of community banks, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in community bank numbers was already underway before the Great Recession and Dodd-Frank, suggesting that there may be other factors at play in the disappearance of these institutions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Great Recession ended in June 2009, while Dodd-Frank was signed into law one year later. This contradicts the claim's timeline of the disappearance of community banks since the end of the financial crisis."}
