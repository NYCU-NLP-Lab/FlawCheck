{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"The Art of the Deal\" is the \"No. 1 selling business book of all time\" may be an exaggeration as there is no concrete evidence or verifiable data provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data from Nielsen Bookscan only counts sales since 2001 and only includes print copies sold by major booksellers, which covers only about 85 percent of the market. Therefore, there may not be enough comprehensive data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a best-selling author automatically makes a book the \"No. 1 selling business book of all time,\" without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that best-seller lists are periodical and that the New York Times doesn't track all-time sales. This suggests that there may be alternative books or factors that could challenge the claim of \"The Art of the Deal\" being the top-selling business book of all time."}
