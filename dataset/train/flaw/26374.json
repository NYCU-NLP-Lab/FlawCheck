{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential danger of dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO) by stating that it is lethal when inhaled, corrodes metal, and may form blistering vapors when heated. In reality, DHMO is simply water and does not possess these dangerous properties.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it provides no evidence or scientific research to back up the assertion that the Environmental Protection Agency will ban manmade snow due to the presence of DHMO. It only cites a hoax article and a quote from a University spokesperson, both of which are not credible sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of DHMO in manmade snow is a valid reason for the Environmental Protection Agency to ban it. However, since DHMO is just another term for water, this assumption is unfounded and lacks logical reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the article it cites is an April Fool's prank and that DHMO is not a legitimate concern in relation to manmade snow. This alternative explanation undermines the credibility of the claim."}
