{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of donations that went to the Clintons and their staff, stating that 85% of every dollar donated ended up with them, while only 15 cents went to charitable beneficiaries. The expert's verdict provides a different perspective, stating that more than 88% of the Clinton Foundation's expenditures go directly to their work.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the financial practices of the Clinton Foundation. The expert's verdict mentions that the foundation works differently from traditional foundations and keeps its money in-house to carry out its own humanitarian programs, which can make their finances more complicated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing evidence or specific sources to back up the percentages mentioned. The expert's verdict refers to an article from The Federalist that analyzed the Clinton Foundation's tax forms, but it is not clear if the claim is based on the same information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of the money donated to the Clinton Foundation went to travel, salaries, and benefits, without considering other possible uses or expenses. The expert's verdict mentions that the foundation's expenditures go directly to their work, suggesting that there may be alternative uses for the funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the Clinton Foundation keeps its money in-house and carries out its own programs, which may explain the lower percentage of funds going to traditional charitable works compared to other foundations."}
