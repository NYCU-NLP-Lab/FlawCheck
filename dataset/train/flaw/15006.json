{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that early travel restrictions on China saved hundreds of thousands of lives is an exaggeration, according to the expert's verdict. There is no support for such figures and the impact of travel restrictions on containing the pandemic is modest.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that there is no support for the claim that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved due to the travel restrictions on China. The few studies that have been done on the impact of travel restrictions show modest effects and there is a lack of specific studies on the U.S. restrictions alone.", "Problematic assumption": "President Trump's claim assumes that the travel restrictions on China were the primary factor in preventing a higher death toll in the United States. However, the expert's verdict highlights that travel restrictions alone cannot contain the spread of a disease and that other factors contribute to the overall impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the lower death toll in the United States, besides the travel restrictions on China. Factors such as social distancing measures, testing, and healthcare responses could have also played a role in preventing a higher number of deaths."}
