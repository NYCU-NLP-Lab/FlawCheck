{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Rick Scott on tuition increases by stating that he \"increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits.\" The expert's analysis shows that the actual increases were 8 percent in the first year and 5 percent in the second year, which does not qualify as a double-digit increase.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of the Board of Governors in determining tuition increases, as it is stated that technically it is the Board of Governors, not Scott, that gets to vote on a tuition differential increase. However, the expert notes that Scott appoints the board and has asked for their opinions on tuition raises in interviews, suggesting that he has influence over the decision-making process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the accusation that Rick Scott increased tuition by double digits. The expert's analysis provides evidence of an 8 percent increase in the first year and a 5 percent increase in the second year, but it does not provide additional information or data to support the claim of double-digit increases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by attributing the tuition increases solely to Rick Scott, without considering the role of the Legislature and the Board of Governors in the decision-making process. The expert's analysis highlights that the budget structure and decisions made by the Legislature also influenced tuition increases during Scott's tenure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the tuition increases, such as the budget structure set by the Legislature and the decisions made by the Board of Governors. The expert's analysis suggests that these factors played a significant role in determining tuition increases, and it is not solely attributable to Rick Scott."}
