{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that a tiger briefly chased a motorcycle. The evidence provided includes a video from a seemingly authoritative source and additional details from the organization that posted it, but there is no independent verification or multiple sources confirming the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video accurately depicts a real event of a tiger chasing a motorcycle. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation beyond the video itself and the information provided by the organization that posted it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the behavior shown in the video. The expert mentions that a conservationist claimed the tiger was \"mock charging\" rather than attacking the motorcycle. This alternative explanation suggests that the tiger's behavior may not have been aggressive or a genuine chase.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that previous instances of doctored or fake videos showing close encounters with wild animals have gone viral. While the expert states that the provided video shows no obvious red flags of being fake, there is still a recognition that such fakes exist, which implies a potential bias in being skeptical of viral animal encounter videos.", "Contradict fact": "There is no specific contradiction of fact identified in the expert's verdict regarding the claim. The expert does not state that the video is definitively true or false, but rather provides an analysis of its authenticity based on the available information.", "Exaggerate": "There is no apparent exaggeration bias in the expert's verdict. The expert presents a balanced assessment of the video and its potential authenticity, without embellishing or overstating the evidence.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias in the expert's verdict. The expert provides a detailed analysis of the video and its context, addressing potential skepticism and highlighting the lack of obvious signs of fakery."}
