{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it suggests that the Indian activist Kanhaiya Kumar is shown with a map depicting Indian states as part of Pakistan. However, it is mentioned that the image was doctored to include the map, indicating that the original image did not have the map in the background.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a photo with a misleading caption. There is no additional evidence or context provided to support the claim that Kanhaiya Kumar is associated with the map showing Indian states as part of Pakistan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the presence of the map in the background of the photo implies Kanhaiya Kumar's support for the idea of Indian states being part of Pakistan. However, without further context or statements from Kumar himself, it is not possible to accurately determine his stance based solely on the presence of the map.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the map in the background of the photo. It is mentioned that the image was doctored, so it is possible that it was manipulated to create a false narrative or misrepresent Kanhaiya Kumar's views.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original image, without the map in the background, can be seen in a news story published by The Hindu. This indicates that the map was added later and is not an accurate representation of the original photo.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a misleading Facebook post and a doctored image. This raises questions about the credibility and accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays any aspect."}
