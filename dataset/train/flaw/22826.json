{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by using a picture of a mansion to imply that Rep. Nancy Pelosi lives surrounded by a high perimeter wall with gun-toting security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides a misleading picture and does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the picture of a mansion represents Rep. Nancy Pelosi's actual residence, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the picture used is not Pelosi's house but an exclusive property that Forbes called San Francisco's most expensive home.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the picture used in the claim is not related to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's residence, but rather a different property altogether."}
