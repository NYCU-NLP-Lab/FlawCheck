{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of people with preexisting conditions by stating that there are \"100 million people\" with such conditions. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced estimate, indicating that the range is between 61 million and 133 million Americans.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the number of people with preexisting conditions by not considering the higher end of the estimated range. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim does not capture everyone with a preexisting condition.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of providing specific data or evidence to back up the statement that \"100 million people have preexisting conditions.\" The expert's verdict highlights the various sources and estimates consulted to determine the range of people with preexisting conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or proposals for protecting people with preexisting conditions. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump has not offered an alternative proposal to protect people with medical issues.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 100 million people with preexisting conditions would lose coverage protections if the Affordable Care Act were declared unconstitutional. The expert's verdict mentions that the ACA guarantees coverage for those with preexisting conditions, but it does not address the potential impact of its repeal on coverage protections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Trump's statement that \"There aren't a hundred million people with preexisting conditions.\" The expert's verdict presents the estimates from various sources, indicating that the claim is closer to the truth than Trump's statement."}
