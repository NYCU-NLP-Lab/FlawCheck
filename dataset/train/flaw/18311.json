{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Democrats filibustering the legislation, suggesting that it would have resulted in the shooter being in federal prison instead of committing the crime.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the legislation would have prevented the shooting, as experts have stated that it would not have made a crucial difference in this specific case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legislation proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz would have effectively prevented the shooting, without considering other factors such as the failure of the Air Force to enter the shooter's felony into the background check database.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to mention that other amendments on the 2013 gun control bill also faced hurdles and did not pass, suggesting that the Democrats were not solely responsible for the failure of the legislation."}
