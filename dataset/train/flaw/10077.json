{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money taken away from schools and the amount given as tax breaks to the rich. The actual figures are lower than what is stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support the connection between the school cuts and the tax breaks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding cuts to schools directly funded the tax breaks, without providing clear evidence or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funding cuts and tax breaks, such as the possibility of using \"tools\" in the budget to offset the cuts in state aid to schools."}
