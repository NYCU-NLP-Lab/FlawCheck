{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE, without providing further context or details about the transfer.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is based on a fiscal year 2018 document from the Department of Homeland Security, it does not provide additional evidence or sources to support the specific amount and purpose of the transfer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transfer of funds from FEMA to ICE was inappropriate or unjustified, without considering the administration's argument that appropriations limitations prevented the money from being used for hurricane response.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The administration contends that the transfer was not using disaster relief funding for immigration purposes, but rather reallocating funds within the Department of Homeland Security for specific purposes related to detention beds and deportation flights."}
