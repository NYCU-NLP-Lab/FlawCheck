{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the speaker is the only candidate who has rolled out any policies so far, when in fact, the opponent has introduced policies as well.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the statement that the opponent has not introduced any policies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the opponent has not introduced any policies based on the lack of information or details provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the opponent's campaign has stated that they have put forward proposals, but they may not have been presented in the same way as the speaker's policies."}
