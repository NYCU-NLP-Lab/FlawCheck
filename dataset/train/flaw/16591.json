{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the emphasis placed by PM Modi on sport in India and football in particular.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that PM Modi's emphasis on sport has led to the Indian team performing much better and the younger generations showing more interest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of a Brazilian child skillfully juggling a ball is evidence of the younger generation's interest in football in India.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the improvement in Indian football's ranking could be due to various other factors, not solely because of PM Modi's emphasis on the sport.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the child in the video is Brazilian, not from India, which undermines the argument that the video supports the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its argument by using a video of a Brazilian child to illustrate the improvement in Indian football, which can be seen as misleading."}
