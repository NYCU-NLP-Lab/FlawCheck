{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the percentage of Americans who donate to political campaigns. The expert's verdict states that the actual percentage varies, with estimates ranging from 8% to 12%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that only 5% of Americans donate to candidates. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure is based on one poll that is several months old and offers only a snapshot of people's self-reported donations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of Americans who donate to political campaigns is small, without providing substantial evidence for this assumption. The expert's verdict provides varying estimates and highlights the need for further data analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the percentage of Americans who donate to candidates. The expert's verdict mentions that the Pew Research Center data includes contributions of any size and does not specify the type of candidate (federal, state, or local).", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Pew Research Center data shows about 12% of Americans said they gave to candidates in 2016, which is higher than the 5% mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on one poll that is several months old, which may not accurately reflect the current percentage of Americans who donate to candidates. The expert's verdict highlights the limitations of relying on a single survey.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
