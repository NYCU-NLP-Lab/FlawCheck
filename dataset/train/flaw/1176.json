{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it includes cases that originated during President George W. Bush's term, not just during President Obama's term.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific examples or details of the 13 cases where the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the president's executive orders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that all of the president's liberal picks on the Supreme Court have consistently voted against the president's executive orders.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the Supreme Court's unanimous decisions may not necessarily mean they are striking down the president's executive orders, but rather ruling on other aspects of the cases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only one of the 13 cases directly dealt with President Obama's overreach, while the others originated during President Bush's term.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the cases and the specific issues addressed by the Supreme Court in relation to the president's executive orders."}
