{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that \"Virginia papers called Rigell's campaign 'Mostly False,'\" implying that multiple papers made this claim. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that it was only PolitiFact Virginia that rated a single claim by Rigell as \"Mostly False.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any specific details or evidence regarding which Virginia papers made the \"Mostly False\" claim about Rigell's campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"Mostly False\" rating given to a single claim made by Rigell in the 2010 election represents the overall veracity of his entire campaign. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that PolitiFact Virginia did not pass judgment on the overall veracity of Rigell or his campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the \"Mostly False\" rating given to Rigell's claim. The expert's verdict explains that Nye actually had one of the most independent records in Congress, and Pelosi rarely voted during that time, which may have influenced the rating.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that PolitiFact Virginia did not label Rigell's campaign as \"Mostly False.\" It only rated a single claim made by Rigell as \"Mostly False.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim may be considered to falter at times because it implies that Rigell's campaign was consistently labeled as \"Mostly False\" by Virginia papers, when in reality, only one claim was given that rating."}
