{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism, when in fact the FDA has not made such an announcement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading viral story on Facebook and a website that has been flagged for potentially fabricating information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that parents who abstain from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears were right all along, despite scientific evidence debunking the vaccine-autism link.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the reported adverse events related to vaccines may not necessarily be caused by the vaccines themselves but may be coincidental or have other underlying factors."}
