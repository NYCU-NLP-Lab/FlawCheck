It relies solely on the video's title and the accompanying misleading post on Facebook.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, which is that it is a simulation video posted on YouTube by the MPC Flight Recreations channel. The video's title clearly indicates that it is a simulation, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is a simulation video. The expert's investigation and reverse image search confirm that the video is not of the real Air India Express crash but a simulation video.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by presenting it as the real Air India Express crash. This exaggeration creates a false sense of urgency and sensationalism.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or facts related to the video or the crash.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information and context about the video. It fails to acknowledge that the video is a simulation and misrepresents it as the real crash."}
