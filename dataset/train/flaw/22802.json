{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Al Sharpton's role in declaring the facts about Michael Brown's use of deadly force or posing a deadly threat to the officer. This is because the claim presents it as a definite statement made by Sharpton, while the evidence provided suggests that there are varying accounts and ongoing investigations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to back up the assertion that Al Sharpton made the specific statement about Michael Brown. The evidence provided only mentions criticism of Sharpton's speeches and his role as an advocate for Brown's family, but does not directly address the claim itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Al Sharpton made a definitive statement about Michael Brown's use of deadly force or posing a deadly threat to the officer. However, the evidence provided does not directly quote Sharpton making this statement, and instead focuses on criticism of his involvement in the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding Al Sharpton's statements or actions in relation to Michael Brown's case. It presents a singular viewpoint that suggests Sharpton is making definitive statements without acknowledging any other possible interpretations or motivations."}
