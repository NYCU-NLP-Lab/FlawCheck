{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Mexico is paying for the wall through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is contradicted by experts who state that there is nothing in the USMCA that specifies Mexico will pay for the wall.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of support for the argument that Mexico is indirectly paying for the wall through the USMCA. Economists and experts argue that there are not enough new benefits in the trade agreement to cover the cost of the wall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as economists and experts argue that the benefits from the USMCA are insufficient to cover the cost of the wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim relies on the problematic assumption that the revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes Mexico paying for the wall, which experts argue is not a plausible assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts provide an alternative explanation, stating that the USMCA is very similar to NAFTA and does not bring substantial economic shifts that would save money to offset the cost of a border wall."}
