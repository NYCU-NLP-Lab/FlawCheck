{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"two-thirds of the money\" in the tax vouchers went to people \"making more than $100,000.\" This assumption is problematic because it confuses the tax voucher program with the voucher program, which has income limits for eligibility.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"two-thirds of the money\" in the tax vouchers went to people \"making more than $100,000.\" Without specific data or sources, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the $100,000 claim is in reference to a tax break for people who themselves pay to send their children to private schools, not the voucher program. This contradiction highlights the confusion and misrepresentation in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, which is that the claimant mixed up the long-standing voucher program in Wisconsin with a relatively new private school tax break. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim is based on a misunderstanding or confusion of the different programs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by mixing up the voucher program with the tax voucher program and making incorrect assertions about the distribution of money in the tax vouchers. This inconsistency and confusion weaken the credibility of the claim."}
