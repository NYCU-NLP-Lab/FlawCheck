{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the video shows member states of the OIC agreeing to file a legal challenge against Myanmar's governing party. The video actually shows an announcement about financial grants to OIC member states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video that does not provide evidence of member states agreeing to file a legal challenge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the OIC's financial grants to member states are related to a legal challenge against Myanmar's governing party, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the video is unrelated to a legal challenge and instead shows the announcement of financial grants to OIC member states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is actually about financial grants and not a legal challenge.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting the content of the video and making false assumptions.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
