{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the budget that was managed at the Department of Education. The claim states that the budget was \"more than $60 million,\" but the evidence provided suggests that the budget was actually $72.4 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify the accuracy of the budget amount. The evidence provided includes conflicting information and incomplete responses from the Department of Education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that managing a $60 million budget at the Department of Education qualifies as sufficient experience for the role of governor. This assumption may be problematic as the budget for the state of Rhode Island is significantly larger ($8.5 billion) and requires a different level of expertise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the discrepancy in the budget amount. The evidence suggests that the budget managed by Clay Pell was $72.4 million, not just over $60 million as claimed. It is unclear why the claim states a lower amount.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the budget managed by Clay Pell. The evidence provided shows conflicting information and incomplete responses, indicating that the claim may not be entirely accurate or reliable."}
