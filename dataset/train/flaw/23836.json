{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of untaxed corporate earnings sitting offshore, stating that it is anywhere from $4 trillion to $5 trillion or even more. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas and the last estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation was $2.6 trillion for 2015.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas and the information from the Joint Committee on Taxation is only available to members of Congress.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in untaxed corporate earnings is solely due to the highest tax rate in the world. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump inaccurately blames the high tax rate for the large sum of money in offshore accounts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the increase in untaxed corporate earnings, such as companies reinvesting the earnings overseas or taking on deferred liabilities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no law requiring the reporting of untaxed earnings and the last estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation was $2.6 trillion for 2015.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times."}
