{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the gender pay gap in Wisconsin by stating that women are paid \"81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job.\" The expert's verdict reveals that the claim is based on a misinterpretation of a report, which actually measures the average earnings of all women and men in the workforce, not specifically for the same job.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender pay gap is solely due to discrimination, without considering other factors such as occupational segregation, which the expert's verdict mentions as a reason for the pay disparity.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict highlights that the evidence provided by the Falk campaign to support the claim is based on a misinterpretation of a report. This suggests that the claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that occupational segregation is one of the reasons for the gender pay gap in Wisconsin. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the pay disparity, which the claim fails to acknowledge.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting the report and using it to support an inaccurate statement about the gender pay gap. This indicates a flaw in the claim's reasoning and accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the gender pay gap in Wisconsin is not solely based on women being paid \"81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job.\" The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is false and provides evidence to contradict it."}
