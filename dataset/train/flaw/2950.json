{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Wasserman Schultz's missed votes by stating that it is \"one of the worst records of any member of Congress.\" The expert's verdict shows that she actually ranked 45th among the top missers of votes in the House, which suggests that there were many members who missed more votes than her.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that Wasserman Schultz's missed votes is one of the worst records. The expert's verdict provides data from the New York Times analysis, which shows that she missed 62 votes, but it does not compare this to other members or provide a context for determining if it is truly one of the worst records.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that missing votes is a significant measure of a member of Congress's performance or dedication to their constituents. However, the expert's verdict points out that there are various reasons why members may miss votes, such as illness or family issues, and that it may not necessarily reflect their commitment to their responsibilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were other members who missed more votes than Wasserman Schultz, including those who had personal or health issues. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for her missed votes, such as legitimate reasons or competing responsibilities.", "Falters at times": "The claim suggests that Wasserman Schultz's record of missed votes is consistently bad, but the expert's verdict shows that she ranked 45th among the top missers of votes in the House. This suggests that her record may not be consistently bad, but rather falls within the range of other members' missed votes."}
