{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which faculty salaries at UW System institutions have fallen below the national average. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure of 18 percent may be used repeatedly during the state budget season, indicating a possible exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that faculty salaries at UW System institutions have fallen more than 18 percent below the national average. The expert's verdict mentions using salary figures collected by the American Association of University Professors, but it does not directly address the specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gap between UW employees' compensation and their peers has widened in recent years and continues to grow. This assumption is not directly supported by evidence or data in the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in faculty salaries at UW System institutions compared to the national average. The expert's verdict mentions that the comparison of salaries has limitations and does not clarify whether the \"peers\" include competing private schools or just public schools.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim is understating any information or facts."}
