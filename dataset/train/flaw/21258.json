{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that a defunded police department in Montana was forced to sell their nuclear submarine. This is not a factual recounting of real-life events.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a satirical article from The Hard Times, which is a punk news site known for its humorous and satirical nature. The article itself is not a reliable source of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a defunded police department in Montana actually owned a nuclear submarine, which is highly unlikely and unrealistic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation or evidence to support the existence of a defunded police department in Montana selling a nuclear submarine."}
