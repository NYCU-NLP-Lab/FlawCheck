{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of both candidates' proposals on job creation and loss in Wisconsin. The claim states that Clinton would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin, and Trump would cost the state 61,050 jobs. The numbers are presented as precise counts, which could be seen as an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is based on analyses by Moody's Analytics and the work of economist Mark Zandi, the claim lacks additional supporting evidence or data to back up the specific numbers provided. It relies heavily on the extrapolation of national job gains and losses to Wisconsin, which may be seen as lacking enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the impact of Clinton's and Trump's policies on job creation and loss would be evenly distributed among states, including Wisconsin. However, it is stated that Wisconsin's job growth has lagged behind the nation's for years, suggesting that the assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for job gains or losses in Wisconsin, such as other economic factors or policies that may influence job growth in the state. It solely attributes the projected job impacts to the proposals of Clinton and Trump, which may overlook alternative explanations."}
