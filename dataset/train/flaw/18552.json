{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the level of support for the tax increases by stating that they were approved by the people, when in reality, the voters approved a bond issue that would be supported by the taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval of the bond issue reflects support for the taxes, when it could also be argued that the voters had nothing to lose as their gas tax was going up regardless of their vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the tax increases were court-ordered, as no evidence or explanation is provided for this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the tax increases, such as the need to improve the state's highways, which was supported by an overwhelming majority of legislators."}
