{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of the sequester on parents' ability to find child care for their kids by stating that \"tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble\" without providing sufficient evidence or support for this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the assertion that \"tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids\" if Congress doesn't avoid the sequester. It is unclear how this conclusion was reached and what data or research supports it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sequester will directly and significantly impact child care options for parents without providing enough evidence or explanation for this assumption. It does not consider alternative factors or explanations that could influence child care availability.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for how parents might find child care for their kids if the sequester takes effect. It presents a one-sided perspective without acknowledging potential solutions or alternatives that could mitigate the impact on parents.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of the sequester on child care subsidies and programs by not fully exploring the potential consequences and challenges that could arise if funding is reduced. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and consistent analysis of the potential impact of the sequester on child care options for parents. It relies on vague language and lacks specific details or examples to support its conclusion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from The New York Times, which reported that \"day care centers are almost certainly not going to be padlocked on March 1.\" This suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the actual situation and may contradict factual information."}
