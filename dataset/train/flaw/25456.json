{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pelosi was not detained at an undisclosed location due to evidence viewed by Trump at Cheyenne Mountain military base. She was instead at the Capitol and in the House Chamber during the specified time.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Pelosi was detained and that Trump had viewed evidence on a stolen laptop, when in reality, there is no evidence to support these claims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegations made about Pelosi's detention and Trump's involvement with a stolen laptop.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a connection between Pelosi's alleged detention and the stolen laptop, without providing any credible evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation, stating that the claim originated from false social media posts and conspiracy theories spread on platforms like Parler."}
