{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the bias in favor of Muslims in the UPSC exam by suggesting an organized 'infiltration' in the Indian bureaucracy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the UPSC exam is biased in favor of Muslims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a greater number of Muslim aspirants taking the UPSC exam indicates bias, without considering other factors such as population demographics or individual merit.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the percentage of Muslim qualifiers in the UPSC exam has varied between 3% to 5% over the past five years, which does not indicate a sudden rise or bias.", "Understate": "The claim understates the representation of Muslim candidates in the UPSC exam by highlighting only one Muslim candidate in the top 100, while ignoring the overall percentage of Muslim qualifiers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the variation in Muslim qualifiers, such as changes in recruitment numbers or individual performance.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by conveniently skipping data from 2018, which would have shown a decrease in Muslim qualifiers compared to the previous year."}
