{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Andrew Cuomo was at a birthday party in the Hamptons without a mask on. The only sources for this claim are unsourced social media posts on platforms like Facebook and Parler.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs and video circulating on social media are recent and depict a current event. However, the expert's investigation suggests that the pictures and video were not taken recently and do not show a recent event.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation suggests that the pictures and video circulating on social media were taken in 2019 and do not depict a recent event. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Gov. Cuomo attended a maskless birthday party in the Hamptons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gov. Cuomo did not host a party in the Hamptons for his birthday in the year the claim was made. The governor held a virtual birthday party due to social-distancing restrictions in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences or implications of Gov. Cuomo attending a maskless birthday party, as it suggests hypocrisy on his part regarding social-distancing guidelines.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on unsourced social media posts as the only source of information, rather than credible news reports or official statements.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
