{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue by stating that \"40,000 primary age children were taught in classes of 36 or more in England in 2016.\" This number, although significant, may be seen as an exaggeration when considering the total number of primary school pupils in England.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the issue by focusing only on the specific number of children taught in classes of 36 or more. The expert's verdict highlights that \"hundreds of thousands of children are in overcrowded classrooms\" and that this has been a long-standing issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific supporting evidence or data beyond the statement itself. It does not provide additional context or sources to back up the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the issue of overcrowded classrooms, such as increasing pressures on school places and fluctuations in class sizes over the years. This suggests that there may be alternative factors contributing to the situation beyond what is mentioned in the claim."}
