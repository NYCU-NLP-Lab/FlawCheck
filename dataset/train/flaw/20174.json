{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the actions of the former North Carolina elections board chairman by stating that they \"tried to drag a cancer-stricken woman out of her hospital bed.\" The evidence suggests that the chairman simply relayed a request for a delay in the hearing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the complaint was \"bogus\" and that the board had not fully investigated it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the former chairman's actions were motivated by wrongful influence, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the former chairman did not try to drag the woman out of her hospital bed, as evidenced by the correspondence between the parties involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions of the former chairman, such as following state law requirements to resolve matters expeditiously."}
