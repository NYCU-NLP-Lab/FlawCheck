{"Understate": "The claim understates the salary increases of Austin residents who don't work for city government by stating that their salaries have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years, when in fact there have been raises ranging from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent for city employees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that salaries have not been increasing by 3 percent a year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that salaries of Austin residents who don't work for city government should be increasing at the same rate as city employees, which may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lack of 3 percent salary increases for Austin residents who don't work for city government, such as different industries or job sectors experiencing different wage growth rates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that city employees have received raises ranging from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in recent years, which suggests that some salaries have indeed been increasing by that amount.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the lack of salary increases for Austin residents who don't work for city government by stating that salaries have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years without providing sufficient evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on anecdotal evidence from Austin City Council Member Don Zimmerman and his chief of staff, rather than comprehensive and reliable data sources."}
