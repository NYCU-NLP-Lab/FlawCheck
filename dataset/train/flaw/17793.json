{"Understates": "The claim exaggerates the ability of 5-year-olds to \"take hormones and change my sex.\" The expert's verdict states that professional medical organizations recommend against puberty blockers for children who have not reached puberty, which typically begins between ages 10 and 12. Hormone treatment for feminization or masculinization of the body is typically not considered until patients are at least 16 years old, and gender reassignment surgery is typically only available to those 18 and older in the United States.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that 5-year-olds can take hormones and change their sex. The expert's verdict provides information about the recommended age for medical interventions and the guidelines for transgender patients, which suggest that such interventions are not appropriate for young children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that 5-year-olds have the capacity and understanding to make decisions about hormone treatment and changing their sex. The expert's verdict emphasizes the importance of counseling, psychological evaluation, and a team of medical professionals in assessing the suitability of physical interventions for transgender individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the statement made in the Facebook post. The expert's verdict highlights the proliferation of misinformation about medical treatments for transgender patients and the social media backlash following recent events related to transgender rights."}
