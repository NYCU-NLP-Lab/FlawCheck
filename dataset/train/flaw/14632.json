{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that female genital mutilation is not an Islamic problem, which may be a problematic assumption as it overlooks the fact that the practice is prevalent in many Muslim-majority countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that female genital mutilation is solely a central African problem and not an Islamic problem.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that female genital mutilation is prevalent in both central African countries and certain Muslim-majority countries, suggesting that it may be an issue within both contexts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that female genital mutilation is practiced in a number of Muslim-majority countries, as acknowledged by international organizations such as the World Health Organization and UNICEF.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which female genital mutilation is solely a central African problem, as it fails to acknowledge the significant prevalence of the practice in certain Muslim-majority countries.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the issue, failing to consider the complex factors and multiple regions where female genital mutilation is practiced."}
