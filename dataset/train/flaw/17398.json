{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it presents Prince Alwaleed bin Talal as expressing anti-American sentiment, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that he considers himself a \"great friend\" of America and has made investments in Western entities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's ownership of Fox News is related to his statement about a strong American government not being good for him, but the expert's verdict provides information about his ownership stake being in the previous incarnation of News Corp. and not directly in Fox News.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's ownership of Fox News is linked to his statement about a strong American government not being good for him.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's ownership of Fox News is related to his statement about a strong American government not being good for him, as the expert's verdict provides information about his investments in various Western entities and his previous ownership stake in the broader News Corp. conglomerate."}
