{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gap, Inc. stores will feature signs saying \"Merry Christmas\" instead of \"happy holidays.\" The evidence provided is based on a 2013 story and a 2016 article from Your Nation News, both of which lack credibility and official sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged policy change by Gap, Inc. is a response to \"political correctness\" and aims to \"ditch political correctness.\" However, there is no concrete evidence or official statement from Gap, Inc. to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gap, Inc. has not been recognized by the conservative American Family Association (AFA) for \"not recognizing\" Christmas. This suggests that the claim of Gap, Inc. changing their signage to \"Merry Christmas\" is not accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the alleged policy change by Gap, Inc. by presenting it as a major shift in their branding and inclusivity. The evidence provided does not establish the extent or impact of the supposed change.", "Understate": "There is no evidence suggesting that the claim understates any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable evidence. The sources cited lack credibility and official confirmation from Gap, Inc.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is based on misinformation, rumors, or misinterpretation of the 2013 story and the 2016 article."}
