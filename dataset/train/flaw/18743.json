{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of Georgians who did not have a chance to finish college. The expert questions the statistic and suggests that more than 28% of Georgians may have finished college.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not finishing college is a disadvantage or something negative. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the fact that there are many successful individuals who did not complete college.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statistic of 72% of Georgians not finishing college. The expert questions the accuracy of this statistic.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim presents Perdue's remarks about Handel not graduating from college as evidence of him thinking he is better than 72% of Georgians. However, there could be alternative explanations for his comments, such as highlighting his own qualifications or emphasizing the importance of real-world experience."}
