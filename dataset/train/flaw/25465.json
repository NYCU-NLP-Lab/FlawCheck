{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which taxes are going down for every taxpayer, as there are exceptions for wealthy individuals in high-tax states.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential impact of the new tax laws on wealthy individuals in Manhattan and San Francisco, suggesting that only some of them may see their taxes go up.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that only rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco will see their taxes go up, as there are other high-tax states and cities where wealthy individuals may be affected.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only people whose taxes are going up are the really rich, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that the tax increases for wealthy individuals in high-tax states are primarily due to the limitation on state and local tax deductions, which can apply to taxpayers across the country and not just in Manhattan and San Francisco."}
