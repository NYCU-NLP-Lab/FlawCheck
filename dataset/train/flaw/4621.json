{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of holistic doctors who have died under suspicious circumstances, suggesting that there are dozens, when in reality there is no evidence of a conspiracy to wipe out holistic doctors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Justine Damond's death is connected to her occupation as a holistic healer, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between holistic doctors fighting \"Big Pharma\" and their suspicious deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the deaths of holistic doctors are unrelated to each other and are not part of a conspiracy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Justine Damond's death, such as the pattern of civilians being extrajudicially killed while interacting with police officers."}
