{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Texas created 40 percent of the new jobs in America since June 2009, which may be an inflated figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that Texas created 40 percent of the new jobs in America.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the job growth in Texas is solely due to Perry's policies, without considering other factors such as natural advantages or population growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the job growth in Texas, such as natural advantages like oil, ports, and proximity to Mexico, as well as factors like being a right-to-work state and having low debt."}
