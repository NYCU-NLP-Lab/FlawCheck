This may be an exaggeration as the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voter identification laws are complicated and expensive without providing enough support or evidence to back up this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that voter identification laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the purpose and impact of voter identification laws. It presents one side of the argument without acknowledging opposing viewpoints."}
