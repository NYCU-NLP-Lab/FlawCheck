{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who have come off of food stamps and have been lifted off of welfare. The reductions in federal assistance programs do not add up to 10 million.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of reductions in SNAP participation. The data is flawed and the real number is likely lower due to reporting problems and discrepancies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and complete data to support the statement. The data is incomplete and flawed, and there are issues with reporting and discrepancies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. The data is flawed and there are discrepancies in reporting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by using the imprecise term \"welfare\" without specifying which federal assistance programs are included in the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reductions in SNAP participation, such as the trend of participation falling since before Trump took office due to a growing economy."}
