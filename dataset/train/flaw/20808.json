{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies on the World Bank's definition of extreme poverty, which has been criticized for its methodological issues and neglect of regional inequality.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is based on the World Bank's estimate, which is not the only measure of poverty and may be considered low-balled by many other definitions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that extreme poverty has been halved over the last 30 years, but this assumption is based on a specific definition and may not fully capture the reality of poverty reduction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the reduction in extreme poverty, such as regional inequality and different measures of poverty, which may impact the accuracy of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that according to the United Nations report based on the 2008 definition, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell by 58% in 21 years, which is more than what the claim suggests.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of extreme poverty reduction by relying on a specific definition and not considering alternative measures or factors such as regional inequality.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the extent of poverty reduction."}
