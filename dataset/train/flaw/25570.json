{"Understate": "The claim \"It's actually the safest time to fly\" understates the risks associated with flying during the COVID-19 pandemic. The expert's verdict provides evidence from official guidance and experts advising against nonessential travel, particularly for older adults and those with chronic health conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove its assertion that it is the safest time to fly. The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to the person who made the claim for evidence but did not receive a response. Additionally, official guidance contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that empty airports and reduced flights indicate safety. However, the expert's verdict points out that the decrease in air travel is due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the associated risks, rather than indicating safety.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that official guidance from organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) advises against nonessential travel, especially for vulnerable populations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the decrease in air travel, such as travel restrictions and concerns about the spread of the virus. The expert's verdict mentions that some experts doubt the effectiveness of travel restrictions in slowing the spread of the virus."}
