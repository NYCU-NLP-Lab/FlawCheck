{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Temple of Baal is being rebuilt in New York and London as an operable house of worship, with more such temples to follow. The expert's verdict clarifies that only replicas of the arch from Syria's Temple of Baal were planned for London and New York City's World Heritage Week in April 2016.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the Temple of Baal is being rebuilt as a house of worship.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the replicas of the arch from the Temple of Baal are intended as operable houses of worship, which is not supported by the expert's verdict. The verdict only mentions that the structures will be full, permanent, and operational, without specifying their purpose as houses of worship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the construction of the replicas, such as cultural preservation or historical significance. The expert's verdict mentions that the replicas were intended as a gesture of defiance and cultural treasure, without suggesting any alternative motives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Temple of Baal was destroyed by ISIS in August 2015. The expert's verdict confirms the destruction of the temple and the construction of replicas of the arch.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it presents a consistent assertion. The expert's verdict provides additional information and context but does not indicate any inconsistencies or faltering."}
