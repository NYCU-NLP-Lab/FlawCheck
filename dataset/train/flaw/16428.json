{"Contradict fact": "The claim suggests that President Obama ordered flags flown at half-staff for Whitney Houston but did not mention the deaths of Chris Kyle or Nancy Reagan. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that the President has the authority to issue proclamations for flags to be flown at half-staff on various occasions, including the deaths of prominent individuals such as Pope John Paul II, Neil Armstrong, and victims of mass shootings.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of President Obama ordering flags flown at half-staff for Whitney Houston by comparing it to the omission of mentioning the deaths of Chris Kyle or Nancy Reagan. The expert's verdict clarifies that flag-lowering honors are not limited to political figures and can be issued for various reasons, including significant events or tragedies.", "Understate": "The claim understates the criteria for ordering flags flown at half-staff by implying that only the deaths of Chris Kyle or Nancy Reagan deserved such recognition. The expert's verdict explains that flag-lowering honors are not solely reserved for members of the armed forces or political figures but can be issued for a range of significant events or individuals.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times since there is no specific evidence provided to support this bias.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that President Obama did not mention the deaths of Chris Kyle or Nancy Reagan. The expert's verdict provides information on the occasions when flags are flown at half-staff but does not specifically address whether the President mentioned these individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flag-lowering honors for Whitney Houston were unjustified compared to the deaths of Chris Kyle or Nancy Reagan. This assumption is problematic as it overlooks the various factors and criteria that influence the decision to lower flags at half-staff.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for why President Obama ordered flags flown at half-staff for Whitney Houston but did not mention the deaths of Chris Kyle or Nancy Reagan. Therefore, this bias is not applicable in this case."}
