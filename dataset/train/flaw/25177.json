{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the existence of super PACs supporting other candidates by stating that \"Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC.\" However, there are other candidates without affiliated super PACs as well.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by failing to acknowledge the existence of unaffiliated super PACs supporting Bernie Sanders, such as Collective Actions PAC and Billionaires for Bernie.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that Sanders is the only candidate without a super PAC. The provided evidence shows that both Sanders and Donald Trump are major candidates without affiliated super PACs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a super PAC is a negative aspect of a campaign, without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that candidates without affiliated super PACs may have unaffiliated super PACs supporting them, as is the case with Sanders and Trump."}
