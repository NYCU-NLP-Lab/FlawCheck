{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as there is no evidence of Nike releasing a statement urging consumers to donate clothing to veterans rather than burning it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a significant number of disgruntled consumers who were burning their Nike clothing in protest against Colin Kaepernick and the sportswear company, but there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the mention of people \"burning\" their Nike apparel, such as the hoax pictures that spread online or the satirical fabrications designed to elicit anger against Kaepernick.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the statement attributed to Nike regarding the angry outcry and urging consumers to donate clothing to veterans was a fabrication and not originated by Nike.", "Understate": "The claim understates the homeless veteran population by stating that veterans comprise \"nearly a fifth of all homeless people,\" which does not match up with federal data that estimates the homeless veteran population to be around 40,000, far less than 20 percent of the overall homeless population.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Colin Kaepernick's inclusion in the Nike campaign by mentioning spurious reports of Nike losing contracts with the University of Alabama and the federal government, as well as Michael Jordan pulling his signature Air Jordan brand from the company."}
