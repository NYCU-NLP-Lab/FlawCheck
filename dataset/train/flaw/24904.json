{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of LGBT votes that Democrats receive in federal elections. The expert's verdict provides evidence that suggests a high percentage of LGBT voters lean Democratic, but it does not provide a specific percentage or comprehensive data on all federal elections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to fully validate the statement that Democrats receive over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections. The expert's verdict provides some evidence from exit polls and articles, but it does not present a comprehensive analysis or data from multiple elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why LGBT voters may lean Democratic. The expert's verdict provides a statement from the chairman of the Libertarian Party, suggesting that Democrats abuse LGBT voters, but it does not explore other potential reasons for their voting preferences.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and concise argument. The expert's verdict includes multiple statements and sources, but it does not present a cohesive analysis or conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high percentage of LGBT votes for Democrats indicates a lack of action or progress on LGBT issues. The expert's verdict does not provide enough information to fully evaluate this assumption, as it focuses more on the voting patterns rather than the actions or policies of Democrats.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting facts in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
