{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that there is limited information available to fully understand how and why the pornographic videos were uploaded to Facebook and why they appeared in search results. This suggests a lack of sufficient evidence to support a clear explanation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that typing a single letter or the word \"video\" in the Facebook search bar returned pornographic videos. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the appearance of pornographic results could be due to a flood of adult content uploaded to Facebook at around the same time, rather than a specific feature of the search tab. This challenges the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the influx of adult material in search results could be explained by a large-scale Facebook outage and a subsequent flood of videos uploaded to the platform. This alternative explanation questions the claim's assertion that typing a single letter or the word \"video\" directly led to the appearance of pornographic videos.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that typing a single letter or the word \"video\" in the Facebook search bar returned pornographic videos. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the screenshots posted on social media appear to be genuine, but the exact cause and mechanism behind the appearance of pornographic results are unknown. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the search bar directly resulted in pornographic videos.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any biases according to the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not exaggerate any biases according to the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim falters by presenting two versions of the claim - one suggesting that typing the word \"video\" returned porn and the other asserting that typing any letter filled the results with porn. This inconsistency in the claim's presentation weakens its reliability."}
