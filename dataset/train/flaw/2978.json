{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Obama's plan by stating that he wants to \"ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns\" without providing enough evidence to support this extreme statement.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that the NRA mailer does not provide enough details or evidence to support their claim about Obama's plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's answer on a questionnaire from 1996 reflects his current stance on gun control, without considering the possibility that his views may have evolved over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the questionnaire may have been filled out by a campaign aide and that Obama's views may have been mischaracterized, providing an alternative explanation for his answer on the questionnaire."}
