{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Mister Ed was a horse is not supported by any evidence or explanation in the expert's verdict. It is just mentioned that the producers chose not to explain why Mister Ed was a zebra instead of a horse.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viewers couldn't tell the difference between a horse and a zebra because the show was filmed in black and white. This assumption may not be accurate as viewers might still be able to distinguish between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for why a zebra was used instead of a horse, which contradicts the claim that Mister Ed was a horse.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mister Ed was actually portrayed by a trained Grevy's zebra named Amelia.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fame of Mister Ed by referring to him as \"the talking equine of television fame.\" While the show had a following, it may not have been as famous as implied.", "Understate": "The claim understates the challenges faced during the production of the show, such as the difficulties in training the original horse cast as Mister Ed and the tight budget."}
