{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that Dollar General added exactly 2,500 stores and 20,000 jobs during David Perdue's four-year tenure as CEO. The annual reports show an increase of nearly 2,100 stores and 16,000 workers, which is slightly lower than the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify its accuracy. While the annual reports show an increase in stores and employees during Perdue's tenure, they do not exactly match the dates of his tenure, and there may be other factors that contributed to the company's growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth of Dollar General during Perdue's tenure can be solely attributed to his leadership as CEO. It does not consider other factors such as market conditions, industry trends, or the contributions of other executives and employees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Dollar General's growth during Perdue's tenure, such as the company's ambitious plans to open new stores and exceed projections. The claim does not provide enough evidence to rule out these alternative explanations."}
