{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that customs agents boarded a Greyhound bus and asked passengers for proof of citizenship. The only evidence provided is the activist's video, which caused confusion about the authenticity of the encounter.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video footage posted by the activist accurately represents an actual encounter of customs agents asking Greyhound passengers for proof of citizenship. However, the authenticity of the encounter is called into question due to the confusion surrounding the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of customs and border protection officers on the Greyhound bus. It is mentioned that Greyhound had informed passengers about a routine security check, not an immigration-related action. This suggests that the officers may have been conducting a security check rather than specifically targeting passengers for proof of citizenship."}
