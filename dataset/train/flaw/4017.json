{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of physical barriers on illegal traffic by stating that it has dropped by at least 90% in four specific sectors. The data provided does not support this level of reduction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that physical barriers are solely responsible for the reported decrease in illegal traffic. Other factors may have contributed to the decline.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the expansion of physical barriers is the primary cause of the reported decrease in illegal traffic. It does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may have influenced the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that there are other sectors with expanded physical barriers that also experienced an increase in border apprehensions. This suggests that factors other than physical barriers may be influencing illegal traffic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the overall trend of declining apprehensions along the southern border, regardless of the presence of physical barriers. The claim's assertion that physical barriers are solely responsible for the decrease in illegal traffic is not supported by the data provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing clear and specific information about the years being compared and the timeframe of the reported decrease in illegal traffic. This lack of clarity weakens the claim's credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
