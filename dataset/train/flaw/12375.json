{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Congressman Duffy's record of voting against VA backlog fixes. The expert mentions that there were other votes in which Duffy voted for veterans' services.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Congressman Duffy has a long record of voting against VA backlog fixes. The expert mentions that many of the votes cited by the DCCC were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against certain bills or solutions automatically means voting against fixing the VA backlog. The expert mentions that the DCCC conflates the two issues, suggesting that any vote against veterans' interests is a vote against fixing the backlog.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Congressman Duffy's votes. The expert mentions that the votes often broke down along party lines, with Duffy joining his Republican colleagues."}
