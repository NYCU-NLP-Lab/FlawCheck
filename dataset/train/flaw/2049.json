{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta practice a satanic ritual known as \"spirit cooking.\" The only connection mentioned is an email exchange between Tony Podesta and Marina Abramovic, but it does not involve Hillary Clinton or John Podesta directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the \"spirit cooking\" dinner mentioned in the email exchange was an art project created by Marina Abramovic in 1996, rather than a satanic ritual. Abramovic herself clarified that her home cooking events did not feature bodily fluids as described in her cookbook.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the email exchange between Tony Podesta and Marina Abramovic implies the involvement of Hillary Clinton and John Podesta in a satanic ritual. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption, as neither Clinton nor Podesta were recipients of the email or responded to it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hillary Clinton did not send or receive the emails published by WikiLeaks, and John Podesta did not respond to them. Therefore, there is no direct connection between them and the alleged \"spirit cooking\" ritual.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the email exchange and the alleged connection to a satanic ritual. The evidence provided does not support the claim, and the term \"spirit cooking\" is misrepresented as a satanic ritual when it was actually an art project.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a coherent and accurate representation of the facts surrounding the alleged \"spirit cooking\" ritual. It fails to acknowledge the context of the email exchange and misrepresents the nature of \"spirit cooking.\""}
