{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the extent to which Facebook could have taken action to prevent the U.S. Capitol riot. The expert's verdict mentions that Facebook's enforcement efforts were not comprehensive and that there were still numerous groups promoting violent rhetoric on the platform even after the riot.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the events were largely organized on platforms other than Facebook. The expert's verdict mentions that the events were organized to a large degree on social media, but does not specifically attribute it to platforms other than Facebook.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that platforms other than Facebook do not have the abilities to stop hate, standards, and transparency, which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support or refute this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Facebook's role in the U.S. Capitol riot. The expert's verdict mentions that Facebook's enforcement efforts were not comprehensive and that there were still groups promoting violent rhetoric on the platform, suggesting that Facebook could have done more to prevent the attack."}
