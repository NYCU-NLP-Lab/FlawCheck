{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the candidate's ballot access by stating that he will be on the ballot in all 50 states, when in fact there are legal challenges in some states and the final number is uncertain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that no other third-party candidate will come close to achieving the same level of ballot access.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the candidate's statement about being on the ballot in all 50 states may be influenced by his desire to be included in the nationally televised presidential debates."}
