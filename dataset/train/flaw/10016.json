{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of union membership on median weekly income by stating that it is roughly $200 more without including benefits. It is possible that the difference in income may vary depending on various factors such as occupation or education level.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the potential impact of union membership on median weekly income by not considering the potential benefits that come with being a union member, such as better job security and retirement benefits.", "Lack enough support": "Although the claim is supported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, it may be argued that more comprehensive research and analysis are needed to fully support the claim and determine the extent of the impact of union membership on income.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in median weekly income between union and nonunion members, such as differences in occupation or industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that union membership is the sole factor contributing to the $200 difference in median weekly income, without considering other potential factors that may influence income levels.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not acknowledging that the impact of union membership on income can vary depending on the specific occupation or industry."}
