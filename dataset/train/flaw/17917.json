{"Falters at times": "The claim falters by stating that police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs, when in fact police deaths exceeded 200 in 1970, a year before Nixon's declaration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that police deaths decreased sharply after Prohibition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in police deaths after Prohibition is directly linked to the end of Prohibition itself, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in police deaths after Prohibition, such as changes in law enforcement tactics or improvements in officer safety measures."}
