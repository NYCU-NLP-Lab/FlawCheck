{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that 77 percent of people in federal prison for possession of illegal substances are not citizens of the United States, which may not accurately represent the true percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 77 percent of federal prisoners convicted of possessing illegal drugs are non-U.S. citizens.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high percentage of non-U.S. citizens in federal prison for drug possession is a result of President Obama's \"illegal, unconstitutional amnesties,\" without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of non-U.S. citizens in federal prison for drug possession, such as differences in law enforcement practices or demographic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that nearly 80 percent of the federal system's total inmates are U.S. citizens, as reported by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that state prisons also hold many inmates with drug convictions, which may impact the overall percentage of non-U.S. citizens in prison for drug possession.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the issue of drug offenses in federal prisons by focusing solely on possession and not considering other drug-related crimes."}
