{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential effects of the supermoon by stating that it will trigger tidal waves and catastrophic earthquakes, wreaking havoc across the planet. The expert's verdict clarifies that the connection between supermoons and earthquakes is not well-established.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence to support the assertion that the supermoon will cause tidal waves and catastrophic earthquakes. The expert's verdict explains that the correlation between lunar cycles and seismic activity is a long-standing debate in seismology, and the research on this topic is limited to specific regions or circumstances.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the supermoon and the occurrence of tidal waves and catastrophic earthquakes. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the connection between the two is not explicitly supported by scientific research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the claim by discussing the correlation between seismic activity and lunar cycles. It suggests that the gravitational influence of the moon may trigger earthquakes along Earth's most fragile faults, but this correlation is not universally applicable and is limited to specific regions or circumstances.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the supermoon on November 14, 2016, was the largest one since 1948 and would not be surpassed until 2032. The expert's verdict confirms this fact as reported by NASA.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
