{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the delay in passing aid for Superstorm Sandy by stating that \"nothing has passed\" after nearly two months, implying a complete lack of progress.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and challenges involved in passing emergency relief aid, as it does not take into account the differences in circumstances and political dynamics between Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the comparison between the timing of aid passed for Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. While it mentions the passage of two bills amounting to $60 billion after Hurricane Katrina, it does not provide sufficient context or evidence for the delay in passing aid for Superstorm Sandy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the delay in passing aid for Superstorm Sandy is solely due to inaction or negligence, without considering other factors such as differing levels of damage, political considerations, or procedural hurdles.", "Exist alternative explanations": "There may be alternative explanations for the delay in passing aid for Superstorm Sandy, such as disagreements over funding allocation, debates on the scope of assistance, or concerns about accountability and oversight. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
