{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs gained in Texas during Abbott's tenure as governor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that more Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of the state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in population automatically translates to more people having jobs, without considering other factors such as economic conditions or job availability.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The economists suggest that the steady job growth in Texas is a result of the state's status quo and population growth, rather than specific actions taken by Governor Abbott."}
