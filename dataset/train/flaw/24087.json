{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of times Russ Feingold voted to raise taxes by stating it as \"over 250 times\" without providing enough evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Russ Feingold voted over 250 times to raise taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that votes on non-binding budget resolutions are equivalent to votes on legislation that directly raises taxes, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the votes cited, such as votes against tax cuts, which contradict the claim that Feingold voted to raise taxes."}
