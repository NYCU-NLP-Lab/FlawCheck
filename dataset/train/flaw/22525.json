{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of coal proposed to be mined by stating it as \"10 billion tons\" when the actual estimate is \"10.2 billion tons.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no proposal to mine the stated amount of coal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that mining 10.2 billion tons of coal would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would save, without considering other factors or alternatives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the claim is based on a distorted interpretation of a single line in a report, rather than an actual proposal to mine the stated amount of coal."}
