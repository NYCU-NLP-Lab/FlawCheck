{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of students killed in U.S. schools since 2012 by stating it as 7,182, which is significantly higher than the actual count of 64.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the stated number of students killed in U.S. schools since 2012.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number mentioned in the meme refers specifically to students killed in school shootings, whereas it actually includes all firearm fatalities involving children, including suicides and shootings off campus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The meme's inflated number of 7,182 is likely a misrepresentation of the 7,000 pairs of shoes laid out in front of the U.S. Capitol to demonstrate the number of children killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook shooting."}
