{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by using the word \"busted\" to imply that Mike Pence was caught and proven guilty of stealing campaign funds. In reality, the Federal Election Commission could not agree on whether he violated campaign finance laws.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the incident occurred nearly three decades ago and is not a recent event. It also fails to mention that the issue was brought up by a partisan website with a liberal slant.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the accusation that Mike Pence stole campaign funds to pay his mortgage. The Federal Election Commission did not find him guilty of violating campaign finance laws.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that using campaign funds for personal expenses automatically equates to stealing. However, the general counsel's office cited earlier FEC opinions that allowed for campaigns to pay for candidates' living expenses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to mention the alternative explanation that the candidates, including Pence, used campaign funds for personal expenses within the allowed discretion of campaign finance laws."}
