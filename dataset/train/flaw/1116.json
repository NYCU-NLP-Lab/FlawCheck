{"Understates": "The claim may understate the positions of Cal Cunningham and Erica Smith by suggesting they support sanctuary policies, when in fact they have not explicitly endorsed such policies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that opposing a bill requiring sheriffs to detain people on behalf of ICE is equivalent to supporting sanctuary policies, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Cunningham and Smith's opposition to House Bill 370, which the claim does not consider.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that North Carolina has banned sanctuary cities, making it unlikely for Cunningham and Smith to explicitly support such policies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear definition of \"sanctuary policies\" and using the term loosely.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the positions of Cunningham and Smith by implying they fully support sanctuary policies, when they have expressed a belief in local government flexibility."}
