{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine causes degenerative disease. The photos provided are unrelated to the vaccine and have circulated online before the pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and the degenerative disease based on the misleading report. However, the report is from a non-credible source and lacks scientific evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos used as evidence in the misleading report are unrelated to the vaccine. The photos have been published in previous studies and news reports, not related to vaccines.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential side effect of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine by referring to it as \"Monsterism\" and stating that it ravages victims with physical and mental deformities. There is no credible evidence to support such extreme claims.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its credibility by relying on a non-credible source (Real Raw News) and misleading information. The use of unrelated photos and the lack of scientific support weaken the claim's validity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the facial deformities shown in the photos is that they are unrelated to the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. The photos have been published in previous studies and news reports with different explanations for the individuals' conditions.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
