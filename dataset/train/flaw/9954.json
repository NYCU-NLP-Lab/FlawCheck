{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of the cuts made by Scott Walker to public education. The expert's verdict mentions that Walker made cuts to school funding in 2011, but it does not provide a clear indication of the exact amount or whether it matches the $1.6 billion mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the progress made by Scott Walker in restoring funding to public education. The expert's verdict mentions that Walker has been adding back funding, but it does not provide a clear indication of the total amount or whether it matches the $630 million mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to substantiate the specific figures mentioned. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a report by the Forward Institute, but it clarifies that the report does not state that Walker made a $1.6 billion cut in education funding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cuts made by Scott Walker to public education are inherently negative. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Walker touted an increase in state aid to schools, indicating that there may be alternative perspectives on the impact of his actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 2009-\u201911 state budget, approved by a Democratic governor and Democratic-run Legislature, also contributed to the reduction in property tax levies. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not fully consider the context and factors influencing education funding."}
