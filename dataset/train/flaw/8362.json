{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the claim that 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks. The only evidence provided is a national telephone poll conducted by Quinnipiac University, which may not be representative of all gun owners.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for universal background checks among registered voters translates to support among gun owners, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high level of support for universal background checks, such as respondents' beliefs in common-sense safety measures or concerns about the gun-show loophole and internet purchases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of gun owners' opinions on universal background checks. It focuses on one poll and does not consider other factors or conflicting data.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the level of support for universal background checks among gun owners if the evidence provided is accurate.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear whether the claim contradicts any factual information as the evidence provided is limited."}
