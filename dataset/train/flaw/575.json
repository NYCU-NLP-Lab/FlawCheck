{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the growth rate of women-owned businesses in Texas compared to the nation. While the growth rate in Texas is higher than the national average, it is not nearly double as stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the specific growth rate mentioned. The information provided in the email blast does not provide a comprehensive analysis or sources for the growth rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the time period for which the growth rates are attributed to President Obama. The claim attributes the growth rates to President Obama's entire time in office, while the data provided only covers the period from 2007 to 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth rates of women-owned businesses in Texas are directly attributable to President Obama's policies or actions. It does not consider other factors or variables that may have influenced the growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the growth rates, such as state-specific policies, economic factors, or demographic changes that may have contributed to the higher growth rate in Texas compared to the nation."}
