{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration since it describes the firearm used by the Orlando shooter as a \"weapon of war.\" While the firearm in question, the Sig Sauer MCX, is a civilian version of a gun designed for military use, it is not typically classified as a \"weapon of war.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to definitively classify the firearm as a \"weapon of war.\" While the firearm's design may have been influenced by military requirements, it is not explicitly stated that it is considered a \"weapon of war\" by the military.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the classification of the firearm as a \"weapon of war\" is universally accepted and understood. However, there may be differing opinions on the classification of firearms and what constitutes a \"weapon of war.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why the Orlando shooter chose to use the Sig Sauer MCX rifle, such as personal preference or availability, rather than solely attributing it to the firearm being a \"weapon of war.\""}
