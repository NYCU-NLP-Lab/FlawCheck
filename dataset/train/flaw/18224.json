{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the video shows a crackdown on protests in Myanmar after the coup in 2021. The provided evidence suggests that the video is from 2007, not from 2021.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is recent and related to the 2021 coup in Myanmar. However, the evidence suggests that the video is from 2007 and not directly linked to the current situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from 2007 by presenting it as evidence of the 2021 crackdown. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as it being shared out of context or intentionally misleading. The evidence suggests that the video is not related to the 2021 events in Myanmar.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of the video being from 2007 and not providing accurate information about the current situation in Myanmar. This undermines the claim's credibility and accuracy.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the video and the 2021 coup in Myanmar. It presents the video as evidence of the crackdown, even though it is from a different time period.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not thoroughly verifying the source and context of the video before making the assertion that it shows the crackdown on protests in Myanmar after the 2021 coup. This lack of thoroughness weakens the claim's credibility."}
