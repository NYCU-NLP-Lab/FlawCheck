{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Western Australia has not passed any vaccine legislation in response to COVID-19 and does not have a COVID-19 vaccine program in place.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the new law forces vaccination at school and includes the removal of underwear, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or official documentation provided to support the existence of the new law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the highlighted portions of the Public Health Act 2016 indicate that vaccination can be forced upon children at school and their underwear may be removed, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is based on misinformation or misunderstanding of the existing legislation and public health measures in Western Australia."}
