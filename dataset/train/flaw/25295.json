{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the violations of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act by Texas lawmakers. The expert's verdict suggests that every Texas House map as initially drawn by lawmakers has been found in violation of Section 5, but the claim only states that redistricting has \"always\" been found in violation without specifying the scope.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that redistricting by Texas lawmakers has always been found in violation of Section 5. The expert's verdict mentions instances of the Justice Department objecting to redistricting plans, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or evidence for every redistricting since 1975.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the violations of Section 5 by Texas lawmakers are solely responsible for the requirement of federal approval before changing election practices. It does not consider other potential factors or alternative explanations for the application of Section 5 to Texas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the violations of Section 5, such as changes in demographics or political motivations, which could also contribute to the repeated violations found by the Justice Department.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were some redistricting actions between 1975 and 1980, which were not taken into account in the claim's assertion that redistricting has always been found in violation of Section 5.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the violations by using the term \"always\" without providing comprehensive evidence or analysis for every redistricting since 1975.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the violations of Section 5 by Texas lawmakers. It does not provide a detailed examination of each redistricting case or the specific reasons for the violations found."}
