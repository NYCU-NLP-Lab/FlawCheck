{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence provided by the claim or the expert to support the assertion that the main reason 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants became illegal was due to changing jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict includes statements from Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, who states that job change is not the primary reason for visa overstays. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for why unauthorized immigrants become illegal.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Paul is not fully supported by the evidence provided. While there is some support for the 40 percent statistic, there is also conflicting information and a lack of evidence to support the claim that changing jobs is the main reason for becoming illegal.", "Understate": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claim underestimates any aspect related to the topic.", "Exaggerate": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claim exaggerates any aspect related to the topic.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not mention any contradictions with factual information in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that changing jobs is the main reason for unauthorized immigrants becoming illegal, but this assumption is not supported by evidence or expert opinions provided in the verdict."}
