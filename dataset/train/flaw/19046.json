{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Georgia's ranking as the \"second highest\" in fraudulent tax refund claims. The expert's verdict mentions that Georgia ranked third in per-capita tax-related identity theft in both 2012 and 2014, which contradicts the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Georgia has the country's second-highest number of fraudulent tax refund claims. The expert's verdict mentions that the statement was based on data from the Federal Trade Commission, but it does not provide specific data or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Georgia's ranking in overall identity theft complaints translates directly to fraudulent tax refund claims. The expert's verdict highlights that the data used to support the claim includes all types of identity theft complaints and does not specifically address tax-related identity theft.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may have alternative explanations or factors to consider. For example, it mentions that identity thieves have increasingly focused on income tax fraud in recent years, indicating that the prevalence of fraudulent tax refund claims may not be solely attributed to Georgia's situation."}
