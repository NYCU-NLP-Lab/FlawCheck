{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Dr. Manmohan Singh has been declared the strongest Prime Minister in the world, without providing sufficient evidence or sources to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only relies on an article from a website called Viral in India, which is owned and managed by an individual who claims to be a 'News/Media personality' and an 'RTI activist'. There is no mention of any credible sources or expert opinions to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that receiving the 'Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers' award from Japan automatically makes Dr. Manmohan Singh the strongest Prime Minister in the world, without providing any logical reasoning or evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Dr. Manmohan Singh received the 'Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers' award in 2014, not at present as claimed by the articles. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information from unreliable sources and not providing enough evidence or support to back up the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation presented in the claim."}
