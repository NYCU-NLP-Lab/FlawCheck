{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Emma Breier was used as a \"crisis actor\" for President Trump's hospital visit lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the assumption that the patient shown with the Trumps in the photograph is the same age as Emma Breier and that they bear a passing resemblance to each other, without any concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the patient shown in the photograph is not Emma Breier, but an adult survivor of the shooting, as confirmed by a representative from the hospital.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that all survivors treated at the hospital were adults, according to the hospital representative.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph and implies a deliberate staging of the visit using \"crisis actors\" without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any biases that understate or downplay the significance of the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of biases that make the claim falter at times."}
