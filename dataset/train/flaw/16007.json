{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the shift in terminology from \"global warming\" to \"extreme weather\" as if it is a deliberate attempt to avoid the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific evidence by suggesting that climate change is not happening or is not a significant issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific backing to support the assertion that the change in terminology is solely due to the failure of \"global warming\" as a term.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in terminology is solely driven by political or PR reasons, without considering other factors such as scientific consensus or evolving understanding of climate dynamics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the shift in terminology from \"global warming\" to \"climate change\" was made to better encompass the range of climate-related phenomena beyond just temperature increase."}
