{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the lion was killed by a hunter in Kogi state, Nigeria. The only evidence provided is a Facebook post and a Twitter image, both of which do not directly confirm the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the lion may not have been killed in Kogi state, Nigeria, as the image was also shared on social media claiming it came from Guinea.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Twitter user who posted the image did not reply to AFP's inquiry, which raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that lions are only known to exist in two specific areas in Nigeria, Kainji Lake National Park and Yankari Game Reserve. This raises doubts about the claim that a lion was killed in Kogi state.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the event by referring to the hunter as \"great\" and implying that it is a notable occurrence. Without further evidence, it is difficult to determine the true significance of the event."}
