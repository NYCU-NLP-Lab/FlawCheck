{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Donald Jr. and Eric Trump sold access to their father, as it is unclear if the event actually took place and if any access was actually sold.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump sold access to their father. The information provided is based on draft invitations and reports from gossip websites, which may not be reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Trump sons founded a non-profit organization specifically to funnel money and sell access to their father. However, this assumption is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of Donald Jr. and Eric Trump's names in the draft invitation and as temporary hosts of the event. It is possible that their involvement was not related to selling access but rather to their association with their father's presidency."}
