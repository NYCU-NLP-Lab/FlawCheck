{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference between President Trump's and the previous administration's support for Ukraine by stating that the previous administration only provided blankets for defense against invading Russians, while President Trump approved the supply of weapons. The expert's verdict clarifies that the previous administration provided significant nonlethal military and security aid to Ukraine, including training, equipment, and radar systems.", "Understate": "The claim understates the aid provided by the previous administration by characterizing it as only blankets. The expert's verdict explains that the Obama administration provided hundreds of millions of dollars worth of nonlethal military and security aid to Ukraine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that President Trump approved the supply of weapons to Ukraine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that providing blankets as defense against invading Russians is inadequate, without considering the broader context of the aid provided by the previous administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided view by solely focusing on President Trump's approval of weapons supply to Ukraine, without considering any alternative explanations or factors that may have influenced the decision-making process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the previous administration provided significant nonlethal military and security aid to Ukraine, rather than just blankets.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the complex issue of U.S. support for Ukraine and not providing a comprehensive analysis of the actions taken by both administrations."}
