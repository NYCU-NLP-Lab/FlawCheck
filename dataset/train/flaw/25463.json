{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the job growth difference between states that raised the minimum wage and those that didn't was a small difference of just two-tenths of one percent. This suggests that there may not be enough substantial evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job growth in states that raised the minimum wage is directly caused by the wage increase. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore any alternative explanations for the observed job growth difference between states that raised the minimum wage and those that didn't. It is possible that other factors could have influenced the job growth, but this is not considered in the analysis.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the second method of analysis, which gives more weight to high-population states, resulted in a very small difference in job growth between wage-raising and non-wage-raising states. This suggests that the analysis may not be consistent or reliable in determining the true impact of raising the minimum wage on job growth.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any potential understatements in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any potential exaggerations in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not mention any contradictions to factual information in the claim."}
