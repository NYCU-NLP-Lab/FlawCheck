{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the bailout program was \"nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the trade aid program and the coronavirus program have provided assistance to farmers in general, not just large agricultural companies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bailout program was solely intended to benefit large agricultural companies, without considering the impact on smaller farms. The expert's verdict mentions that the trade aid program drew criticism for favoring large farms, but it does not provide enough information about the coronavirus program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the bailout program was only a handout for large agricultural companies. The expert's verdict mentions that the payouts from the programs have not been fully analyzed or broken down, making it difficult to determine the exact distribution of funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the bailout program. The expert's verdict mentions that the government provides various programs and aid to farmers, not just the two recent bailout programs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a broad statement without providing specific evidence or examples to support it. The expert's verdict provides some information about the trade aid program and the coronavirus program, but it does not fully address the claim's assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the bailout program on large agricultural companies. The expert's verdict mentions that the trade aid program skewed towards large farms, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of funds in the coronavirus program."}
