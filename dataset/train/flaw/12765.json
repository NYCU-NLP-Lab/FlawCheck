{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photos by suggesting that they show a close consultation between the Thai student leader and the US ambassador, implying foreign intervention in the protests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photos indicate close consultation or preparation for violence in the protests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the meeting between the Thai student leader and the US ambassador in 2016 is relevant to the 2020 anti-government protests, without providing a clear connection or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photos, such as a routine meeting or a discussion on a different topic unrelated to the protests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the former US ambassador to Thailand, Glyn T. Davies, left his post in September 2018, two years before the 2020 protests.", "Understate": "The claim understates the timeline of the photos, as they were published in 2016, more than four years prior to the 2020 protests, suggesting that they are not directly related to the current situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear connection between the photos and the alleged foreign intervention or violence in the protests."}
