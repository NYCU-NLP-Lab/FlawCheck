{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump \"failed\" to place his hand over his heart during George H.W. Bush's funeral, implying that he intentionally did not show respect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides screenshots and comments from social media users, which may not be reliable sources of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that placing one's hand over the heart is a mandatory gesture of respect, when in fact it is a voluntary sign of respect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that President Trump did have his hand over his heart at certain moments during the funeral, but dropped his hands to his sides after the casket passed him by. This alternative explanation challenges the initial claim."}
