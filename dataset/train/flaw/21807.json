The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was based on a CBS News story, but it does not provide any additional sources or evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of debt accumulated by Obama is solely his responsibility and does not take into account other factors such as the struggling national economy and tax cuts. The expert's verdict explains that the debt increase under Obama is due to various factors beyond his control.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the increase in debt under Obama, mentioning factors such as the struggling national economy and tax cuts.

The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this fact and contradicts the claim made in the statement.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear whether the claim falters at times as the provided information does not mention any inconsistencies or inconsistencies in the claim. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if this bias exists in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the amount of debt accumulated by Obama.
