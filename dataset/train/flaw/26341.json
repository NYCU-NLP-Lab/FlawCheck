{"Understate": "The expert's verdict states that the flowers in the photograph are not proven to have mutated due to radiation from the power plant. This suggests that the claim may be understating the evidence or proof for the mutation being caused by radiation.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the appearance seen in the photograph may simply be the result of fasciation, not nuclear radiation. This suggests that the claim may falter by not considering alternative explanations for the mutated daisies.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that daisies showcasing similar mutations have been found at locations far away from nuclear radiation. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support to solely attribute the mutations to radiation from the Fukushima power plant.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that many viewers assumed that the mutations displayed in the photograph were caused by nuclear radiation from the power plant. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption made by viewers without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the mutations seen in the photograph may be the result of fasciation, a rare condition affecting plants, rather than nuclear radiation. This suggests that there may exist alternative explanations for the mutated daisies."}
