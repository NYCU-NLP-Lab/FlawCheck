It fails to acknowledge the increase in pages, credits, loopholes, and deductions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the statement that the tax code hasn't been updated. The expert provides evidence of the tax code's growth and changes since 1986.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that updating the tax code means a complete overhaul, disregarding the incremental changes and additions that have occurred over the years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that while there hasn't been a major overhaul, there have been numerous changes and additions to the tax code since 1986."}
