{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of killing coyotes by stating that for every one killed, the population will usually multiply.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that killing coyotes will lead to population growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that killing coyotes will result in population replacement and multiplication without providing a clear explanation or evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may influence coyote population dynamics, such as habitat availability, food sources, or natural predators."}
