{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of illegal immigrants who are overstaying visas. While the claim states that 40% of illegal immigrants are overstaying visas, the most commonly accepted estimate is 45% according to the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the specific percentage of 40% for illegal immigrants overstaying visas. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure is the most commonly accepted estimate, but it is based on older reports and studies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the immigration system is broken because almost half of all illegal immigrants came into the country through legal channels. However, this assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account other factors contributing to illegal immigration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that immigration trends have changed over the years, with more immigrants overstaying their visas than crossing the border illegally. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's focus on border security and highlights the importance of addressing visa overstays.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the most commonly accepted estimate for the percentage of illegal immigrants who are overstaying visas is 45%, not 40% as stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a specific percentage without acknowledging the range of estimates provided by different reports and studies. The expert's verdict mentions estimates ranging from 33% to 50% in the Pew report and 27% to 57% in the General Accounting Office report."}
