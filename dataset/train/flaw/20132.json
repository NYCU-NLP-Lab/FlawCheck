{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that two-thirds of the groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative. The report and the Washington Post story cited by Progress Texas do not provide information about the political affiliations of the other 202 groups targeted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the groups targeted for scrutiny were solely based on their political views, specifically conservative groups. However, the IRS stated that the groups without \"tea party\" in their names included organizations of all political views. This suggests that the targeting may not have been solely focused on conservative groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why certain groups were targeted for scrutiny by the IRS. The expert's verdict mentions that IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants' political views and activities, including some broad descriptions but also others aimed at conservatives. This suggests that the targeting criteria were not solely focused on conservative groups."}
