{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the October 2017 California wildfires were started by Mexican drug cartels without providing sufficient evidence or attributing the statement to any credible source.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks concrete evidence or specific details to support the assertion that Mexican drug cartels were responsible for starting the wildfires.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the investigation into the cause of the wildfires was still ongoing at the time, and no official determination had been made.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the wildfires by describing them as \"unprecedented in size and destruction\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on anonymous sources and conspiracy theories rather than verifiable facts or official statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cause of the wildfires, such as windblown power lines, which have been implicated in at least some of the fires according to investigators.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
