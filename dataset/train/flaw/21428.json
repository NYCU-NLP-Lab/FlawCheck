{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the Trump Administration is seeking to monitor social media posts of disability recipients. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the Social Security Administration is studying strategies to use social media in evaluating disability applications, but it does not provide a clear indication of the extent or implementation of this monitoring.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples of the Trump Administration actively monitoring social media posts of disability recipients. The expert's verdict mentions that the Social Security Administration is studying strategies and considering the use of social media, but it does not provide concrete evidence of active monitoring.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that monitoring social media posts of disability recipients is solely the initiative of the Trump Administration. The expert's verdict mentions that the proposal was put forward in the fiscal year 2020 budget request of the Social Security Administration, indicating that it may not be solely driven by the Trump Administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the use of social media in evaluating disability claims. The expert's verdict mentions that the Social Security Administration is studying strategies from other agencies and private entities, suggesting that there may be alternative reasons or precedents for the use of social media in this context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts, as the expert's verdict confirms that the Social Security Administration has proposed using social media posts in making disability determinations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the extent of the Trump Administration's actions, as it accurately reflects the proposal put forward by the Social Security Administration.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not indicate any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim."}
