{"Falters at times": "The expert's verdict suggests that Biden's past comments on Social Security have been criticized by some liberals who believe any cuts to the program are non-negotiable. This implies that Biden's stance on Social Security has been inconsistent or uncertain.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the video clip circulated by the Sanders campaign, which suggests Biden's support for Paul Ryan's tax plan, was misleading. This implies that there may not be enough evidence to fully support the claim that Biden has a history of saying \"we should cut Social Security.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sanders views raising the age of eligibility as a cut to Social Security, while Biden may not see it that way. This suggests that there is a difference in interpretation and assumption about what constitutes a cut to the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that Biden's current proposal for Social Security includes increasing revenue and expanding benefits, which contradicts the claim that he has a history of saying \"we should cut Social Security.\" This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Biden's past comments or actions regarding the program."}
