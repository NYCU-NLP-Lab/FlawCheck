{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the CDC's readjustment of the COVID-19 death toll from 60,000 down to 37,000. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is not true and that the comparison was made between two separate data sources that report different measurements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the CDC readjusted the death toll.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC readjusted the COVID-19 death toll without considering other factors or explanations. The expert's verdict explains that the data on the CDC's page are provisional and continually revised, and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in reported death tolls, such as the use of different data sources or criteria for counting deaths. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the comparison was made between different measurements from separate data sources."}
