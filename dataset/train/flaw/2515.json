However, this claim is not factual and is an exaggeration created by a Christian satire website.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no actual deal or agreement between Pastor Steven Furtick and Lakewood Church to form a \"superstar preaching team.\" It is a fictional story created by a satire website.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a satirical article from the Babylon Bee, which is known for publishing humorous and fictional content. There is no factual evidence or credible sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the information from the satire article is true and presents it as a fact. However, it fails to recognize the satirical nature of the source and the lack of credibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is entirely false and based on a satirical article. The satire website, Babylon Bee, clearly states that it is a source for Christian news satire, and the claim fails to acknowledge this."}
