{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of H.R. 1 by stating that \"millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote,\" which is contradicted by the expert's verdict that federal law already requires citizenship to vote and H.R. 1 would not change that policy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that H.R. 1 does not change federal law, which states that only eligible citizens can vote in federal elections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific details to back up the assertion that H.R. 1 would result in the quick registration of millions of illegal immigrants to vote.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that H.R. 1 would open the door to more votes cast by people who live in the U.S. without permission, which is contradicted by the expert's verdict that H.R. 1 aims to expand voter registration for eligible citizens and does not change the requirement of citizenship to vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations and steps offered in H.R. 1 to ensure legal registrations by eligible citizens, as stated in the expert's verdict."}
