{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Richard Gere by stating that he gave $100 to every homeless person he saw, which is not supported by sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the statement that Richard Gere gave $100 to every homeless person he saw. The evidence provided only mentions instances where he went unnoticed while filming as a homeless man.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Richard Gere's actions while filming as a homeless man in New York City accurately reflect his real-life actions towards homeless individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Richard Gere's actions were part of his role in the movie \"Time Out of Mind\" and not necessarily a genuine act of giving money to homeless people."}
