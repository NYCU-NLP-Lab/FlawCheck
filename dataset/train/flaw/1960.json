{"Lack enough support": "The claim states that \"small trials\" have had some degree of success, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support this statement. It would be helpful to have more information about the trials and their results.", "Falters at times": "The claim acknowledges that more investigation is needed, suggesting that the success of convalescent plasma therapy may not be consistent or fully established.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the success of convalescent plasma therapy in previous cases (such as diphtheria and SARS) can be directly applied to COVID-19 without considering potential differences in the viruses or patient populations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or potential factors that could contribute to the observed success of convalescent plasma therapy in the small trials."}
