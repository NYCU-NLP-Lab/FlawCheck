{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential health problems and economic damage caused by the rule on air pollutants. The expert's verdict mentions that the facts are more nuanced than what the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the rule threatens to cause serious health problems, brain damage, death, and economic damage. The expert's verdict mentions that the facts are more nuanced and that the EPA's recommendation for a new assessment was not binding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the EPA's change in evaluating the benefits and costs of regulating air pollutants will directly lead to serious health problems, brain damage, death, and economic damage. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the link between the EPA's change and these outcomes is not straightforward.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the EPA's change as a threat to public health and the economy, but the expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and nuances to consider. The EPA concluded that the economic benefits of reducing mercury emissions do not outweigh the costs to power plants, which suggests a different perspective on the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the EPA's change in evaluating air pollutants was not binding and that it was recommended to do a new assessment. The expert's verdict highlights these contradictions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential benefits of the EPA's change in evaluating air pollutants. The expert's verdict mentions that the compliance cost to the power plant industry under the previous rule was estimated to be about $9.6 billion a year, while the financial value of air quality improvements could range from $37 billion to $90 billion.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in presenting a clear and accurate picture of the EPA's change and its potential impacts. The expert's verdict points out the nuanced nature of the facts and provides additional context to consider."}
