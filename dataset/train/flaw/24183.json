{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a $2 trillion to $3 trillion infrastructure deficit may be an exaggeration as it is based on a study from 2009 and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single study from the American Society of Civil Engineers and there may be other estimates or studies that provide different figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of money needed to modernize the infrastructure is equivalent to the infrastructure deficit, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the state of the nation's infrastructure, such as differing priorities in government spending or inefficiencies in infrastructure management."}
