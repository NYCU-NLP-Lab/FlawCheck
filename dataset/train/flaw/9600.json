{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of tar deposited in smokers' lungs by stating that marijuana cigarettes deposit four times more tar than tobacco-based cigarettes. The expert's verdict mentions that while it may be true that marijuana smoke deposits more tar into the lungs than tobacco smoke, the overall harm caused to a tobacco smoker's lungs versus a marijuana smoker's lungs is not accurately depicted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statement about the amount of tar deposited in smokers' lungs. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a somewhat misleading infographic frequently shared on social media sites.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of tar deposited in smokers' lungs is the sole determinant of harm caused to the lungs. The expert's verdict highlights that there are other factors to consider, such as the presence of cancer-causing chemicals and the link between marijuana smoking and lung cancer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the lack of increased risk of lung cancer in heavy marijuana smokers. It suggests that the differences in exposure and the potential protective effects of THC may play a role.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a recent study found no link between marijuana and an increased risk of lung cancer. The expert's verdict mentions this study and the lack of association between marijuana use and lung cancer.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately depicting the difference in overall harm caused to a tobacco smoker's lungs versus a marijuana smoker's lungs. The expert's verdict points out the limitations of the claim and the need to consider other factors."}
