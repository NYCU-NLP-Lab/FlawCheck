{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that black Americans have \"10 times less wealth than white Americans.\" The actual wealth disparity may vary and may not be exactly 10 times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks detailed support or specific data to back up the assertion that black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans. The only supporting evidence provided is a reference to a Washington Post Wonkblog story and other reports based on 2016 consumer survey data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wealth disparity between black and white Americans is solely due to systemic economic factors, such as access to good jobs and skills training. It does not consider other potential factors that may contribute to wealth disparities, such as differences in inheritance, home ownership rates, and participation in job-related savings plans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the wealth disparity between black and white Americans, such as differences in educational attainment, historical factors, or cultural factors that may influence wealth accumulation."}
