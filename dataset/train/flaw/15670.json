{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the positive state of New Jersey's economy by stating that citizens are working at the highest rate in three years without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years. It only provides raw numbers without considering other factors such as the size of the labor force.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of employed people is a sufficient measure to determine the rate at which citizens are working, which is a problematic assumption as it ignores the size of the labor force.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that the claim fails to consider the labor force and the unemployment rate, which could provide an alternative explanation for the number of employed people in New Jersey."}
