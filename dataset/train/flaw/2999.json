{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the consequences of Joe Biden not completing his term by suggesting that Nancy Pelosi would become vice president. This is not accurate according to the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or reasoning for why Nancy Pelosi would become vice president if Joe Biden cannot complete his term.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Joe Biden cannot complete his term, Kamala Harris will automatically become president and nominate a vice president. However, this assumption may not be accurate as the expert's verdict explains that the process of filling a vice-presidential vacancy is not clearly defined in the Constitution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that if the vice president becomes president, the empty vice presidential slot may not be filled, as there is no clear process for it. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation to the claim's assumption."}
