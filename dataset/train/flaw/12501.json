{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photograph shows Joe Biden with the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, when in fact it shows Biden with Robert Byrd, a former member and organizer for the KKK.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Biden was in any way associated with the Grand Wizard of the KKK.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden's association with Robert Byrd automatically implies support for the KKK, without considering Byrd's renouncement of his past views and his later actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photograph, which is that it shows Biden with Robert Byrd, a senator who later renounced his past white supremacist views."}
