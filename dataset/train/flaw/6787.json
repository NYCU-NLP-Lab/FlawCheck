{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of acidity in the oceans by stating that they have become \"30 percent more acidic.\" The expert's analysis suggests that the pH of surface seawater has only dropped from about 8.2 to about 8.1 since the mid-18th century, which is a relatively small change.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the actual increase in acidity by stating a 30 percent rise, while some sources suggest the increase is actually closer to 26 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that the oceans have become 30 percent more acidic. The expert's analysis mentions measurements dating back to 1989, but it is unclear if these measurements are comprehensive enough to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in carbon dioxide absorption by the oceans is the sole cause of the observed increase in acidity. However, the expert's analysis does not explore alternative factors or explanations that could contribute to the change in ocean acidity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis raises the question of how pH levels were measured in the 1800s or earlier, suggesting that alternative explanations or uncertainties exist regarding historical ocean acidity levels."}
