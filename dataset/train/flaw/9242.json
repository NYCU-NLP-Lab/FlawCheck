{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people moving to Texas by stating that 1,000 people are moving to Texas every day, which may not be entirely accurate according to the expert's analysis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the statement that there will be 15 million more people in Texas over the next 25 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in population will result in a significant increase in the number of cars and a lack of driving space, which may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim fails to acknowledge that people also leave the state of Texas, which could affect the overall population growth."}
