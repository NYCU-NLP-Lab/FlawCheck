{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the governors have \"issued orders banning the prescription of hydroxychloroquine to patients with COVID-19.\" While there are restrictions and limitations on access to the drug, none of the actions comprise an outright ban.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actions taken by New York and Nevada, as they have restricted access to chloroquine prescriptions to avoid stockpiling of the drug. However, there are exemptions for clinical trials and patients hospitalized with COVID-19.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the governors have issued such orders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the restrictions and limitations on access to chloroquine are equivalent to a ban on the drug, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as the actions taken by the governors can be seen as precautionary measures to prevent stockpiling and ensure the availability of the drug for those who need it the most.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Michigan has not taken any regulatory action related to chloroquine. Instead, it has asked prescribers to not give the drug to potential stockpilers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the actions taken by the governors and misinterpreting their intentions."}
