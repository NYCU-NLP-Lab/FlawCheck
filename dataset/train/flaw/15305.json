{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Glenn Beck that he has never endorsed any candidate is contradicted by evidence that he did endorse Adam Andrzejewski for governor of Illinois in 2010.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to reach Beck for elaboration on his claim, and their search of the Nexis news database did not find any previous endorsements by Beck. This suggests a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Adam Andrzejewski, who clarifies that Beck's endorsement of his campaign was actually a misunderstanding and that Beck did not endorse him but instead shared audio of an endorsement by Lech Walesa. This alternative explanation undermines Beck's claim of never endorsing any candidate."}
