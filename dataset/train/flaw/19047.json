{"Understate": "The claim may understate Kathie Tovo's true stance on public safety spending by selectively quoting her response to a questionnaire and not taking into account her other statements supporting public safety.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Kathie Tovo believes Austin invests too much in public safety, as her other statements indicate support for police, firefighters, and paramedics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tovo's criticism of escalating public-safety contracts translates to believing the city invests too much in public safety, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Tovo's criticism of public safety spending, such as addressing the growing gap in the city's general fund between public safety contracts and other expenditures, which the claim does not consider."}
