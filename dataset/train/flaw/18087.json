{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the prevalence of obesity in Kenya. Experts estimate that only one in 10 adults and far fewer children are actually obese, which is significantly lower than the claim of two in every five Kenyans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence. The source of the figures, the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, only provides data on the nutritional status of women and children, not men. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the figure of two in every five Kenyans being obese is accurate, despite experts stating that no other available data supports this claim. It is problematic to make such an assumption without more comprehensive and recent data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the role of obesity in hospitalizations and deaths from diseases like COVID-19. While the claim suggests that obesity is a significant factor, it does not consider other potential factors that may contribute to these outcomes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the prevalence of obesity in Kenya. The closest figure in the available data is 10.1% of women aged 15 to 49 being obese, which is significantly lower than the claim of two in every five Kenyans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the available data and expert opinions. The claim suggests that two in every five Kenyans are obese, while experts estimate a much lower prevalence of obesity in the country.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate and reliable information. It relies on a single survey from 2014, which may not reflect the current situation accurately. Additionally, the claim does not provide a clear source for the figure of two in every five Kenyans being obese."}
