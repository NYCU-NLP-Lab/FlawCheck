{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the amount of contributions received by Hillary Clinton from Wall Street and hedge funds. While the claim states that she received $100 million, the expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual amount is significantly lower, with contributions to Clinton's campaign and pro-Clinton super PACs totaling $51.4 million and $64.3 million respectively.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds. The expert's verdict provides data on the actual contributions received, which contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds are going directly to Hillary Clinton's campaign. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the contributions come from individual employees or members of the organizations, or political action committees tied to the organizations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the majority of Wall Street contributions benefiting Clinton come from a small group of ultra-wealthy, liberal donors who work in finance. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the contributions, such as personal political beliefs or individual interests, rather than a direct endorsement from Wall Street as a whole."}
