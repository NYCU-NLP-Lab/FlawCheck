{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of manufacturing factories lost on other trade deals. The expert's analysis shows that the number of manufacturing establishments did decline, but the claim's statement of \"over 50,000\" factories lost may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's analysis points out that they did not receive any response from Schultz to provide more details on the statement. This lack of additional information may indicate a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loss of manufacturing factories is solely attributed to trade deals. The expert's analysis mentions the impact of the Great Recession, indicating that other factors may have contributed to the decline in manufacturing establishments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis mentions that the number of manufacturing establishments actually rose in the first three years after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decline in establishments beyond trade deals.", "Falters at times": "The expert's analysis states that Schultz's figures hold up if the impact of the Great Recession is included. This suggests that the claim may falter in accurately attributing the decline in manufacturing establishments solely to trade deals, as other factors like the recession played a role.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of trade deals on the loss of manufacturing factories. While the exact number may be subject to debate, the expert's analysis does show a decline in the number of establishments, indicating some impact from trade deals."}
