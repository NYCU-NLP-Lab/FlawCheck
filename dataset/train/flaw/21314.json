{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement about health care premiums.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the slower growth in health care premiums is directly connected to the reforms in the Obamacare law, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the slower growth in health care premiums, such as other factors unrelated to Obamacare."}
