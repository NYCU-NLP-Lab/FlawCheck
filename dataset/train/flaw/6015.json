{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no concrete evidence provided to prove that an unknown third party whispered the word \"dozens\" to Hillary Clinton during the third presidential debate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the audio captured in a video during the debate came from Clinton's earpiece and definitively features a mysterious person saying the word \"dozens.\" However, the noise is indecipherable and could have been a sound made by Clinton herself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the noise captured in the video could have been a sound made by Clinton with her lips, as her mouth moves at the same time the noise can be heard. This provides an alternative explanation to the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert states that none of the variations of the claim about Clinton being fed lines via a secret earpiece during the debates has proved true. This contradicts the claim that an unknown third party whispered to Clinton during the debate.", "Understate": "The expert may be understating the possibility of the claim being true by stating that it is a rumor that has been repeatedly debunked."}
