{"Cherry": "picking: Former President Bill Clinton selectively chose to use private-sector job figures instead of total job figures, which paints a more favorable picture of President Obama's record on job creation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that job creation is solely attributed to President Obama's policies, ignoring other factors such as the Federal Reserve, bank lending, and global business trends.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there are alternative explanations for job creation, including factors beyond the control of any one person, such as economic policies and global trends.", "Contradict fact": "The expert points out that if the count starts from the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector job growth is well below the 4.5 million figure stated in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the job growth by starting the count at the most favorable point possible for President Obama, rather than considering other starting points.", "Understate": "The claim understates the job growth by only focusing on private-sector jobs and not considering the overall job market, which includes government jobs.", "Falters at times": "The expert criticizes the claim for faltering in its methodology and approach to measuring job growth, suggesting that it may not be the best way to evaluate the economy's performance."}
