{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the advocacy on the reduction of contracted employees in Parks, as there are alternative explanations for the decrease.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to definitively attribute the reduction in contracted employees solely to the advocacy of Commissioner Fritz.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by Parks and Recreation and the city's Human Resources director suggests that the reduction in contracted hires may be attributed to a rule change and the types of programs and activities run by the parks, rather than solely to Commissioner Fritz's advocacy."}
