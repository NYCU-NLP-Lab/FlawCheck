{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific sources or data to back up the statement that \"criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and New York.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all \"criminal aliens\" are noncitizens, which is a problematic assumption. The term \"criminal aliens\" can apply to both legal and illegal immigrants, and not all of them are necessarily involved in criminal activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the statistics provided, such as differences in law enforcement practices or reporting methods among the five states.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the real figure of murders committed by criminal aliens in those five states is impossible to know. This contradicts the claim's assertion that criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual percentage of murder convictions involving criminal aliens, as the expert's verdict suggests that the figure may be higher or different due to limitations in data collection.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing accurate information, as the expert's verdict highlights discrepancies in the sources and lack of reliable data to support the claim."}
