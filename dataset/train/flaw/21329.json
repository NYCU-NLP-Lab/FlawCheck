{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of precincts in Cuyahoga County where Mitt Romney received zero votes. The expert's verdict states that Romney received no votes in a total of 18 precincts, not the claimed 12 precincts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Romney received exactly zero votes in any precincts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney receiving zero votes in certain precincts is unusual or indicates impropriety, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the distribution of votes in Ohio was not evenly split, with Obama winning in Democratic strongholds like Cuyahoga County. This alternative explanation could suggest that the lack of votes for Romney in certain precincts is due to the strong support for Obama in those areas, rather than any impropriety or anomaly."}
