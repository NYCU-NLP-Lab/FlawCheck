{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the issues with the healthcare.gov website by stating that it \"never worked\" and \"still doesn't work.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the website had a troubled launch with bugs and glitches, but does not support the claim that it never worked or still doesn't work.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that the website \"never worked\" or \"still doesn't work.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the website had a troubled launch, but does not provide specific evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $5 billion website refers to healthcare.gov, which the expert's verdict clarifies is not entirely correct. The $5 billion refers to grants given to states to establish health care exchanges, not specifically for the federal website.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning the cost of the website according to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is $834 million, significantly lower than the $5 billion mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a blanket statement that the website \"never worked\" and \"still doesn't work.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the website had a troubled launch, but does not provide enough information to determine its current functionality.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the healthcare.gov website never worked or still doesn't work. The expert's verdict mentions that the website had a troubled launch, but does not provide evidence to support the claim that it never worked or still doesn't work.", "Other biases": "There may be other biases present in the claim and expert's verdict, but they are not explicitly mentioned or evident in the given information."}
