{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a crude sketch of a phallus in the episode of Maya the Bee.

However, the expert's verdict does not provide any information or analysis regarding the intent behind the alleged drawing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that obscene images have appeared in children's movies and TV shows in the past, such as The Rescuers. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the presence of the alleged crude sketch in Maya the Bee, such as a production error or an unintentional inclusion.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not understate any biases in the claim."}
