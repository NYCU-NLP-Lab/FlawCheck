{"Contradict fact": "The claim of Muslims being buried alive by workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is contradicted by the evidence presented by local police, who stated that the video actually shows an exhumation of a murder case unrelated to the BJP or Muslim burial.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by falsely implicating the BJP workers in the alleged burial of Muslims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the accusation made against the BJP workers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between the video and the Hindu-Muslim clashes in Delhi, which is a problematic assumption as the video is unrelated to those events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the local police and media reports contradicts the claim and suggests a different context for the video."}
