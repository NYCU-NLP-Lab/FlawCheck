{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Richard Cordray's involvement in directing the Ohio commission to permit the armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds. The expert's verdict suggests that Cordray's actions were part of his role as attorney general and not an extraordinary intervention.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough supporting evidence to fully substantiate the assertion that Richard Cordray assumed personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident. The expert's verdict mentions Cordray recounting the difficulties in pulling off the rally, but it does not provide direct evidence of him assuming personal responsibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Ohio commission's decision to permit the armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds was solely directed by Richard Cordray. The expert's verdict suggests that Cordray's involvement was part of a larger process and that the decision was not solely his.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the Ohio commission permitted the armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds. The expert's verdict mentions the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board being resistant to the planned rally and changing their decision at the last minute, suggesting there may be other factors at play."}
