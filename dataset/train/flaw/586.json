{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the illegal occupation, implying that it went on for hours without any action being taken to enforce the law.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by assuming that the lack of action by Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney was intentional and due to an order to stand down.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the occupation was illegal or that the police department was ordered to stand down.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of a permit and alleged harassment of neighbors by the protesters constitutes an illegal occupation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by ACLU PA deputy legal director Mary Catherine Roper, who states that the protest did not require a permit and did not violate any laws."}
