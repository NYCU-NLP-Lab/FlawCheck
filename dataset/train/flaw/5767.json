{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by stating that it has \"unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that a cease-and-desist order is not meant to shut down businesses but to stop them from violating the law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau granted itself the authority to shut down businesses for any reason. The expert's verdict clarifies that the power to issue cease-and-desist orders was granted to the agency by Congress through the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate its assertion that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has the power to shut down businesses at any time it wishes. The expert's verdict provides a detailed explanation of how cease-and-desist orders are actually used by the agency.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose and scope of cease-and-desist orders. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the rule is not meant to gut businesses' rights and is typical of other federal and state financial regulators."}
