{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Mexico is paying for the wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. It implies that Mexico is fully funding the wall, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Mexico is actually paying for the wall through the trade deal. The expert's analysis highlights that the trade deal does not include any language stating that Mexico will pay for the wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funds from the USMCA Trade Deal are directly contributing to the construction of the wall. However, the expert's analysis points out that the trade deal does not add new tariffs on goods from Mexico to the United States, and any potential tariffs would be paid by Mexican exporters, not the Mexican government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis presents an alternative explanation by stating that the trade deficit between Mexico and the United States does not determine the ability to fund the wall. This challenges Trump's claim that Mexico can afford to build the wall based on the trade surplus with America."}
