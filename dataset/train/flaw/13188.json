{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it states that the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump sent fundraising emails with the date \"September 31st,\" which is a non-existent date. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the Trump-Pence campaign later sent the same recipient an identical email, but with a new subject of \"Time is running out.\" This indicates that the campaign realized the error and corrected it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only mentions that the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump sent fundraising emails with the date \"September 31st.\" It does not provide any evidence or further details to support this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the fundraising emails with the date \"September 31st\" were intentional and not a mistake. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any conclusive evidence to confirm or refute this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for why the fundraising emails contained the date \"September 31st.\" Therefore, this bias does not apply."}
