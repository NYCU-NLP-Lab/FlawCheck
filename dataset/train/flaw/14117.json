{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"40 percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the number provided by Neera Tanden was based on a year-end round up from the Human Rights Campaign, but it does not provide further details on the methodology or specific data used to arrive at that number.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not provide a clear distinction between states that are tolerant of gay marriage and those that allow civil unions. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure of 38.37 percent of the population living in states that allow same-sex marriage does not include civil unions. Therefore, the claim does not accurately convey the distinction between states that allow gay marriage and those that allow civil unions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for changing views towards the gay community. While the claim attributes the changing views to the increasing number of states that recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions, it does not explore other factors such as shifting societal attitudes or advocacy efforts that may contribute to changing views.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the progress made in recognizing same-sex relationships. The expert's verdict mentions that as of the time of the analysis, gay marriage is legal in 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, and civil unions or domestic partnerships are allowed in three states. However, the claim only mentions \"states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions,\" which may not fully capture the extent of legal recognition for same-sex relationships.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trend towards tolerance of gay marriage or civil unions will continue based on the changing views towards the gay community. However, the claim does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. It is possible that public opinion and legal landscape may change in the future, but the claim does not address this uncertainty."}
