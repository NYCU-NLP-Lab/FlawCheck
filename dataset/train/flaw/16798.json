{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of Americans living in a place where the water they drink is unsafe. The expert's verdict mentions that the statement reflects an estimate of potentially unsafe water exposure, but it does not specify how many of the 63 million people were actively affected or for how long.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the specific number of 60 million Americans. The expert's verdict mentions that the estimate is based on a 10-year analysis of violations in the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System, but it does not provide further details or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the unsafe drinking water is solely due to aging systems and climate change, without considering other potential factors. The expert's verdict mentions that contaminants can come from various sources such as natural rock, factory chemicals, and farming practices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the unsafe drinking water, such as infrastructure issues, inadequate treatment processes, or human error. The expert's verdict mentions that some places had resolved their water issues, indicating that not all cases of potentially unsafe water are solely due to infrastructure problems."}
