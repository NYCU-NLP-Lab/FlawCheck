{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of births in Wisconsin and Milwaukee that are paid for by taxpayers. The actual percentages are 45.6% for Wisconsin and 59.7% for Milwaukee, not the claimed 45% and 60% respectively.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement. The only evidence provided is the statistics for 2008, which may not accurately represent the current situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taxpayer funding for births is a negative aspect, suggesting that it contributes to being \"broke.\" This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the percentage of births funded by taxpayers, such as the socio-economic factors or healthcare policies in Wisconsin and Milwaukee."}
