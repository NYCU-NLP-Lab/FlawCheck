{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by Fox News by falsely stating that they \"confirmed Obama rigged the election with 4 million illegal votes.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove the assertion that Obama rigged the election with illegal votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by J. Christian Adams on Fox News about ineligible and dead voters automatically translates to \"4 million illegal votes\" in the 2016 election, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the statement made by Adams, such as outdated registrations and voter eligibility issues, rather than direct evidence of voter fraud.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the study mentioned by Adams did not find evidence of actual voter fraud due to the issues of deceased people still listed as eligible voters and people registered in multiple states."}
