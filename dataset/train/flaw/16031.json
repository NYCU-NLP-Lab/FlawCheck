{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific federal law mentioned that prohibits universities from checking the immigration status of their students.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that universities are not required to check the immigration status of their students based on federal law, which is a problematic assumption as there is no such law explicitly mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why universities do not check the immigration status of their students, such as university policies or ethical considerations, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on statements from U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett and Denise Trauth, but their statements do not provide clear evidence supporting the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no specific federal law mentioned that prohibits universities from checking the immigration status of their students.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which federal law prevents universities from checking the immigration status of their students, as there is no clear evidence to support this assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential reasons why universities do not check the immigration status of their students, as it solely focuses on federal law without considering other factors."}
