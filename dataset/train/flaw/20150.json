{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"human meat found in McDonald's meat factory\" is an exaggerated statement as there is no evidence or factual basis to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its validity. There is no credible source or publication mentioned in the post, and the original article was published by a website known for publishing joke articles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a minute trace of human DNA in a veggie burger from a different source is evidence of human meat being used in McDonald's burgers, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that McDonald's affirms their patties are made from 100 percent real beef and there is no record of them using human meat.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The presence of a minute trace of human DNA in a veggie burger could have alternative explanations, such as contamination from a factory worker, rather than the deliberate use of human meat."}
