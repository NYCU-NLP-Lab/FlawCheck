{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the United States has \"one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth.\" While it is true that the voter turnout in the United States is relatively low compared to some other countries, the claim uses strong language (\"one of the lowest\") that could be seen as an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Sanders campaign had not provided sources to back up the claim. This lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voter turnout in the United States is low compared to other major countries on earth. This assumption may be problematic because it does not take into account the specific factors and contexts that contribute to voter turnout in different countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low voter turnout in the United States. It does not explore other factors that may contribute to voter turnout, such as voter registration processes, accessibility to polling stations, or voter engagement initiatives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts, but it may be seen as contradicting the perception that the United States has high voter turnout. This perception may be based on the assumption that the United States is a democratic country with a strong civic culture.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of voter turnout in the United States. It focuses on the low turnout without considering other aspects of the voting system or potential improvements."}
