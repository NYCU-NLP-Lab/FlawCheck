{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are a number of studies backing up the claim, but it also states that teasing out the impact of work requirements alone is complicated and that there is much more research on welfare reform. This suggests that there may not be enough specific and direct evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that work requirements are the sole factor in helping impoverished families move to self-sufficiency. The expert's verdict mentions that work requirements were part of a broader welfare reform, and other factors such as accountability, administrative flexibility, and expanded programs may have also contributed to the outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that while work requirements were effective at cutting welfare rolls and increasing employment, they fell short in making people self-sufficient. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to self-sufficiency beyond work requirements alone."}
