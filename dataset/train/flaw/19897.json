{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of gun deaths since 1968 compared to the number of deaths in all wars in U.S. history. The expert's verdict suggests that the gap between the two totals may be smaller than stated in some versions of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the comparison between gun deaths and deaths in wars.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all gun deaths since 1968 involve American citizens, which may not be accurate. The expert's verdict highlights that not everyone killed by firearms in the United States was an American citizen, but the claim uses \"Americans\" for rhetorical effect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of deaths in wars, such as the involvement of non-American citizen combatants. The expert's verdict acknowledges that a significant number of Civil War deaths might have involved non-American citizen combatants but counts them all as \"Americans.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of gun deaths in the U.S. since 1968 exceeds even relatively high estimates of the number of deaths in all wars in American history.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication that the claim falters at times or contains inconsistencies in its presentation."}
