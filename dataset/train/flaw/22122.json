{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of COVID-19 deaths per day by stating that there are only 56 deaths, which may downplay the severity of the disease.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there are only 56 COVID-19 deaths per day worldwide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing COVID-19 deaths to deaths from other diseases is a valid and meaningful comparison, which may not be accurate or relevant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the number of reported COVID-19 deaths per day, such as underreporting or varying testing capabilities in different countries.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that COVID-19 has a rapidly growing mortality rate and is a newly-formed disease, making it inappropriate to compare it to other longstanding diseases in terms of mortality rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of data or use of visualizations, as experts question the choice of data and the misleading nature of the chart used to support the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of COVID-19 deaths per day worldwide by suggesting that there are only 56 deaths, potentially minimizing the seriousness of the disease."}
