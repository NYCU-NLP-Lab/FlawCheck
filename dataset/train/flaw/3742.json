{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which opioids and other drugs are coming through legal points of entry. The expert states that \"the majority of opioids and all kinds of other things that are connected to the opioids are coming through the point of entry,\" which may be an exaggeration considering that drugs can also enter through other means.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that the majority of opioids are coming through legal points of entry. The expert's statement does not provide specific data or sources to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that building a wall would not prevent the influx of opioids, without providing a clear explanation or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the influx of opioids, such as drugs entering through other means or being produced domestically.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the Drug Enforcement Agency, which states that the southwest border remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States. This suggests that opioids are also entering through the border, not just legal points of entry.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent argument. It jumps between discussing the majority of opioids coming through legal points of entry and the ineffectiveness of a wall, without fully explaining the connection or providing sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the potential impact of a wall in impeding the flow of illicit drugs. The expert states that \"from most of the experts, [a wall] doesn't make a difference,\" but fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of expert opinions or evidence supporting this statement."}
