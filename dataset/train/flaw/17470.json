{"Lack enough support": "The claim that a red fox screams when it finds its perfect mate is not supported by any scientific research or evidence. It is based on a random comment made by a Tumblr user without any factual basis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the behavior shown in the Vine video of two foxes growling at each other represents the foxes finding their perfect mates. However, experts suggest that the behavior is more likely a form of conflict resolution or ritualized aggression.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the behavior shown in the Vine video is not related to foxes finding their soulmates. The \"Why Animals Do The Thing\" Tumblr page and the \"Icelandic Stripper Boots\" Tumblr page, where the claim originated, both admit that the claim was completely made up.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts provide an alternative explanation for the behavior shown in the Vine video, suggesting that it is a form of conflict resolution or ritualized aggression rather than foxes finding their perfect mates.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to support the claim that red foxes scream when they find their perfect mate. The claim is completely unfounded and lacks any factual basis.", "Exaggerate": "None of the sources provided in the expert's verdict exaggerate the claim."}
