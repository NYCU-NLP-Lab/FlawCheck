{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single image without providing a source or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the information in the image is universally accurate for all rape or sexual assault victims, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations for the information provided in the image, as it lacks specific jurisdictional details.", "Falters at times": "The information in the image may falter at times, such as making promises that might not always be true, such as the availability of a hospital escort.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks or limitations of preventive care following an assault, as the efficacy of such treatments decreases over time.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no sweeping guarantee in the United States that any third party is prohibited from reporting a suspected rape or assault to local authorities, as mandated reporters may be bound to report such cases.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
