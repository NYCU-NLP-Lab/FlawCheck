{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens\" is an exaggeration as the data provided shows that the number of murder charges involving undocumented immigrants is significantly lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the data provided does not specifically break down the number of murder charges and convictions by group (legal non-U.S. citizen vs. illegal non-U.S. citizen).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by linking all non-U.S. citizens arrested for a crime in Texas, including those living in the United States legally, to illegal aliens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the high crime rate among non-U.S. citizens, such as socio-economic factors or other demographic variables."}
