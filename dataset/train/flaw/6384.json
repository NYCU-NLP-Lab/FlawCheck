{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the increase in hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques by stating that they have tripled after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks. The expert's verdict confirms that there was a spike in hate crimes during that period, but it does not provide evidence of a threefold increase.", "Lack enough support": "While the expert's verdict mentions calculations by Brian Levin that generally support Clinton's assertion, it does not provide detailed data or statistics to fully support the claim. The information provided is limited to a comparison of hate crime numbers before and after the attacks, without a comprehensive analysis of long-term trends.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the Paris and San Bernardino attacks and the increase in hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques. While there is evidence of a spike in hate crimes during that period, it does not necessarily prove a direct cause-effect relationship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that spikes in hate crimes have occurred in the past after racially charged events, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in hate crimes after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks. This implies that factors other than the attacks themselves could have contributed to the rise in hate crimes.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the severity of hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques by focusing only on the increase after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks. The expert's verdict mentions that anti-Muslim incidents have ranked second to anti-Jewish incidents among all anti-religious hate crimes since 9/11, indicating a broader issue that extends beyond the specific time period mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques over a longer period. The expert's verdict mentions data for a specific month-long period, but it does not provide a broader context or a comparison to previous years.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any known facts or information provided in the expert's verdict."}
