{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the WHO says a child's presence at school is enough consent for vaccination. The WHO's report mentions an \"implied consent process\" but does not explicitly state that a child's presence at school implies consent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a screenshot of an article without providing the full context or additional evidence to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the WHO's report applies to all vaccinations, including COVID-19 vaccinations, when the Ministry of Health spokesperson clarifies that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is only approved for individuals above the age of 16.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that written consent from parents/guardians is required for children under the age of 16 to receive vaccinations at school, as stated by the New Zealand Ministry of Health.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
