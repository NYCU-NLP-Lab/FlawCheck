{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Sen. Patrick Testin's responsibility for the lost $25 million in federal funding. The expert's verdict highlights that Testin, like most lawmakers, does not have the power to schedule legislative sessions, which ultimately determines when the Assembly and Senate meet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sen. Patrick Testin's refusal to do his job is solely responsible for the lost federal funding. However, the expert's verdict suggests that other top-ranking Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, could also be held accountable.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to directly link Sen. Patrick Testin's actions or inaction to the lost $25 million in federal funding. The expert's verdict mentions that the Democratic committee focused primarily on Testin's role, but it does not provide concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Republican leaders in the Senate and Assembly did not schedule floor sessions to take up a package backed by Gov. Tony Evers until three weeks after the federal legislation passed. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the lost funding, such as delays caused by the GOP-controlled Legislature as a whole, rather than solely attributing it to Testin's actions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexities and factors involved in the legislative process and decision-making. The expert's verdict highlights that Testin, as chairman of a key health-related committee, can lobby leaders to schedule floor sessions, but the power to determine when the Assembly and Senate meet largely lies in the hands of leadership. This suggests that Testin's influence may be limited in this specific context."}
