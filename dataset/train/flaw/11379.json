{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation that 100,000 ballots were backdated in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged backdating of ballots, even if true, would have had a significant impact on the election results, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Wisconsin deadline for ballot counting is based on when the ballots are received, not postmarked.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated by suggesting a large number of 100,000 backdated ballots without substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the alleged conversations between the USPS contractor and workers, such as misinterpretation or misunderstanding.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on the account of a single individual and presenting it as evidence without additional corroboration.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect."}
