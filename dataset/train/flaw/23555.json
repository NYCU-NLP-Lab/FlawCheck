{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the ratio of dollars lost by individuals to the dollars received by the state in taxes. The expert's verdict states that the ratio is actually 1:6, but the claim presents it as an absolute statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that for every dollar the state receives in taxes, somebody loses $6. The expert's verdict mentions a report from 2005, but it is not clear if this data is directly applicable to the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all gambling revenue comes from individuals losing money, without considering other sources such as winnings or profits from casinos.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the ratio of dollars lost to dollars received in taxes depends on the type of gambling being considered. Therefore, there could be alternative explanations for the ratio that are not addressed in the claim."}
