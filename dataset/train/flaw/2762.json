{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the constitutional requirement for the census, as the expert's verdict states that the Constitution does not specifically require only the number of people in a household to be provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ACORN's involvement in the census and privacy concerns justify providing only the number of people in the household. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption is problematic and not supported by the Constitution or historical census practices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the assertion that only the number of people in the household is required by the Constitution. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Constitution itself and historical examples that contradict this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Constitution does not explicitly require only the number of people in a household to be provided for the census, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and depth of the questions asked in the census, as the expert's verdict mentions that the census data has become intricate and personal, with many questions beyond just the number of people in a household.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the questions asked in the census and the involvement of organizations like ACORN. The expert's verdict suggests that the questions serve various purposes and that ACORN's involvement is not a valid reason to withhold information beyond the number of people in a household.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its understanding and interpretation of the constitutional requirement for the census, as the expert's verdict points out the inaccuracies and misconceptions in the claim."}
