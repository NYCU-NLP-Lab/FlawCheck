{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of animals killed in the Australia wildfires, stating that over 480 million animals have died, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the image shows animals burning in the Australia wildfires.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image is related to the current wildfires in Australia, which is proven to be false.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image is from 2012 and depicts a bonfire of confiscated taxidermy animals in Jakarta, Indonesia, not animals killed in a fire in Australia.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the image could be unrelated to the Australia wildfires and may have been shared with misleading information."}
