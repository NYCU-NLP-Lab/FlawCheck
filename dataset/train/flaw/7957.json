{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on Wisconsin farmers by stating that they \"can't afford\" it without providing specific evidence or data to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"Wisconsin lost over 600 farms last year.\" The expert's investigation only found a loss of 676 dairy farms, but it is unclear if this includes non-dairy farms and if the overall total is growing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between the #TrumpShutdown and the loss of farms in Wisconsin without providing evidence or considering alternative explanations for the decline in farms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert raises the question of whether the decline in farms in Wisconsin is solely attributable to the #TrumpShutdown or if there are other factors at play, such as changes in the agricultural industry or economic conditions.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on Wisconsin farmers by not fully addressing the potential consequences of the shutdown on direct payments, farm loans, and disaster assistance programs."}
