{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or documentation to verify the statement that tax returns were released for 12 years in a row.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bloomberg never released his full tax returns as mayor, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the transparency of Bloomberg's tax returns by stating that they were released for 12 years in a row, when in fact, they were not fully released during his mayoral tenure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that releasing tax returns for 12 years in a row as mayor is a significant accomplishment or indicator of transparency, without providing any context or justification for this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and consistent explanation of the release of tax returns, as there are conflicting reports and statements regarding Bloomberg's tax return disclosures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Bloomberg did not fully release his tax returns as mayor, such as potential legal or privacy concerns, but these are not explored or addressed in the claim."}
