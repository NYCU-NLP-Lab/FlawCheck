{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single poll conducted by the League of Conservation Voters, which may not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe climate change is happening.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the poll conducted by the League of Conservation Voters is a reliable and unbiased source of information, despite being commissioned by an environmental group with a perspective and stake in the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the results of the poll, such as potential biases in the wording of the survey questions or the influence of social desirability bias on respondents' answers.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of voters 18 to 34 who don't believe climate change is happening, as it only considers the response option \"Climate change is not really happening\" and does not account for those who may hold more nuanced or uncertain views on the topic.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to accurately represent the beliefs of all voters 18 to 34, as it relies on a single poll and does not account for the diversity of opinions within this age group.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of agreement among voters 18 to 34 on the existence of climate change, as it suggests that only 3 percent of this demographic hold disbelief in climate change, without considering the margin of error or potential biases in the poll.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific factual information, as the provided information does not mention any specific contradictory evidence or facts."}
