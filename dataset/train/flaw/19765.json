{"Lack enough support": "The expert acknowledges that the sample size of games played in cold weather is relatively small, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions about Manning's performance.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that Manning's statistics, such as completion percentage and yards, are slightly lower in games under 50 degrees, and interceptions are higher. This suggests that Manning's performance may not be as strong in colder temperatures.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert raises the question of whether all quarterbacks perform worse in cold weather and highlights the challenging conditions that can affect passing performances. This implies that attributing Manning's struggles solely to cold weather may be an oversimplification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that Manning's Colts often played home games in a controlled environment during the playoffs, which could have influenced his overall statistics in cold weather games. This suggests that factors other than cold weather alone may have contributed to Manning's performance in such games."}
