{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Indonesian government is urging Malay Muslims to eat pork, when in fact the video shows an event in Bali encouraging locals to eat pork after an African Swine Fever outbreak.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no prohibition against eating pork in Hinduism, unlike Islam. The claim suggests that the Indonesian government is urging Malay Muslims to eat pork, which goes against the religious beliefs of Islam.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a misleading Facebook post and a video without proper context. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the original video and reports from local media to support the true explanation of the video.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows the Indonesian government urging Malay Muslims to eat pork, without considering the context of the event in Bali and the religious beliefs of the majority population in Bali.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the video is actually from an event in Bali aimed at raising awareness about the safety of eating pork after an African Swine Fever outbreak."}
