This suggests that there were some difficulties or obstacles in obtaining more information or verifying the claims made in the ad.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any biases that understate the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of any biases that exaggerate the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of any biases that contradict the fact."}
