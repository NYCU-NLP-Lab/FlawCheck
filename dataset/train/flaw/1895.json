{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of \"bad math\" on Wisconsin's positive test rate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the importance of using the number of people tested instead of the raw number of tests to calculate test positivity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that errors in the state Department of Health's calculations are causing the increase in the positive test rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current method of calculating test positivity is flawed without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in Wisconsin's positive test rate, such as a surge in coronavirus cases in September."}
