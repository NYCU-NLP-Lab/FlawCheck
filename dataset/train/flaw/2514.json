{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Gov. Scott Walker's actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs, which implies a significant impact on job losses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on estimates and projections from sources, rather than concrete evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between Gov. Walker's actions and job losses, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the job market.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of Gov. Walker's actions on job losses, as it only focuses on a specific number (15,000 jobs) and does not account for potential additional job losses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for job losses, such as economic downturns or changes in industries, which could also contribute to the overall job market situation."}
