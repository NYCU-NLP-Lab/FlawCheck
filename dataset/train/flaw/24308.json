{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of spoiled coronavirus vaccines in North Carolina by stating that it is \"very small ... in the tens.\" However, the actual number of spoiled doses is in the four digits, not two.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the number of spoiled vaccines is \"very small.\" The claim is based on \"one-off conversations\" with health officials rather than a comprehensive analysis or official report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a small number of spoiled doses indicates an effective rollout of the vaccine. However, the effectiveness of the rollout cannot be solely determined by the number of spoiled doses, as there may be other factors to consider.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of spoiled doses, such as issues with storage, distribution, or mishandling of the vaccines.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual number of spoiled doses in North Carolina is in the four digits, not the \"very small\" number stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by providing inaccurate information about the number of spoiled doses, which undermines its credibility.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim does not necessarily exaggerate the number of spoiled doses, it does downplay the actual extent of the problem by stating that it is \"very small ... in the tens\" when it is in the four digits."}
