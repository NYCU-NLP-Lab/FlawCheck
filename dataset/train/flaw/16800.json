{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the chances of Biden winning Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, and Wisconsin independently after Trump's early lead by stating it is less than one in a quadrillion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a questionable statistical analysis and a court filing that misrepresents the expert's analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes implausible assumptions about the 2020 election and the statistical analysis used to calculate the chances of Biden's victory.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Biden's victory, such as the counting of mail-in ballots before and after Election Day and the difference in performance between Biden and Clinton in those states."}
