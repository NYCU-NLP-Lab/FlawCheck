{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of asylum-seekers that will be immediately let in. The expert's verdict states that the plan is to admit about 300 people per day from among an estimated 25,000 people with \"active cases\" in the former MPP program. However, the claim only mentions the immediate admission of 25,000 asylum-seekers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific sources to back up the statement. The expert's verdict mentions a news release from the Department of Homeland Security, but it does not directly support the claim made by Senator Ron Johnson.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the asylum-seekers who will be let in do not have valid asylum claims and will likely stay even when their claims are denied. This assumption is not supported by the evidence provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the admission of asylum-seekers. It presents a single viewpoint without acknowledging any potential counterarguments or differing opinions."}
