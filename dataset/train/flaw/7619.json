{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Metro Atlantans spend \"over an hour every day\" or \"five hours a week\" commuting, for a total of \"260 hours a year.\" The expert's verdict mentions that there are a few problems with this calculation, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerating the amount of time spent commuting.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are problems with the calculation made in the claim, indicating that it may falter or be inaccurate at times.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on data from a February 2012 report from the Georgia Department of Transportation. However, it does not provide any additional evidence or support for the claim, suggesting that it may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average commute time for Metro Atlantans is one hour every day, without considering variations for different individuals or circumstances. This assumption may be problematic as it generalizes the commute experience for all residents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the ad was sponsored by the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network to promote a referendum on raising sales taxes for transportation projects. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may be biased towards supporting the referendum and may not provide a complete or unbiased view of the commuting situation in Metro Atlanta."}
