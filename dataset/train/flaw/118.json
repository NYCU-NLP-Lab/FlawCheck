{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the Obama administration is using Common Core to effectively turn the Department of Education into a national school board. This could be seen as an exaggeration, as the expert's analysis indicates that Common Core is a set of national education standards, but no state is required to adhere to them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration is using Common Core with the intention of turning the Department of Education into a national school board. However, the expert's analysis suggests that the goal of Common Core is to better prepare students for college and careers, not to centralize control over education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Common Core is being used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into a national school board.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis presents an alternative explanation to the claim, stating that Common Core is a national imperative aimed at ensuring consistent academic concepts across states, rather than a federal government program for centralizing control over education."}
