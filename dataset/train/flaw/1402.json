{"Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research, which found that three-quarters of thermal paper receipts contain bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disruptor linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers. However, the study only analyzed a small sample size of receipts from Brazil, Spain, and France, so more comprehensive research is needed to determine the extent of the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of chemicals on grocery store receipts is a widespread problem. While the provided evidence suggests that a significant portion of thermal paper receipts contain BPA, it does not specify if this is true for all grocery store receipts or if there are alternative types of receipts that do not contain these chemicals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of chemicals on grocery store receipts. While the claim focuses on thermal paper and its potential to contain BPA, it does not explore other potential sources of chemical exposure, such as ink or other additives used in the printing process.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential health concerns associated with exposure to BPA and BPS. The expert's verdict mentions that BPA has been linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers, while BPS has been linked to hormonal disruption and the multiplication of breast cancer cells. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the potential health risks associated with these chemicals.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the presence of chemicals on grocery store receipts. It presents the findings of a study that suggests a significant portion of thermal paper receipts contain BPA, but it does not make any exaggerated claims about the prevalence or severity of the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. The expert's verdict supports the claim by providing evidence from a study and discussing the potential health risks associated with exposure to BPA and BPS.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any point. It presents a clear statement about the presence of chemicals on grocery store receipts and is supported by evidence from a scientific study."}
