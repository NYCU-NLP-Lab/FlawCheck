{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that the claim of wages not going up for a long time is false. The claim exaggerates the stagnation of wages by ignoring the fact that wages have been rising during both Obama's and Trump's administrations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that wages have been increasing for a while now, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that wages haven't gone up for a long time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wages have not increased without considering the evidence that wages have indeed been rising.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the perceived lack of wage increase, such as factors like inflation or specific industries where wages may not have increased significantly."}
