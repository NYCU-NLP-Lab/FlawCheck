{"Lack enough support": "The claim that St. Corona is the patron saint of plagues lacks sufficient supporting evidence. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no historical basis for this claim and it only started circulating after the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that St. Corona is the patron saint of plagues based on her name \"Corona\" being connected to the coronavirus. However, this is a problematic assumption as there is no historical or religious basis for this connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim of St. Corona being the patron saint of plagues is a modern invention and may have been given to her because her name \"Corona\" means crown, which could connect her to the coronavirus. This alternative explanation questions the validity of the claim."}
