{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lead that Donald Trump has in electoral votes by presenting a map that shows him leading Joe Biden, even though Joe Biden is the clear winner of the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a map published on Facebook, which has been flagged as false information and comes from a pro-Trump news outlet with a history of publishing misinformation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden has won more votes than Donald Trump in battleground states and has enough electoral votes overall to be declared the winner of the presidential race.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the map published on Facebook is the \"real electoral map\" and implies that the media has lied about the election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the map, such as incomplete or contested results in battleground states, which are labeled as such on the map."}
