{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that flu cases in Canada have been added to the Covid-19 case count, which may be an exaggeration without sufficient evidence or support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a Facebook post and a chart that is no longer available. There is a lack of concrete evidence or sufficient data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low number of flu cases in 2020 compared to the previous year is suspicious and implies that flu cases may be classified as Covid-19 cases. However, this assumption lacks evidence and may not be a valid explanation for the decrease in flu cases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on outdated data from September 2020, which may not accurately represent the current situation regarding flu cases in Canada.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts provide alternative explanations for the decrease in flu cases, such as the variation in ongoing flu activity and the timing of the influenza season. This suggests that there are alternative explanations to consider rather than assuming that flu cases are being classified as Covid-19 cases."}
