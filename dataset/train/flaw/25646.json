{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of positive cases connected to the Sturgis rally by stating that there were only 88 cases, when in fact there were 124 cases reported by the South Dakota Department of Health and at least 290 cases reported in other states.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the infection rate of the Sturgis rally. The claim states an infection rate of 0.02%, but the correct infection rate is 0.09% based on the reported number of cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a screenshot of a post without any additional evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mass testing of Sturgis workers and residents resulted in no more positive results than the rest of the state average, without providing any evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the spread of COVID-19, such as the possibility of cases being underreported or not properly traced back to the rally.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a recent study found the rally could have resulted in 260,000 cases, indicating a potential bias towards downplaying the impact of the rally.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the rally by stating that it had \"little effect\" on the spread of COVID-19, when there were at least 414 reported cases connected to the rally."}
