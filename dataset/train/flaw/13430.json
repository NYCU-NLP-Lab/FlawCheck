{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Gov. Rick Scott backed the federal shutdown. The expert's verdict mentions that Scott repeatedly bashed Obama and praised Florida's handling of its own finances, but avoided taking a clear stance in favor or against the shutdown. This suggests that the claim may not fully capture Scott's level of support for the shutdown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively conclude that Gov. Rick Scott backed the federal shutdown. The expert's verdict mentions that Scott did not have a vote on the shutdown, and the only way to judge his support is by reading his words. The statements reviewed by the expert do not provide a clear indication of Scott's position on the shutdown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Rick Scott backed the federal shutdown based on his statements and actions. However, the expert's verdict highlights that Scott did not explicitly state his support or opposition to the shutdown. Therefore, the claim's assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Gov. Rick Scott did not explicitly back the federal shutdown but also did not actively oppose it. The expert's verdict mentions that Scott avoided taking a stance in favor or against the shutdown, suggesting that he may have remained neutral or non-committal on the issue. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of Scott's support for the shutdown."}
