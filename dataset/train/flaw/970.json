{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role that Patrick Morrisey played in writing the health care law, implying that he wrote the entire law, when in fact he was part of a collective effort.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Patrick Morrisey wrote the health care law giving free health care to undocumented immigrants. The evidence provided suggests that he played a role in drafting and negotiating the legislation, but does not prove that he personally wrote the provision in question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that providing federal reimbursement for emergency health services to undocumented aliens equates to giving free health care to illegals. This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the specific circumstances and limitations of the law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the provision in question, such as the possibility that it was added or modified by other lawmakers or staff members during the legislative process."}
