While this may be a contributing factor, it does not consider other potential reasons for the employment of foreign-educated nurses, such as a shortage of local candidates or specific skills required.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the employment of foreign-educated nurses in Texas, such as the demand for specialized skills or the recruitment efforts of healthcare institutions.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times due to the lack of specific and up-to-date information to support the statement.
