{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to directly link the photo to a throat infected with the novel coronavirus. The expert's verdict states that the photo is not typical of the coronavirus and that the lesions appear bacterial.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo shows a throat infected with the novel coronavirus without providing any substantial evidence. This assumption is problematic as it contradicts the expert's opinion and the information provided.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo does not show a throat infected with the novel coronavirus, as stated by the expert. The expert explains that the lesions in the photo appear bacterial, not viral.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the photo by presenting it as an \"exclusive picture\" of a throat infected with the novel coronavirus. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the photo does not represent a typical case of the virus.", "Understate": "There doesn't seem to be any evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting the photo as evidence of a throat infected with the novel coronavirus without considering the expert's opinion and the information provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photo, stating that the user who shared it on Reddit was later diagnosed with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in the throat. This suggests that the photo may be showing a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection."}
