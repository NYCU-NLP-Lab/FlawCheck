{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support for marijuana legalization by stating that \"most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that support for legalization has fluctuated over the years and currently stands at 58 percent, which may not necessarily represent a majority or \"most\" Americans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that \"most Americans are ready to put [marijuana prohibition] behind us and move on.\" The expert's verdict references a Gallup poll that shows 58 percent support for legalization, but it does not provide information on the overall percentage of Americans who hold this view.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shift in public opinion towards marijuana legalization is a result of the perceived failure of marijuana prohibition. This assumption may overlook other factors that could contribute to changing attitudes, such as increased awareness of the potential medical benefits of marijuana or shifting cultural norms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the shift in public opinion towards marijuana legalization. The expert's verdict mentions the potential influence of younger generations being more likely to support legalization, but it does not explore other potential factors such as changing attitudes towards drug use or the influence of advocacy campaigns.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by making broad generalizations without providing sufficient evidence. The expert's verdict highlights the fluctuation in support for legalization over the years, suggesting that the claim's assertion of a clear shift in public opinion may not be entirely accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the level of support for marijuana legalization by stating that \"most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on.\" The expert's verdict indicates that 58 percent of Americans support legalization, which could be considered a significant portion of the population.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evident contradiction of fact in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
