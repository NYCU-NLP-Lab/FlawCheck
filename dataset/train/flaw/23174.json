{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Yosemite Sam has been banned from television lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Yosemite Sam's use of guns is offensive and a poor influence on children without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's investigation found no evidence or reports of Yosemite Sam being banned from television, contradicting the claim made in the meme.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact and consequences of Yosemite Sam's use of guns by stating that it is offensive and a poor influence on children without providing any evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation found evidence of another Looney Tunes character, Speedy Gonzales, being temporarily retired from television due to concerns over being an offensive ethnic stereotype. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for a character being removed from television, rather than solely due to the use of guns."}
