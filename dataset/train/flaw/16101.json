{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the screenshots provided in the claim do not show or prove that the votes for Jo Jorgensen became votes for Joe Biden. There is no evidence to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in Jo Jorgensen's vote count automatically translates into an increase in Joe Biden's vote count. However, the expert's verdict points out that Biden's count increased by more than 102,000, not just the 42,038 votes supposedly taken away from Jorgensen.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump's count also increased by more than 128,000, but the social media posts do not link Jorgensen's alleged lost votes to Trump. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the changes in vote counts.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the images used in the claim cannot be verified for authenticity, suggesting that the claim may contradict the fact that the screenshots are genuine.", "Understate": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claim understates any information or evidence.", "Exaggerate": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claim exaggerates any information or evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making unsupported assertions and assuming a direct transfer of votes between candidates without sufficient evidence."}
