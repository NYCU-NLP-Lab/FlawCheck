{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the spending increase proposed by Maggie Hassan by stating it as a $1 billion increase, while the actual increase was around $184 million in general fund spending.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that nearly half of the proposed increase came from federal funds, not New Hampshire state taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the $1 billion spending increase. The evidence provided suggests a much lower increase in general fund spending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a $1 billion spending increase is inherently negative without considering the specific details and context of the proposed budget.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the proposed spending increase, such as the restoration of previous cuts and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."}
