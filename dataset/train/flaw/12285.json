{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the presidents of Rwanda, Malawi, and DR Congo boycotted the World Economic Forum in Cape Town lacks official confirmation from any of the three governments involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presidents' non-appearance at the event was linked to the xenophobic attacks, without concrete evidence or official statements to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The South African and Rwandan governments both rejected the claim that President Kagame's non-appearance was linked to the xenophobic attacks, suggesting that there may be alternative reasons for their absence.", "Contradict fact": "The video captioned \"Rwanda, Malawi, DRC pull out in WEF in light of xenophobic attacks\" does not provide any evidence or support for the claim made in the caption.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any instances where the claim exaggerates or falters at times."}
