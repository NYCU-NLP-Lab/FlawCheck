{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support from reliable sources. No additional sources reported the signing of a 90-day ban on childhood vaccinations by President Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump signed an executive order banning childhood vaccinations for 90 days, without providing substantial evidence or confirmation from credible sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no other sources reported the signing of such an executive order. This suggests that the claim is not accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact and significance of the alleged executive order by stating it as one of President Trump's most controversial decisions to date.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single source, which is a fake news site, and does not provide any additional supporting evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is based on misinformation or a misinterpretation of President Trump's past tweets critical of vaccinations, rather than an actual executive order."}
