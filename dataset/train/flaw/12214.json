{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to confirm that the video shows the last moments of Indonesian plane passengers before the crash. The video is from a different incident and does not provide any direct evidence related to the Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ182 crash.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video in question is related to the Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ182 crash without providing any substantial evidence to support this assumption. It relies on the misleading post on Facebook and the similarity of some scenes in the video, which is not a strong basis for making such an assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is actually from a different incident, specifically a Frontier Flight 226 turbulence incident, as confirmed by the YouTube video's title and caption. This contradicts the claim that the video shows the last moments of the Indonesian plane passengers.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accurately identifying the origin and context of the video. It mistakenly associates the video with the Indonesian plane crash, leading to a misleading representation of the content.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video is unrelated to the Indonesian plane crash and is instead a recording of turbulence during a Frontier Flight 226. This alternative explanation is supported by the YouTube video's title and caption, which clearly indicate a different incident."}
