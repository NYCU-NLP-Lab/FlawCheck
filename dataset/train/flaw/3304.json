{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be an exaggeration because the number of gay marriages performed by Mitt Romney is uncertain and the expert acknowledges that the number mentioned in the claim may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that Romney's spokeswoman denied the claim and the expert could not obtain a response from the person who made the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney performed a specific number of gay marriages while he was the governor of Massachusetts, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that Massachusetts has a law allowing family members or friends to perform marriage ceremonies, including for same-sex couples, under a one-day marriage designation. This suggests that Romney may have approved these designations as required by the law, even though he opposed gay marriage."}
