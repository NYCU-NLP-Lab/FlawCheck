{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of opening two foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London on the increase in exports. The expert's verdict states that the two new offices did not lead to the reported 18 percent increase in exports.", "Understate": "The claim understates the existence of foreign trade offices in New Jersey over the past decade. The expert's verdict provides evidence of 10 full- and part-time overseas offices that were in operation during the past decade.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the claim that the increase in exports is solely due to the opening of the two new offices. The expert's verdict suggests that other factors could have contributed to the increase in exports.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in exports. The expert's verdict suggests that other factors could have played a role in the increase, rather than solely attributing it to the opening of the two offices."}
