{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of San Diego's border barrier in ending illegal crossings by stating that it \"almost completely ended\" them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the border barrier was the sole or primary reason for the decrease in illegal crossings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts point out that factors such as expanded job opportunities in Mexico, rhetoric from Trump, increased technology and staffing, and the presence of tunnels also played important roles in reducing illegal crossings, suggesting alternative explanations to the claim."}
