{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money Rep. Mimi Walters received from insurance interests by stating that she \"took $213,000\" when the expert's verdict states that the ad is slightly misleading on the actual amount.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the health care plan supported by Rep. Walters by stating that it \"strips protections for people with pre-existing conditions and slaps an age tax on older Californians.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the ad overstates what it describes as an \"age tax,\" suggesting that the impact may be less severe than implied.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that Rep. Walters supported a health care plan that strips protections for people with pre-existing conditions and slaps an age tax on older Californians. The expert's verdict mentions that the ad is slightly misleading and overstates certain aspects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rep. Walters' votes and actions. The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Walters voted to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the American Health Care Act, which had different provisions regarding pre-existing conditions and age-related charges."}
