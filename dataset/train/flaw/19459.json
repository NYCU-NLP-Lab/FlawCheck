{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the progress made in halting Iran's nuclear program. While negotiations have contributed to progress in curtailing the means to produce enriched uranium and plutonium, the claim does not address suspected efforts to design nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which are subject to much debate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by not acknowledging the broader definition of Iran's nuclear program, which includes suspected efforts to design nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that it is the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade. It relies on the statement made by President Obama without providing additional sources or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that negotiations with Iran are solely responsible for the halt in Iran's nuclear program, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the observed progress.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the halt in Iran's nuclear program, such as economic sanctions or internal political dynamics within Iran."}
