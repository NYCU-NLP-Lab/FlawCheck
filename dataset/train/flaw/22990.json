The expert's verdict provides evidence that COVID-19 was the primary cause of death for the majority of cases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that COVID-19 was responsible for a significant number of deaths. The expert's verdict provides data from the CDC and other sources to support this fact.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misconstruing data on coronavirus deaths and presenting a misleading narrative.
