{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Marco Rubio's statements by stating that he said \"we should be considering internment\" of Muslims, when in fact he did not call for internment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Marco Rubio compared Muslims to the Nazi party.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marco Rubio's statements about closing down cafes and diners where Muslims gather are equivalent to calling for internment, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Rubio's statements about closing down cafes and diners, as he clarified that it should only be done if those places are being used to inspire attacks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rubio has not proposed anything similar to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II for Muslims."}
