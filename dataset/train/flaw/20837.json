{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the cost difference between fighting in Afghanistan and other places. The expert's research shows that the cost per service member in Afghanistan is roughly double that of Iraq, not three times more as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that it costs three times more to fight in Afghanistan than in any other place. The expert's research only shows a difference in cost per service member between Afghanistan and Iraq.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the higher cost of fighting in Afghanistan is solely due to logistical reasons such as flying everything in. The expert's research mentions other factors such as the landlocked location, less-reliable security, high cost of fuel, and lack of infrastructure contributing to the higher costs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cost difference between fighting in Afghanistan and other places. The expert's research mentions factors such as location, security, fuel costs, and infrastructure that contribute to the higher costs in Afghanistan."}
