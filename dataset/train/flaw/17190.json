{"Lack enough support": "The claim made by Gov. Scott Walker lacks enough support as it is not backed up by any specific data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that winning a higher percentage of the Republican vote and carrying independents by 12 points in the 2014 elections makes him more electable on a larger scale, which may not necessarily be true.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that other Republican governors in the 2014 elections also won a higher percentage of the Republican vote, with some even surpassing Walker's percentage.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the importance of other factors that contribute to electability, such as policy positions, campaign strategies, and overall popularity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Walker's win in the 2014 elections, such as the political climate, the specific characteristics of his opponents, or other unique circumstances that may not necessarily translate to success on a national scale."}
