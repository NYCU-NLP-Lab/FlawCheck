However, there is no evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Andrew Lincoln's family and the Andes plane crash by stating that his father was a survivor who resorted to cannibalism. This is not supported by any factual information.", "Understate": "N/A", "Falters at times": "N/A", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that there is no connection between Andrew Lincoln's family and the Andes plane crash.
