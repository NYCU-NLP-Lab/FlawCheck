{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of hunting licenses sold in the United States by not specifying the exact number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of hunting licenses sold is directly comparable to the number of soldiers in the world's 10 largest armies, which may not be a valid comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that more hunting licenses were sold in the United States than the number of soldiers in the world's 10 largest armies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that comparing the military might of recreational hunters to trained armies involves more than just counting participants, such as access to ammunition, equipment, and military-grade weapons."}
