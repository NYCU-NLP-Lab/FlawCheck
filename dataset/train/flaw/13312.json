{"Lack enough support": "The claim of 750,000 people dying in China each year from auto emissions lacks enough support. The expert's verdict mentions that the World Bank analysis, which could potentially provide some evidence, did not include information about the number of deaths due to air and water pollution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all auto emissions in China are directly responsible for the deaths of 750,000 people each year. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the World Bank analysis had uncertainties about calculation methods and application, suggesting that the assumption may be problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim made by Nancy Pelosi by stating that the World Bank analysis found high air pollution levels in Chinese cities leading to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year, which is significantly lower than the claimed number of 750,000 deaths.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim underestimates the actual number of deaths caused by auto emissions in China. The expert's verdict mentions that the World Bank analysis found that high air pollution levels in Chinese cities lead to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year, which suggests that the actual number of deaths may be higher.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of deaths caused by auto emissions in China. The expert's verdict mentions that the World Bank analysis found that high air pollution levels in Chinese cities lead to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year, which is significantly lower than the claimed number of 750,000 deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, including those from auto emissions, contribute to global warming and the increase of particulate matter and carcinogens in the atmosphere. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the health impacts in China, such as the overall air pollution levels rather than solely auto emissions.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Nancy Pelosi may falter at times due to the lack of supporting evidence and the contradictory information provided by the expert's verdict."}
