{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states that give the governor sole discretion to pick judges. The expert's verdict mentions that \"very few states\" allow this, but it does not provide specific numbers or data to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that North Carolina is one of the \"very few states\" with this system. The expert's verdict mentions some information about other states having merit commissions, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison of the systems in different states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving the governor sole discretion to pick judges is a problematic or unusual practice. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the proposed constitutional amendment would bring North Carolina in line with what \"most other states do,\" suggesting that this practice is common.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or reasons for the proposed constitutional amendment. The expert's verdict mentions that Democrats have decried it as a power shift, but it does not explore other possible motivations or considerations behind the amendment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that North Carolina currently allows the governor to appoint judges to fill vacant seats. The expert's verdict confirms this fact and explains the proposed changes under the constitutional amendment.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of North Carolina's current system of giving the governor sole discretion to pick judges. The expert's verdict suggests that this system is not unique and that many other states have some form of merit commission or assistance in the judge selection process.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information or analysis. The expert's verdict provides some context and information about the proposed constitutional amendment, but it does not explicitly address any inconsistencies or weaknesses in the claim."}
