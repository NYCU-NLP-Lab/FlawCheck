{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Biden exaggerates the progress made in vaccination efforts, particularly in terms of the increase in daily vaccinations. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is misleading and does not provide enough support for the significant increase in vaccinations.", "Understate": "The claim understates the efforts of the previous administration in ordering enough vaccines. The expert's verdict clarifies that the Trump administration had already ordered a sufficient number of vaccine doses, although not all of them had received FDA authorization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that the previous administration failed to order enough vaccines and failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim and shows that the Trump administration had ordered a significant number of vaccine doses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the previous administration had no plan to vaccinate most of the country. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by providing evidence that the Trump administration had plans in place and had ordered enough vaccine doses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in daily vaccinations. The expert's verdict suggests that the increase could be attributed to the efforts of both the Trump and Biden administrations in ordering more vaccine doses."}
