{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a single study conducted by a group of Danish students. There is no mention of any other studies or research supporting the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the results of the study conducted by the Danish students can be generalized to all Wi-Fi signals and their impact on human health. However, this assumption may be problematic as the study only focused on cress seeds and not human subjects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the observed results in the study. The expert's verdict mentions that a 2013 meta-study suggested that there is little immediate concern regarding Wi-Fi exposure and proposed more research on the topic. This indicates that there may be other factors or variables that could explain the lack of growth and mutations in the cress seeds.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the issue by presenting the study as conclusive evidence that Wi-Fi signals harm human health. The expert's verdict mentions that the results of other studies using RF exposures at similar levels as Wi-Fi did not show any biological effects. This suggests that the claim may be oversimplifying the topic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the overwhelming consensus of health agencies around the world is that RF exposures below international exposure limits have not been shown to produce any health hazards. The expert's verdict mentions this consensus and the lack of a biophysical mechanism of interaction.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the study conducted by the Danish students by stating that it has attracted international attention among acknowledged biologists and radiation experts. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or sources to support this claim."}
