{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"high school graduation rates are at all-time highs\" may be an exaggeration, as it is stated that the 2015-16 rate was the highest in a few years, but it is not clear if it is the highest ever.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion of all-time high graduation rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it is mentioned that the definition of dropouts changed in 2005-06, making it difficult to compare graduation rates before and after that period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher graduation rates are solely due to Governor Abbott's actions, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in graduation rates, such as changes in education policies or initiatives implemented by schools or districts."}
