{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that Donald Trump twisted the excerpts from Hillary Clinton's speeches, implying that he exaggerated the content of the quotes.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the quotes provided by Donald Trump were from closed-door speeches leaked by WikiLeaks, but it does not provide additional evidence or context to support or verify the accuracy of those quotes.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that Trump's claim about Clinton wanting the US healthcare system to be like Canada's is a distortion of what the quote actually shows. This suggests that Trump made a problematic assumption based on the excerpts from Clinton's speeches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict points out that the excerpts themselves do not show Clinton advocating for a single-payer healthcare system, but rather expressing a desire to build on the Affordable Care Act to achieve affordable universal healthcare coverage. This suggests that there is an alternative explanation to Trump's claim."}
