{"Understate": "The claim states that \"hundreds of Canadian doctors\" signed the petition, but the expert's verdict mentions that this group only makes up a small fraction of all doctors in the province of Quebec. This implies that the claim may be understating the actual number of doctors involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or statistics to support the statement that \"hundreds of Canadian doctors\" signed the petition. The expert's verdict also questions the authenticity of the signatures, suggesting that there may be a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the doctors signed the petition purely out of altruism, asking for the cancellation of pay deals from which they would personally benefit. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the doctors' opposition to pay increases may be driven by concerns about the working conditions of other healthcare workers and the overall healthcare system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the doctors' opposition to pay increases, suggesting that it may be due to concerns about the working conditions of other healthcare workers and the lack of access to services, rather than purely altruistic reasons. This alternative explanation is not mentioned in the claim."}
