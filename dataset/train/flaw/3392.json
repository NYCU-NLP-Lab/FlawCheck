{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of suspected terrorists who were able to purchase firearms, as it states that 223 out of 244 were successful, while the expert's verdict suggests that the number may be far higher due to unaccounted transactions at gun shows.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the numbers mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations, such as the possibility that some individuals on the watch list may not actually be terrorists or pose a significant threat.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the difficulty for suspected terrorists to purchase firearms by not taking into account potential measures or regulations that may exist to prevent such transactions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all individuals on the watch list are indeed terrorists or pose a threat, which may be a problematic assumption as not all individuals on the list may be involved in terrorist activities.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear distinction between attempted purchases and successful purchases by suspected terrorists.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center list is secret, as it suggests that there were 244 people on the list who attempted to purchase guns."}
