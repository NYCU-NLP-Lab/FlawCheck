{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Michael Madigan in keeping property taxes high and helping cronies like J.B. Pritzker dodge them.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that property tax levies are set at the local level, not by lawmakers in Springfield.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to demonstrate how Madigan's work suggests his clients are \"cronies\" out to game the system.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Madigan, as a state lawmaker, could take action to ensure local property taxes remain high, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Madigan's involvement in contesting appraisals for tax reductions, rather than solely benefiting cronies like Pritzker."}
