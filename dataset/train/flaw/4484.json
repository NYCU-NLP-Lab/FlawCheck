{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the ACE regulation by stating that it will lead to a 34 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 2005 levels in 2030, without providing the context that most of that reduction would happen anyway, not because of the EPA proposal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the ACE regulation will result in a 34 percent reduction in CO2 emissions. The expert's verdict mentions that the data in the EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis actually shows a 33 percent reduction, and that the majority of this reduction is projected to occur without ACE in place.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 34 percent reduction in CO2 emissions is solely attributable to the ACE regulation, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the reduction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the reduction in CO2 emissions could be attributed to factors other than the ACE regulation, as the majority of the reduction is projected to occur without ACE in place."}
