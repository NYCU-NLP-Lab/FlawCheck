{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the potential threat of Iran having an \"industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go\" once the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal expire.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement, which would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Iran will have an \"industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go\" after the restrictions expire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Iran will immediately pursue a military nuclear program once the restrictions expire, without considering other factors or motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Iran's actions or intentions, such as the possibility of continued adherence to nonproliferation agreements."}
