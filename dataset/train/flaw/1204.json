{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that scientific data supports the effects of climate change on rising sea levels.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photos show \"no rise of the sea level\" when in fact they are not accurate representations of sea level changes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides two photos without any scientific evidence or data to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos accurately depict sea level changes over an 80-year period, which is a problematic assumption given the evidence that the photos are not from the claimed time frame.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photos are not reliable evidence of sea level changes as they were taken at different times and do not accurately represent the current state of sea levels."}
