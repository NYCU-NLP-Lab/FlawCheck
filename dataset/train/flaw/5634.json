{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that banks paid Hillary Clinton \"over $1 million\" and are contributing \"millions more\" to elect her. While Clinton did earn speaking fees from banks, the exact amount is not specified, and it is unclear how much banks are contributing to her campaign.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that banks paid Clinton over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's speeches to banks and their contributions to her campaign are inherently problematic or indicative of some kind of corrupt relationship. However, it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Clinton's speaking fees from banks were a result of her experience and expertise, rather than any corrupt or unethical dealings. The claim does not acknowledge this possibility.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of speeches and the amount of money Clinton earned from banks. While it mentions that she made nearly $4 million speaking to financial services firms, it does not provide a comprehensive list of all the banks she spoke to or the total amount she earned from them.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information without proper context or clarification. For example, it mentions that Future45 has received donations from individuals in the financial industry, which could potentially bias their perspective on Clinton's relationship with banks. However, it does not explicitly address this potential bias or its implications.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts, but it does make statements that are not fully supported or substantiated by evidence."}
