{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which third-party groups could sit on voter registration forms for an unlimited amount of time before the law was implemented. The expert's verdict states that the old law required third-party groups to submit the registrations within 10 days, not an unlimited amount of time.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not accurately representing the requirements of the old law regarding the submission of voter registration forms by third-party groups.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to determine the accuracy of the statement that any group could go out anywhere and register voters before the law was implemented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new law was necessary to address a problem of third-party groups sitting on voter registration forms for an unlimited amount of time, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the drop in voter registrations, such as decreased excitement compared to the 2008 race, which makes it difficult to determine the impact of the new law."}
