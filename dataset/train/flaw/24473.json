{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential increase in health insurance premiums by stating that they could be as high as 39 percent. The expert's verdict mentions that Anthem Blue Cross planned to raise premiums by this amount, but it does not provide evidence that all individuals and small businesses will experience such a significant increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that individuals and small businesses will be hit by increases in health insurance premiums as high as 39 percent. The expert's verdict mentions specific cases of premium increases, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of premium trends for all individuals and small businesses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increases in health insurance premiums will directly impact individuals and small businesses. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough information to determine whether this assumption is valid or if there are other factors that could mitigate the impact on these groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that health insurance companies are facing steadily increasing medical costs, which they argue are not sustainable. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the potential premium increases, such as rising healthcare expenses, rather than solely attributing it to greed or profit-seeking by insurance companies."}
