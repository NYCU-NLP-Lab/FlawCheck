{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the legal protections provided by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, stating that it grants \"a license to kill\" and a \"get-out-of-jail free card.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Cuomo \"snuck\" the legal protections into the budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legal protections provide \"blanket immunity\" to health care facilities, which is disputed by nursing home advocates and the state Attorney General.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the inclusion of the legal protections, such as relieving burden on the health care system during the pandemic emergency."}
