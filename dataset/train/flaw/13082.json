{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of the Romney/Ryan budget on interest rates for federal student loans. It states that the rates would be allowed to double, which may be an exaggeration of the actual proposal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that interest rates would double under the Romney/Ryan budget. The expert's verdict mentions that Romney and House Republican leaders have stated they do not want the rates to double.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Romney/Ryan budget would lead to a doubling of interest rates on federal student loans. This assumption may not be entirely accurate or supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that both Obama and Romney expressed support for keeping interest rates at 3.4 percent, indicating that there may be alternative explanations or proposals to prevent the rates from doubling.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the current law, which reduced interest rates on federally subsidized loans to undergraduate student borrowers from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, is set to expire in July. It suggests that the rates would double under the Romney/Ryan budget, while the current law is responsible for the potential increase."}
