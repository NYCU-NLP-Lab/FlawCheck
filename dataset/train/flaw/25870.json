{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of Pakistani flags at Rahul Gandhi's victory procession in Wayanad, Kerala.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Pakistani flags were indeed waved at the procession.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flags waved in the video are Pakistani flags, without considering the possibility that they could be Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) flags.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The presence of IUML flags in the video suggests an alternative explanation for the flags waved at the procession, rather than assuming they are Pakistani flags.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not from Wayanad but from Malappuram, Kerala, and was uploaded before Rahul Gandhi's victory in the elections.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the context and intentions of the video, as it was a campaign rally for the United Democratic Front candidate Rajmohan Unnithan, not a celebratory procession for Rahul Gandhi."}
