{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that PM Modi spends Rs 80 lakh on make-up. The expert's verdict states that no RTI revealing this information was found in media reports, indicating a lack of concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the information received through RTI is accurate and reliable without providing any specific details or sources to verify the claim. This assumption can be problematic as it relies on undisclosed information.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the video used to propagate the claim was actually from the making of PM Modi's wax statue in Madame Tussauds, Singapore. The video shows employees taking body measurements, not beauticians applying make-up.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount spent on make-up by stating that Rs 80 lakh is paid to the beautician each month. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this exaggerated claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an unverified and unsupported claim without providing substantial evidence or sources. The lack of concrete evidence raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the video used to propagate the claim was actually from the making of PM Modi's wax statue, not from a session with beauticians. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's validity."}
