{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida, without considering other factors that could affect their earnings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the No. 2 pick will earn more after taxes than the No. 1 pick.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could influence the earnings of the No. 1 and No. 2 picks, such as signing bonuses, endorsement deals, or other financial factors.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of state tax differences on the earnings of the No. 1 and No. 2 picks, without considering other financial aspects that could outweigh the tax advantage.", "Falters at times": "The claim's argument may falter at times due to the lack of concrete evidence or specific details about the players' contracts, salaries, and potential tax liabilities.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of \"jock taxes\" that professional athletes have to pay when they play in certain states and cities on the road, which could reduce the tax advantage of playing in Florida.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the minimum base salary for a rookie player is the same for both the No. 1 and No. 2 picks, suggesting that there may not be a significant difference in their earnings before taxes."}
