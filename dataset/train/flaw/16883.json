{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mean income of $57,000 is representative of the average family income in the state, which is not supported by the data provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that $57,000 is the mean income in the state for a family.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the mean family income in New Jersey was actually $106,125 in 2010, according to the American Community Survey data.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual mean family income in New Jersey, which was significantly higher than $57,000.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be explained as a misunderstanding or confusion between average family income and average wage in New Jersey, as suggested by Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats."}
