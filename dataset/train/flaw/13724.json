{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Heidi Heitkamp's support for the \"Washington liberal agenda\" by implying that she is a complete \"rubber stamp\" for it, without acknowledging her support for some conservative policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Heidi Heitkamp did not support amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants, as the bipartisan immigration bill she supported would have toughened green card requirements and not provided automatic and immediate citizenship.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Heidi Heitkamp consistently supports the \"Washington liberal agenda\" as it only provides one example of her voting along with Trump's agenda 55 percent of the time, which is not enough to make a definitive conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting the Gang of Eight immigration bill equates to supporting the entire \"Washington liberal agenda,\" without considering other policy positions and votes made by Heidi Heitkamp.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge alternative explanations for Heidi Heitkamp's support for the Gang of Eight immigration bill, such as her desire to address immigration issues in a bipartisan manner and find a compromise solution."}
