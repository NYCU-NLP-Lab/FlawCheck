{"Lack enough support": "The claim of Obama's $4 trillion deficit reduction plan lacks enough support as it is disputed by two Washington think tanks that estimate the deficit reduction to be around $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $1.7 trillion in savings from previous budget freezes and deficit reduction compromises should be counted towards Obama's $4 trillion goal, which is a matter of debate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Washington Post argues that the savings from previous efforts to trim the deficit should not be counted towards the goal, while the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that they should be counted.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the deficit reduction plan falls short of the $4 trillion mark according to the estimates of the two think tanks.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual deficit reduction achieved by Obama's plan, as it only focuses on the $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion estimated by the think tanks and does not consider the $1.7 trillion in savings from previous efforts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effectiveness of Obama's plan by stating a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction, which is not fully supported by the estimates provided by the think tanks."}
