{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the edibility of PLU code stickers on vegetables and fruit by stating that they are edible, even though the expert's verdict clarifies that they are not meant to be consumed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential harm of consuming PLU code stickers by implying that it is not a big deal to eat them, while the expert's verdict cautions against eating them and highlights the difference between \"not harmful to eat\" and \"genuinely edible.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that PLU code stickers are edible, as the expert's verdict mentions the lack of substantiated information and reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because PLU code stickers are made from \"edible paper\" or food-grade materials, they are therefore edible. However, the expert's verdict points out that being made from food-grade materials does not necessarily make them edible.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of PLU code stickers on produce, such as their use for identification and pricing purposes rather than being intended for consumption."}
