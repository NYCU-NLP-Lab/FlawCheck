{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of attacks and deaths that occurred during the Obama administration by only mentioning two embassy attacks and four American deaths. The expert's verdict suggests that there were more attacks and deaths during this time period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the comparison between the number of attacks and deaths during different administrations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of attacks and deaths during the Bush and Reagan administrations were higher than under Obama without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in the number of attacks and deaths, such as changes in global security threats or diplomatic efforts during different administrations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Benghazi attack during the Obama administration resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador. This incident is not mentioned in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in the number of attacks and deaths during different administrations by not providing a comprehensive analysis or considering other factors that may have influenced the numbers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting incomplete information and failing to address the complexities and nuances of comparing embassy attacks and deaths across different administrations."}
