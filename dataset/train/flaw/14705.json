{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decrease in government support for research and development (R&D) by stating that it has fallen by \"nearly two-thirds\" since the 1960s, when the expert's verdict confirms that it has actually decreased by exactly two-thirds (62 percent).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that government support for R&D has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s. However, the expert's verdict provides data from the National Science Foundation and a Congressional Budget Office report to confirm the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in government support for R&D is problematic or negative without providing further context or analysis. It does not consider alternative reasons or potential benefits of the decrease in funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in government support for R&D, such as changes in funding sources or shifts in priorities. It presents the decrease as solely a result of reduced government investment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or evidence, as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the decrease in government support for R&D. The expert's verdict confirms the accuracy of the claim's statement.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times or is inconsistent. The expert's verdict supports the claim's statement."}
