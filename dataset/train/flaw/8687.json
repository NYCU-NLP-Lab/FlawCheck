{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the vandalism by stating that over 200 protesters vandalized Judge Kavanaugh's home, when in fact there have been no reported incidents of vandalism at his residence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Judge Kavanaugh's home was vandalized by protesters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo used in the meme is not of Judge Kavanaugh's actual home, but of a house in Ontario, Canada that was vandalized in 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the vandalism at the Ontario home is connected to Judge Kavanaugh, even though there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo used in the meme is unrelated to Judge Kavanaugh and the vandalism depicted did not occur at his home."}
