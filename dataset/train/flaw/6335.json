{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in state tax burden per citizen between New York and Florida by stating that it is \"twice as high\" in New York.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides the tax collections figures for 2010 without considering other factors such as local taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state tax burden per citizen is the sole measure of the state's tax situation, without considering other factors such as the proportion of income that goes towards taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the difference in tax burden, such as the presence of personal income tax in New York but not in Florida.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New York's tax burden per citizen is not exactly twice as high as Florida's, but rather approximately 97% higher.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering local taxes and other measures of tax burden, which provide a more comprehensive picture of the tax situation in both states.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of measuring tax burden and the overall economic performance of a state, as indicated by the growth in GDP in New York compared to Florida."}
