{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video shows a Filipino rapper being arrested when it actually shows a drunk driver crashing his car in Poland in 2016.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by falsely attributing it to the arrest of a popular Filipino rapper.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides misleading information and does not provide any evidence to back up the assertion that the video shows the arrest of a rapper.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the video is related to the arrest of the Filipino rapper based on the title and text superimposed on the video, without verifying the accuracy of the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility that it could be unrelated to the arrest of the rapper and instead shows a different incident altogether."}
