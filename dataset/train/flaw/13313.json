The expert's analysis indicates that the change in law aimed to streamline the termination process for such teachers, but it does not provide evidence of Van de Putte's intention to prevent their removal entirely.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests an alternative explanation for Van de Putte's vote, stating that the change in law aimed to save school districts time and money by removing certain due process rights for teachers convicted of felonies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no lawmakers were found to have voted to keep schools from firing felons.
