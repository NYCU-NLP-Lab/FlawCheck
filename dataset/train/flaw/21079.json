{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Joe Biden that if President Trump had done his job, all the people would still be alive exaggerates the potential impact of presidential actions on preventing COVID-19 deaths. The expert's verdict states that there is no data or research to support this notion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Biden campaign has not provided any data to support the claim made by Joe Biden. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the President's actions alone could have prevented all COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The expert's verdict points out that even with strict travel limitations, the virus would not have been completely contained.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that even countries with smaller outbreaks than the U.S. have had some deaths from COVID-19. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the occurrence of deaths beyond the President's actions."}
