{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the U.S. would be on a glide path to balancing the budget contradicts the projections from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimated increasing deficits and debt under Trump's proposed budget.", "Understate": "The claim understates the projected deficits and debt that would have occurred under Trump's 2018 plan, as estimated by the CBO.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the U.S. would have balanced the budget under Trump's plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that enacting Trump's 2018 plan would have led to a balanced budget, without considering the differing projections and economic assumptions made by the CBO.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deficits and debt projections, such as the impact of economic growth or other factors."}
