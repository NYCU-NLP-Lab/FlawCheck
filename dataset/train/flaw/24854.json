{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Parent's Choice diapers are causing chemical burns in small children. The expert points out that there is no information or evidence provided to establish a direct connection between the brand of diapers and the chemical burns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any observed rash or burn in a diaper-wearing toddler must be solely and directly related to the brand of diaper worn. The expert argues that this assumption is a logical fallacy, known as post hoc ergo propter hoc, as there could be multiple other factors contributing to the skin reaction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the chemical burns, such as the use of other irritants like laundry detergent or soap. The claim fails to consider these alternative explanations and jumps to the conclusion that the diapers are the sole cause.", "Contradict fact": "The expert points out that early internet warnings have made similar false or unproven claims about other diaper brands like Huggies and Pampers. This contradicts the claim's assertion that Parent's Choice diapers are uniquely causing chemical burns.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the prevalence of diaper-related chemical burns, as the expert mentions that anecdotal reports of such burns circulate for nearly every brand of diapers and wipes. The claim focuses solely on Parent's Choice diapers without acknowledging the broader context.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the danger posed by Parent's Choice diapers by suggesting that major companies would release products without conducting proper testing or that a looming danger threatens all children who wear the brand. The expert argues that these beliefs are unlikely and unsubstantiated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information. The expert mentions that the original post, which served as the basis for the claim, was either removed or restricted and could not be found in a search. The lack of concrete information raises doubts about the claim's credibility."}
