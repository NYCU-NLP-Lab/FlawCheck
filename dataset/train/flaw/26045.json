{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Joe Biden's order on the cost of oil for consumers. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence yet of a spike in oil prices affecting consumers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Joe Biden's order made oil more expensive for consumers to use.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that stopping the Keystone pipeline directly resulted in increased oil costs for consumers, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for any potential future increase in oil prices, such as the inefficiency and increased costs of transporting crude oil without the pipeline option."}
