{"Understate": "The claim may understate the overall trend of wages, as wages have gone up both in the recent past and the longer term when adjusted for inflation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided by the Harris campaign for lagging paychecks is for particular slices of time and doesn't reflect the overall trend.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that paychecks aren't keeping up with the cost of living, when data shows that wages have exceeded inflation for lower-income workers as well as higher-income workers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for the perception that paychecks aren't keeping up with the cost of living, such as the impact of the financial crisis of 2008 on Americans' sense of economic security."}
