{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the profits made by Planned Parenthood by stating that they \"raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years.\" It is unclear if the organization actually made profits or if this number is accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that Planned Parenthood made over $300 million in profits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood is coerced and that 54% of Americans do not want to contribute to the organization. This assumption is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funds received by Planned Parenthood, such as government grants or reimbursements for services provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a broad statement about Planned Parenthood's profits without providing specific details or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Planned Parenthood cannot use federal money to provide abortions, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual profits made by Planned Parenthood if the organization did indeed make profits, but the $300 million figure is an underestimate."}
