{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of votes Bernie Sanders received in Nevada by stating that he \"only had 3,444 votes\" when he actually received 41,075 votes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bernie Sanders received 41,075 votes in Nevada by falsely stating that he only had 3,444 votes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides an inaccurate number of votes for Bernie Sanders without any evidence or source to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of votes Bernie Sanders received in Nevada is insignificant by comparing it to the number of people waiting to pee at a Trump rally. This assumption is problematic as it does not provide a valid comparison or context for evaluating Sanders' performance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation that the creator of the Facebook post was citing preliminary results for county convention delegates, but this explanation is still incorrect as it does not align with the actual number of votes Sanders received."}
