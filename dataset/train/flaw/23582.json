{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the Covid-19 pandemic is a hoax and deliberately planned is an exaggerated statement that goes against the overwhelming evidence and expert consensus on the reality and severity of the pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that the pandemic is a hoax or deliberately planned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a deliberate plan behind the Covid-19 pandemic without providing any substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the conspiracy theories surrounding the pandemic, such as fear-mongering, control over the population, and economic disruption, which suggests that there are alternative explanations for these claims rather than a deliberate plan."}
