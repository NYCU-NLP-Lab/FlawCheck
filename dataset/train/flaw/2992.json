The expert's response addresses these claims but does not provide evidence to support them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that black people owning slaves and white people being slaves were common occurrences, without providing evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's response provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the Irish sent to the Caribbean were indentured servants, not slaves, addressing the claim that white people were slaves."}
