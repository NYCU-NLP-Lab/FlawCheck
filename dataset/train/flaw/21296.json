{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows \"kids in cages\" under the Obama administration is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the photo is from Trump's first term, not Obama's second term.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by using the phrase \"kids in cages,\" which implies a negative connotation, without providing enough context or evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photo was taken in 2014 under the Obama administration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Michelle Obama did not care about the children in cages during the Obama administration, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as the possibility that the conditions in the detention facility improved or changed under different administrations."}
