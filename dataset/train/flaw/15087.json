{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Trump's legal team is on its last leg based on Giuliani's resignation, which may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide evidence or specific details to back up the assertion that Trump's legal team is on its last leg.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Giuliani's resignation from his law firm implies that Trump's legal team is in a critical state, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Giuliani resigned from his law firm to focus more on his work as one of Trump's personal lawyers on the Russia investigation, rather than indicating the downfall of Trump's legal team.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Giuliani resigned from his law firm, not from Trump's legal team, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times."}
