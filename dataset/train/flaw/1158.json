{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in the violent crime rate and homicide rate by stating that it has risen \"by more than 20 percent in just two years\" after 30 years of decline.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully understand the context and factors contributing to the increase in the crime rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the recent increase in crime rates represents a significant shift in the long-term trend, without considering the overall decline in violent crime over the past 30 years.", "Understate": "The claim understates the overall trend of declining violent crime rates over the past three decades.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the recent increase in crime rates, such as changes in reporting methods or localized factors, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the overall trend of violent crime has been declining for the past 30 years, by focusing only on the recent increase in crime rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively curating the data to fit a specific narrative of a crime wave, without providing a comprehensive analysis of the crime rates."}
