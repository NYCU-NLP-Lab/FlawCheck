{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the issue by using the phrase \"falling dismally short\" to describe the candidates' tax returns without providing specific evidence or comparison to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the candidates are falling short of the \"Bruce Rauner standard\" or the \"Mitt Romney standard.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that releasing full tax returns is the standard or expectation for political candidates, without considering alternative perspectives or reasons why candidates may choose not to release certain information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the candidates may have chosen to release only summaries of their tax returns, such as privacy concerns or legal considerations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Daniel Biss, one of the rival candidates, has already released his full tax returns, which undermines the assertion that all the candidates are falling short of the standard.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the comparison between the candidates and the standards set by Bruce Rauner and Mitt Romney, as it does not provide specific evidence or context to support the claim that the candidates' actions are comparable to these standards."}
