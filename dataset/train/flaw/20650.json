{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the United States' ranking in life expectancy by stating that it is \"50th in the world\" when in reality it is either 49th or tied with several other countries.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim falters by not providing enough support for the statement and not considering alternative explanations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only references one source (the CIA World Factbook) and does not consider other sources that provide different data on life expectancy rankings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that other sources, such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Census Bureau Statistical Abstract, provide different rankings and data on life expectancy, suggesting that there are alternative explanations to the claim."}
