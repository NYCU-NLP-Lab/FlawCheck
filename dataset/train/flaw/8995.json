{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the wage gap by stating that the average woman loses around $11,000 every year, which amounts to a $500,000 \"vagina tax\" over her working career.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the stated figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wage gap is the sole reason for the earnings difference between men and women, without considering other factors such as occupational choices, education, and experience.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the earnings difference, such as differences in working hours, job preferences, or career paths chosen by men and women.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual earnings difference by using the average difference of $10,876 instead of considering other data sources that show a smaller annual earnings difference.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single calculation based on Census data, without considering other available sources or methodologies for measuring the wage gap.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the wage gap figure of women earning 77 cents for every dollar earned by men should be used with caution, as noted by fact-checkers."}
