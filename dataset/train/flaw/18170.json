{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in military recruiting during the time when military recruiters were barred from the Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services. The expert's verdict states that military recruiters were only barred for one semester in 2005, and in all other years, they were permitted to use the office.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in military recruiting was directly caused by the actions taken by Kagan and the efforts of the veterans organization. However, there may be alternative explanations for the increase in recruitment that are not mentioned or explored in the provided information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that military recruiting actually went up during the time when recruiters were barred from the office. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is not connected to reality and does not provide specific evidence or statistics to back up the increase in recruitment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in military recruiting, such as external factors or changes in recruitment strategies that may have influenced the numbers."}
