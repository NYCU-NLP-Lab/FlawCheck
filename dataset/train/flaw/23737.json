{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that there are an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide, which would equate to about 20 suicides per day. However, the back-of-a-napkin math shows that the annual rate of suicides would actually mean 15 daily suicides.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the stated statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the suicides are directly linked to the delays at Veterans Affairs medical facilities, without providing concrete evidence to support this connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high suicide rates among soldiers, such as underlying mental health issues or other factors not mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of accuracy and calculation, as demonstrated by the discrepancy between the stated average of 20 suicides per day and the actual calculation of 15 daily suicides.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the annual rate of suicides would result in 15 daily suicides, not 20 as stated.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
