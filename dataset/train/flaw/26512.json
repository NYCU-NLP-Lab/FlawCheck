{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of small businesses on job creation, as the expert's verdict states that small businesses typically generate the most net new jobs, but the exact percentage varies depending on the time period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that small businesses create 70 percent of the jobs in America.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that what is good for small businesses is good for the U.S.A., without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for job creation, such as job creation by local, state, and federal governments, which are not taken into account in the Small Business Administration's findings."}
