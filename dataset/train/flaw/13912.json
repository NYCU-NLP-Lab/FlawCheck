{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video shows Dr. Deborah Nucatola admitting that Planned Parenthood engages in the illegal sale of tissue from aborted fetuses. The video only shows Nucatola discussing how organs were preserved during the abortion process with an eye towards later sale, but does not explicitly show her admitting to illegal sales.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence from the video or any other sources to back up the assertion that Planned Parenthood engages in illegal sales of fetal tissue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the video is a reliable and accurate representation of the practices of Planned Parenthood. It does not consider alternative explanations or question the credibility of the source (The Center for Medical Progress) that released the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the statements made in the video, such as the possibility of Nucatola discussing legal practices related to organ donation for medical research.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video does not explicitly show Dr. Nucatola admitting to illegal sales of fetal tissue. It misrepresents the content of the video.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the information presented in the expert's verdict. It selectively quotes certain parts of the verdict while omitting important context and details.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
