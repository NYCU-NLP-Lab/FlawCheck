It is not clear where the information is sourced from.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having the highest property taxes is a negative thing that needs to be changed. This assumption may not be universally agreed upon.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of presenting a clear and consistent argument. The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that the claim made by Gov. Bruce Rauner may not be entirely accurate or consistent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high property taxes in Illinois that are not addressed in the claim. The claim does not consider other factors that may contribute to the tax burden."}
