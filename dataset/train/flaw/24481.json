{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Jimmy Stewart suffered from PTSD due to his experience as a World War II bomber pilot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jimmy Stewart's wartime experiences directly caused his PTSD without considering other potential factors or influences.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact and severity of Jimmy Stewart's PTSD by simply stating that he was \"flak happy\" and experienced nightmares, without delving into the full extent of his psychological distress.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Jimmy Stewart's changed behavior and career struggles, aside from solely attributing them to PTSD."}
