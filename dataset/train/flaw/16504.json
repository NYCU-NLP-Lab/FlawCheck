{"Lack enough support": "The claim states that Dan Forest has missed almost half of the Board of Education meetings during the pandemic. However, the only evidence provided is a statement from Governor Roy Cooper. There is no additional documentation or independent verification provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that missing almost half of the Board of Education meetings during the pandemic is a negative reflection on Dan Forest's ability to hold the office of governor. However, it does not take into account any reasons or circumstances behind Forest's absences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or provide any alternative explanations for Forest's absences from the meetings. It simply presents the claim that he has missed almost half of them without further context or analysis.", "Contradict fact": "Forest denies the claim and states that he has attended almost every voting meeting and that his staff and advisors sit in on all of the meetings. This contradicts the claim that he has missed almost half of the meetings.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the attendance of Dan Forest by not considering the instances where he arrived late to meetings but was still counted as present. This could potentially impact the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim states that Forest missed meetings on specific dates and attended others in a row before missing more. This suggests a pattern of inconsistent attendance, which could be seen as a bias towards portraying Forest's attendance in a negative light."}
