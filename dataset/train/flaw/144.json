{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered to exaggerate the benefits going to the top 1 percent and large multinational corporations, as the analysis cited by the expert states that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. This is slightly lower than the claim's figure of 83 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it relies on the analysis of the Tax Policy Center, which only provides single-year results for three years and does not allow for cumulative gains and losses over the 10 years of the tax law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the benefits going to the top 1 percent and large multinational corporations are solely due to the Republican tax reform law. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the distribution of benefits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of benefits, such as the expiration of key tax provisions benefiting middle-income taxpayers and changes in inflation calculation that may affect the distribution over time.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it presents a simplified view of the distribution of benefits, not taking into account the variations in different years. The expert's verdict mentions that in 2018, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent, which is significantly lower than the claim's figure of 83 percent.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the benefits going to the top 1 percent and large multinational corporations, as it presents a relatively high percentage of benefits going to these groups.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not seem to contradict any established facts or evidence provided by the expert's verdict."}
