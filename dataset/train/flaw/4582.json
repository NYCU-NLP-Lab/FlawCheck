{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who committed crimes on probation and were not revoked. The expert's verdict mentions that the estimate refers to people who have only been charged with another crime, not convicted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that 5,570 people committed crimes on probation and were not revoked. The expert's verdict mentions that the number comes from a memo on the bill from the state Department of Corrections, but it does not provide further details on the methodology or sources of the estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 5,570 people who committed crimes on probation were not revoked, without considering other factors or alternative explanations. The expert's verdict mentions that the bill being touted by state Sen. Leah Vukmir aims at offenders on supervision, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind probation revocations or alternative explanations for the number provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that reports have documented that thousands of people in Wisconsin are locked up again without being convicted of a new crime. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the number provided in the claim, such as probation revocations based on violations of the rules of community supervision rather than new criminal charges."}
