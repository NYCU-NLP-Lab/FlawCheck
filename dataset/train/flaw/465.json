{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Rick Scott's budget cuts on water management by only mentioning a reduction of $700 million, while the actual difference in budgets is closer to $400 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to fully support the assertion that Rick Scott cut $700 million from water management.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the budget cuts made by Rick Scott directly caused the water crisis, which may be a problematic assumption as other factors could have contributed to the crisis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the budget cuts, such as the claim made by Scott's press secretary that the water management districts independently create their own budgets and the governor does not have direct control over them."}
