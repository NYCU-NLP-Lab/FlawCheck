{"Understate": "The claim may understate the prevalence of intraracial homicides by focusing only on white-on-white crime and not mentioning other racial groups.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully validate the statement, as it relies on data from a 2011 Justice Department report that may be slightly outdated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the term \"white-on-white crime\" is not used, which may be a problematic assumption as it may be used in certain contexts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of intraracial homicides, such as the fact that people are more likely to live, marry, and associate with individuals of the same race."}
