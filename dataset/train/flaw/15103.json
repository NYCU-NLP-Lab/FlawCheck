{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the deterioration of the Sri Lankan wall art featured in the TV show, as recent images show that the artwork remains intact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post featuring a photo comparison, which has been disputed by comments and additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deteriorated wall art is the same as the one featured in the TV show, while it is stated that the \"now\" image does not show the wall at Kandy Vidyartha College.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the deterioration of the wall art, such as neglect or lack of maintenance, which are not addressed in the claim."}
