{"Understate": "The claim made by Rep. Jim McDermott that earning the minimum wage wouldn't get you half the way to the poverty level is understated. The expert's analysis shows that the minimum wage would actually be less than half the poverty level for a six-person family, rather than seven.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that earning $7.75 an hour is insufficient to reach half the poverty level.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that earning $7.75 an hour is not enough to reach half the poverty level without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation by stating that the poverty level only exceeds $32,240 for families with at least seven people, which is a small fraction of all households. This suggests that the claim may not be applicable to the majority of households.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the federal minimum wage is actually $7.25 an hour, not $7.75 as stated by Rep. Jim McDermott.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of earning $7.75 an hour by stating that \"you can't even make half the poverty level\" without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this statement.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing inaccurate information about the federal minimum wage and making assumptions without proper evidence or support."}
