{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the risk of lawsuits and harassment that would be faced by workers in the adult film industry if Prop 60 is passed. This is evident from the statement in the claim that the law would \"put workers in the adult film industry at risk for lawsuits and harassment.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that workers in the adult film industry would be at risk for lawsuits and harassment due to Prop 60. It relies on a general statement without providing concrete examples or statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the requirement of condom use in adult films would lead to an increased risk of lawsuits and harassment for the industry workers. However, it does not provide a clear explanation or evidence for why this assumption is valid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge any alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the potential impact of Prop 60. It presents a one-sided view that suggests only negative consequences for the workers in the adult film industry."}
