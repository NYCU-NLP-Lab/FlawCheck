{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama-era ban on whole and 2% milk in schools is the main cause of the decline in student milk consumption, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide substantial evidence or data to support the assertion that the ban on higher-fat milk options directly caused a \"notable decline\" in student milk consumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that milk consumption has been steadily declining nationwide, not just in schools. This suggests that there may be other factors at play, such as changing dietary preferences or alternatives to milk, that could explain the decline in student milk consumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of other factors, such as changing dietary preferences or alternatives to milk, on student milk consumption. It focuses solely on the ban on higher-fat milk options as the primary cause.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that schools were allowed to offer 1% flavored milk without a waiver in the 2018-2019 school year, suggesting that the ban on flavored milk is no longer in place. This undermines the claim that the ban is still causing a decline in student milk consumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the ban on whole and 2% milk by attributing a \"notable decline\" in student milk consumption solely to this policy change, without considering other factors or potential contributing causes."}
