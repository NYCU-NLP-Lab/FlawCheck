{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by labeling the content on the Snapchat channel \"Cosmo After Dark\" as pornography, when in reality the content is described as \"X-rated\" by the magazine itself.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the measures taken by Snapchat to restrict access to the \"Cosmo After Dark\" channel, as it is stated that the content will only be available to users above the age of 18, not 13.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the content on the Snapchat channel will be shown to children as young as 13. The expert's verdict states that the content will not be available to Snapchat users under the age of 18.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that children as young as 13 will be exposed to adult content on the \"Cosmo After Dark\" channel, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the concerns raised by some parents, such as the possibility of parental controls or restrictions on the Snapchat app that could prevent underage users from accessing the channel."}
