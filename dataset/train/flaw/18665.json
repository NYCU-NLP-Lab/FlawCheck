{"Exaggerate": "The claim that President Barack Obama \"built this $16 trillion debt\" can be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that Obama is solely responsible for the entire debt, when in reality, it only increased by about $5.4 trillion during his presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to directly link Obama to the entire $16 trillion debt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Obama is solely responsible for the entire debt, without considering other factors or contributors to the debt.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in the national debt, such as economic factors, global events, or policies implemented by previous administrations."}
