{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that solid evidence is lacking to confirm that the button seen actually dates from 1992 and was authorized by the Clinton national campaign. It also states that there is no indicator that these buttons were actually made and distributed by the actual Clinton-Gore campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the button featuring a Confederate flag motif was distributed by the 1992 Clinton-Gore presidential campaign. However, the expert's verdict points out that there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation that the buttons were likely made by someone unaffiliated with the campaign looking to make a profit. This challenges the claim's assumption that the button was distributed by the Clinton-Gore campaign.", "Understate": "The claim does not mention any potential doubts or lack of evidence regarding the authenticity and origin of the button, while the expert's verdict highlights the lack of solid evidence and indicates that the button is not an official campaign item.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that the button was distributed by the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, but the expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that there is no evidence to support this claim and that a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton denies its authenticity.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not provide any information suggesting that the claim falters at times.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases listed are present in the claim or expert's verdict."}
