{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase by stating that it put college further out of reach for many Floridians. While the increase may have made college less affordable for some, it does not necessarily mean it put college completely out of reach for many.", "Understate": "The claim understates the reasons behind the tuition increase by only mentioning that it was done to pay for need-based scholarships and retain top professors. It fails to mention other potential reasons such as funding cuts from the Legislature.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the tuition increase put college further out of reach for many Floridians. It would require additional information to determine the actual impact on accessibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase was solely responsible for making college further out of reach for many Floridians. It does not consider other factors that could contribute to the affordability of college education.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tuition increase, such as the need to maintain the quality of education and remain competitive with other states. It presents the increase as solely detrimental without acknowledging potential benefits or trade-offs."}
