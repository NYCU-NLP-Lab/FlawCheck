{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that 50,000 ballots were \"found\" in the Georgia U.S. Senate runoff elections is an exaggeration. Georgia election workers reported legally cast ballots as they were counted and did not \"find\" any ballots.", "Lack enough support": "President Trump did not provide any evidence to support his claim of 50,000 \"found\" ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Georgia election workers did not find any ballots, but rather reported legally cast ballots as they were counted.", "Problematic assumption": "President Trump's claim assumes that the reported ballots were somehow suspicious or illegitimate, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's Republican voting system implementation manager, explained that the reported ballots were not \"found\" but were already known and accounted for."}
