{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the support for the pro-life position by stating that \"over half of Americans\" identify as pro-life, when the most recent Gallup poll indicated a tie between pro-life and pro-choice positions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides one source, a 2009 Gallup Poll, which may not accurately represent the current views of Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the views of the Occupy Providence protesters are representative of all Americans who identify as pro-choice, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fluctuations in poll results, such as sampling error or the impact of calling cell phones in surveys."}
