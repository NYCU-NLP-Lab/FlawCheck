{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the actual number of acres that were auctioned off, as the expert's verdict states that 154,212 acres were put up for auction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or specific details about the auction and the extent of fracking activities on the leased land.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the auctioned land will be subjected to fracking, while the expert's verdict states that it is unclear how much of the leased property will actually be used for fracking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative reasons for the auction of the public land, such as the BLM's energy program that promotes oil and gas development as part of an all-of-the-above approach."}
