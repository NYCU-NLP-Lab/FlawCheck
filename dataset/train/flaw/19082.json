{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Charlie Crist \"voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate\" lacks enough support as there is no evidence to show that Crist voted on the minimum wage when he was a state legislator.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Crist's opposition to raising the minimum wage in the past means he voted against it, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Crist's opposition to raising the minimum wage, as he was a board member of Enterprise Florida, which voted unanimously to oppose the minimum wage increase. This suggests that his opposition may have been based on the position of the organization rather than his personal beliefs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Crist stated he hadn't taken a vote since 1998, which was the tail end of his term in the state Senate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Crist's stance on the minimum wage issue, as it fails to consider his role as a board member of Enterprise Florida and the context of the vote.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to support the claim that Crist \"voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate,\" which suggests that the claim may be exaggerated."}
