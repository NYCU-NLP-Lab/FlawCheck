{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that a face mask vendor was arrested for not wearing a face mask by policemen who were also not wearing face masks. However, the expert's verdict confirms that the claim is false and the image is taken out of context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single screenshot and does not provide any additional evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if police officers can flout the directive on face masks, then the mask seller can do the same. However, this assumption is not supported by any evidence or factual information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it is from a photo essay on the enforcement of the use of pedestrian bridges, not related to the enforcement of face mask usage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that face masks are compulsory in public in Nigeria and the government has set up mobile courts to prosecute people who break the law. The claim suggests that police officers are exempt from wearing face masks, which is not true.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
