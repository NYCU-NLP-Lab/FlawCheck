The expert's verdict mentions that more tests are needed, but the claim does not provide enough information or context to validate the numbers mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of tests per thousand is the sole determinant of whether there are enough tests for reopening the economy. The expert's verdict highlights that experts have different opinions on the specific number of tests required and that testing is just one aspect of an effective strategy to control outbreaks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in testing numbers between South Korea and the United States. The expert's verdict mentions that there may be select locations in the US with enough tests, but as a whole, the US lags behind what is needed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are not enough tests for every American who wants to return to work, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim suggests that there are 17 tests per thousand in the US, implying sufficient testing capacity, while the expert's verdict highlights the lack of availability for all workers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the testing capacity in the United States by stating that there are 17 tests per thousand. The expert's verdict suggests that more tests are needed, and the US still lags behind the necessary testing levels."}
