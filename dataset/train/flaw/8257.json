{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the asteroid by comparing it to the Golden Gate Bridge, implying that it is as large as the bridge when it is actually significantly shorter in length.", "Understate": "The claim understates the distance between the asteroid and Earth, as it is described as passing by at a safe distance of 1.25 million miles, which is more than five times the distance from Earth to the Moon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the comparison between the asteroid and the Golden Gate Bridge. The source of this comparison is not clear, and it is not explained how the similarity was determined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the asteroid's size is the main factor of concern, categorizing it as a potentially hazardous object (PHO). However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the asteroid's predicted path is well-known and there is no chance of it getting closer than 1.25 million miles to Earth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the asteroid's passing by Earth on the first full day of Spring is significant, but the expert's verdict explains that the spring equinox technically begins on March 20 and the following day is considered the first full day of spring, indicating an alternative explanation for the timing."}
