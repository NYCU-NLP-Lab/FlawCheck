{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Planned Parenthood has \"now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts.\" However, there is no evidence provided to support this claim and no legal ruling against Planned Parenthood.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or proof to support the accusation of Planned Parenthood illegally selling baby parts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Planned Parenthood is guilty of illegal activity without providing concrete evidence or a legal ruling.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discussions of payments in the videos, such as the possibility of recouping costs rather than making a profit."}
