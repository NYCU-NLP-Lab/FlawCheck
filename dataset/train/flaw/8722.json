{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that pandemics occur exactly every 100 years. The expert's verdict mentions that there have been numerous pandemics that occurred outside of this timeline.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that pandemics occur with eerie precision every 100 years.
