{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the timeline by stating that Iran will be \"free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons\" in seven years, when in fact the nuclear deal puts a cap on enriched uranium until 2030, or 12 years from now.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the assertion that Iran will be able to create nuclear weapons after the deal expires. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the deal includes limitations and restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Iran will automatically pursue nuclear weapons once the deal expires, without considering the possibility of Iran adhering to other agreements that limit nuclear weapons development.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for Iran's actions after the deal expires. It presents a one-sided view that Iran will definitely pursue nuclear weapons."}
