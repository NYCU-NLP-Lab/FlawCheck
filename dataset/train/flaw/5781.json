{"Lack enough support": "The claim that enslaved people helped construct and build the Old Capitol is supported by very little documentation. There is limited evidence available to confirm this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that enslaved people were involved in the construction of the Old Capitol based on the fact that they played a large role in Florida at the time. However, this assumption is not backed by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While there is limited documentation, history experts suggest that it is very likely that enslaved people did contribute to the construction of the Old Capitol, given their significant role in Florida during that period. However, there may be alternative explanations for the construction that are not explored or considered."}
