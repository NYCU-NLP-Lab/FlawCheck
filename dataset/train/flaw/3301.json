{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that witnesses have been part of \"every other impeachment trial the Senate has ever had.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of witnesses in previous impeachment trials automatically means that witnesses should be included in all impeachment trials. This assumption may not necessarily hold true in every case.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all impeachment trials in the Senate have included witnesses. There have been cases where impeachment trials were halted or did not proceed to trial, resulting in no witnesses being called.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and variability of impeachment trials by oversimplifying the role of witnesses. It fails to acknowledge that the decision to call witnesses can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the discretion of the Senate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of witnesses by implying that their inclusion is a universal and essential aspect of all impeachment trials. This may overlook other important factors and considerations in the trial process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why witnesses may or may not be called in impeachment trials. It presents a one-sided argument in favor of witnesses without exploring potential reasons or justifications for their exclusion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of all impeachment trials in the Senate. It focuses primarily on presidential impeachment trials and overlooks other impeachment trials involving federal officials."}
