{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Dan Branch's attempt to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas. The expert's verdict suggests that the amendment offered by Branch was not a direct attempt to expand late-term abortions but rather to add an additional exception to the existing restrictions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Dan Branch's amendment would have endangered disabled, unborn babies. However, there is no clear evidence or support provided to substantiate this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Dan Branch actively tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas. The expert's verdict mentions that Branch's amendment was part of a larger amendment and was proposed in the context of maintaining state medical regulatory agencies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the existing state law already prohibited third-trimester abortions unless certain conditions were met. The expert's verdict explains that the amendment proposed by Branch was actually an attempt to add another exception to the existing law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for Branch's amendment, which was not mentioned in the 2005 debate. This alternative explanation adds further context and raises questions about the true intention behind the amendment.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a simplified and potentially misleading version of the events. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced understanding of the situation and highlights the complexities involved in evaluating Branch's actions."}
