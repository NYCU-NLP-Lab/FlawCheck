However, the expert explains that the Constitution does not work this way and that the president would nominate a new vice president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any evidence or constitutional basis for why Nancy Pelosi would become vice president in the given scenario.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation to the claim by explaining the process outlined in the 25th Amendment, which states that the president would nominate a new vice president."}
