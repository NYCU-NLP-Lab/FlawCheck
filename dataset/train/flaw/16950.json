{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of indoor air pollution by stating that more people die from it than from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and TB combined. This is because the expert's verdict mentions that the comparison is based on different years of data and different underlying estimates.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the comparison of deaths from indoor air pollution and deaths from infectious diseases is more complicated and less straightforward. Identifying someone with HIV/AIDS, malaria, or tuberculosis is easier than defining the cause of death as indoor air pollution, which can have various contributing factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on data from 2012, while the comparison with deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis is based on 2015 estimates. This lack of updated and consistent data may weaken the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The World Health Organization study used assumptions to link diseases like lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ischemic heart disease to indoor air pollution. This assumption may introduce a potential bias in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the cause of death related to indoor air pollution can be attributed to various factors such as respiratory insufficiency, asthma, heart disease, etc. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for deaths related to indoor air pollution, making it more complex to attribute them solely to indoor air pollution."}
