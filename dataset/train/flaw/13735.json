{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the content of the Netflix show, suggesting that it is intended to make little boys into 'sexy' little girls, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate its assertion that the Netflix show is aimed at making little boys into 'sexy' little girls. The evidence provided only includes a description of the show and a photo of child dancers and a drag queen, but does not provide any specific details or examples from the show itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a drag queen in the show and the description of the show's content imply an intention to sexualize little boys, which is a problematic assumption without further evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the show is simply a reality show about a dance studio, with the drag queen being one of the teachers. The claim fails to consider this alternative explanation and jumps to a more sensationalized interpretation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the show is not new and has been airing since October 2018, which undermines the claim's assertion that it is a new Netflix show aimed at sexualizing little boys.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
