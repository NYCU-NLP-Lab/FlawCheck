{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that 14% of students at UNC tested positive.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not accurately represent the full context of the outbreak at UNC and may give a misleading impression about the extent of the infection rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 14% infection rate among tested students accurately reflects the entire UNC student population, which may not be a valid assumption since testing is not mandatory for all students.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Donald Taylor, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University, who suggests that the testing results may be skewed due to the selective nature of testing at UNC.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual infection rate among UNC students since it only considers the percentage of positive cases among those who were tested, and not the entire student population.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 14% infection rate mentioned by Senator Chris Murphy is not an accurate representation of the entire UNC student population, as explained by the expert's analysis."}
