{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a death curse affecting U.S. presidents elected in years evenly divisible by twenty. The provided information only presents a sequence of deaths and does not establish a causal relationship or provide a comprehensive analysis.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the pattern by stating that all U.S. presidents elected in such years have been affected by the curse, while the expert's verdict highlights exceptions and acknowledges the role of coincidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sequence of presidential deaths is too improbable to occur naturally, leading to the suggestion of a fatal Indian death curse. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence or a thorough examination of alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and coherent argument for the existence of the death curse. It jumps between discussing the sequence of deaths, the role of randomness, and the belief in predestined fatalities, without establishing a strong logical connection.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the sequence of presidential deaths can be attributed to coincidence and randomness, rather than a death curse. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of a curse affecting presidents elected in specific years."}
