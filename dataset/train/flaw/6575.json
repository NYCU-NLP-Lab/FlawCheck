{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Bill McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times while he was in Congress may be an exaggeration, as the supporting evidence provided by Rick Scott's campaign suggests that McCollum voted at least 27 times for legislation that included higher taxes and at least 15 times for legislation that included higher fees.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided by Scott's campaign consists of a string of bill numbers, roll call votes, and internet links, making it difficult to fully analyze and verify the claim. It may lack enough support to definitively prove that McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for legislation that included higher taxes and fees equates to voting for higher taxes and fees directly. This assumption may be problematic as the legislation could have included other provisions or offsets that may have affected overall tax and fee levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for McCollum's votes on legislation that included higher taxes and fees, such as the context of the bills or the specific circumstances surrounding each vote. These alternative explanations could impact the interpretation of McCollum's voting record."}
