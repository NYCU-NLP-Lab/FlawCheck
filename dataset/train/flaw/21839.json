{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that every other person in the field wants to allow people who are here illegally to stay here, without providing sufficient evidence to support this broad statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that every other person in the field supports amnesty. The expert's analysis shows that there are candidates who have different positions on immigration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting legal status for undocumented immigrants automatically equates to supporting amnesty, without considering the nuances and differences in candidates' positions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that some candidates may have changed their views on immigration over time, as acknowledged by the expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using the term \"amnesty\" without clearly defining it, leaving room for interpretation and potential misrepresentation of candidates' positions."}
