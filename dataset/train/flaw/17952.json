{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Americans are working longer hours for low wages and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that wages have been relatively flat since the 1970s, rather than decreasing as stated by Sanders in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence for the assertion that almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the economy is rigged and that this is the main cause of Americans working longer hours for low wages and income inequality, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the concentration of new income among the richest Americans, such as changes in technology or globalization."}
