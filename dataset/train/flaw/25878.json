{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats under Barack Obama's administration. The claim states that there was a 73 percent increase, but the data provided suggests a 73 percent increase between 2008 and 2010, not just in the last two years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the 73 percent increase in the number of federal limousines. The data provided only covers the years 2006 to 2010, and there is no information on the number of federal limousines before or after this period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in the number of federal limousines is inherently reprehensible. It does not provide any specific evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the number of federal limousines. It does not explore potential reasons for the increase or consider any other factors that may have contributed to it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in the number of federal limousines is not limited to the last two years of Barack Obama's administration. The data provided shows a gradual increase in the number of federal limousines from 2006 to 2010, suggesting that the increase did not solely occur in the last two years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and accurate representation of the increase in the number of federal limousines. It presents a specific percentage increase without providing sufficient context or supporting evidence."}
