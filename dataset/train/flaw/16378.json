{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the negative effects of wearing a mask for a long time by stating that it reduces oxygen in the blood.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific studies to support the assertion that wearing a mask for a long time reduces oxygen in the blood.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts provide alternative explanations for potential side effects such as headaches, suggesting that they may be caused by other factors rather than low oxygen levels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wearing a mask for a long time will lead to a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood, without considering the type of mask being used or the individual's underlying lung health.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that for the majority of the population, there are only trivial decreases in blood oxygen levels with surgical or cloth masks.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not considering the specific type of mask being used, as different masks may have varying effects on oxygen levels.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential benefits of wearing a mask, as it focuses solely on the negative effects without considering the protective role masks play in preventing the spread of diseases like COVID-19."}
