{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that was cut from school safety by stating it as $300 million, when the actual cut was closer to $200 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the cut in school safety funding could have prevented the Parkland shooting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of an armed police officer would have been sufficient to stop the Parkland shooter, without considering other factors and circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that previous presidents, including George W. Bush, also attempted to end the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, suggesting that the decision to cut funding was not solely made by the Obama administration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that while the formula-driven program was eliminated, Obama requested additional funding for a companion program that distributed grants on a case-by-case basis.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the range of activities and initiatives that were funded by the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, suggesting that it solely focused on armed guards or security measures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a simplified and potentially misleading representation of the complex budgetary decisions and programs related to school safety."}
