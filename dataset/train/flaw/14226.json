{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money Obama is spending on each illegal immigrant child by stating it as $18,972 per month.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the stated amount of money being spent on each illegal immigrant child.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount being spent on each illegal immigrant child is disproportionate to what American families earn, without providing any context or comparison to other government spending.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that all direct federal spending on minors, including American children, totals roughly $300 billion, which is significantly less than the claimed amount for each illegal immigrant child.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors not considered in the claim that could affect the cost of addressing the surge of children from Central America in 2014."}
