{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that re-opening Wuhan caused 1290 deaths on April 17, 2020.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in deaths was attributed to \"belated, missed and mistaken\" reporting during the peak of the pandemic, rather than solely due to the re-opening of the city.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of re-opening Wuhan by attributing a specific number of deaths solely to that action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between the re-opening of Wuhan and the reported increase in deaths, without considering other factors or variables that may have contributed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in deaths, such as the overwhelmed healthcare system and delayed reporting during the height of the pandemic."}
