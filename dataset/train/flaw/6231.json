{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the profits generated by student loans from the federal government between 2007 and 2012. The expert's verdict mentions that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected a loss instead of a profit when using different accounting methods.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to substantiate the $66 billion profit figure. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on one source, the Government Accountability Office, and that the CBO's projections contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the profits from student loans are solely due to interest rates charged by the government. The expert's verdict mentions that the system of student loans required billions of dollars in federal subsidies and produced revenue streams for banks before the direct loan system was implemented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the profits generated by student loans. The expert's verdict mentions that the government subsidies to banks were replaced with direct loans administered by the Department of Education, which could affect the profitability of the loans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CBO's projections show a loss instead of a profit when using different accounting methods.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as there is no specific evidence mentioned in the expert's verdict to support this bias.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential profits generated by student loans. The expert's verdict mentions that the government is forecast to generate billions in profits from student loans, but it does not provide a specific figure."}
