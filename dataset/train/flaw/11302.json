{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by James Comey about the ability to vet refugees. Comey did not say that he couldn't vet those refugees to make sure they weren't terrorists, but rather expressed the limitations of the vetting process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it misquotes James Comey and presents a distorted view of his statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that James Comey's statement about the limitations of the vetting process means that refugees cannot be vetted to ensure they are not terrorists, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that James Comey did not say he couldn't vet those refugees to make sure they weren't terrorists.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that Comey's statements were about the limitations of available data and not about the inability to vet refugees."}
