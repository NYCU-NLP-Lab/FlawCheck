{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that AT&T had a contract to conduct a forensic audit of Dominion Voting Systems in Nashville.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as both AT&T and Dominion have denied any involvement in an audit of Dominion voting machines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the explosion was intended to destroy the machines before they were audited, which is a problematic assumption without any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the person of interest in connection with the explosion had a different motive unrelated to the election.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the explosion and its potential impact on the audit process, if it were true."}
