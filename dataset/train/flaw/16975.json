{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden wants to tax 401(k)s and IRAs, when in reality, his plan only proposes changes to the tax deductions associated with these retirement accounts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific mention of 401(k) plans or IRAs in the Democratic Platform or on the Biden campaign website.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by assuming that the proposed changes to tax deductions for 401(k) plans and IRAs equate to taxing these retirement accounts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Page 78 of the Democratic Platform does not deal with retirement savings, but rather focuses on veterans, military, and transnational issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by experts that the proposed changes to tax deductions could be seen as a tax increase for higher income earners, but it does not apply to all individuals."}
