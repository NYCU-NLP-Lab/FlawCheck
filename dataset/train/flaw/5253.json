{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the achievement of giving priority to clean energy by stating that it accounts for over 75% of the installed capacity, compared to the world average of only 24%. This could be an overstatement of the extent of clean energy implementation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that clean energy accounts for over 75% of the installed capacity. Without further information, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving priority to clean energy is a positive action without acknowledging any potential drawbacks or challenges associated with this approach. It presents clean energy as the superior choice without considering alternative energy sources or potential trade-offs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher installed capacity of clean energy in comparison to the world average. Factors such as geographical location, natural resources, or government policies could contribute to this difference, but the claim does not address these possibilities."}
