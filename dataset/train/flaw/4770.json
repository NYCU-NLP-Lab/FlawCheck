{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the US patent (US2006257852) and the European patent (EP3172319B1) by implying that they are directly related to the novel coronavirus causing the current pandemic.", "Understate": "The claim understates the severity of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus by referring to it as a \"weak ass virus\" and downplaying its potential impact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the connection between the patents and the conspiracy theory of a \"big pharmaceutical play\" behind the emergency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the timing of the European patent being granted in November 2019 is suspicious and implies a deliberate plan, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the patents, such as the fact that they may be related to previous strains of coronaviruses or other research purposes unrelated to the current pandemic."}
