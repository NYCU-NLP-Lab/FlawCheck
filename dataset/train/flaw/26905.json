{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of hardworking Virginians who have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare. The expert's investigation found that there is no exact count on how many Virginians were affected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no concrete data or evidence provided to substantiate the claim that millions of hardworking Virginians have lost their health insurance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obamacare is solely responsible for causing millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the loss of insurance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that the number of Virginians who received notices that their insurance plans were ending is estimated to be around 850,000, which is significantly lower than the claim of \"millions.\" This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the loss of insurance, such as changes in insurance plans or coverage options."}
