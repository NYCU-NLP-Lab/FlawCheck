{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Newsom's winery remained open while other wineries and businesses were ordered to close their indoor operations. The expert's verdict clarifies that Napa County, where Newsom's winery is located, was not included in the indoor operations closures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between Newsom's personal business interests and the exemption of Napa County from closures. The expert's verdict mentions that it is not clear if Napa County was exempt due to the governor's business interests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Newsom's winery remained open in July 2020, but the expert's verdict states that it is not open currently due to December 2020 shutdown and stay-at-home orders. The claim also assumes that Newsom's winery was exempt from closures solely because of his personal business interests, which is not supported by sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents one explanation for the disparity in closures, suggesting that it was due to Newsom's personal business interests. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the closure decisions were based on public health metrics and factors such as hospitalizations, community transmissions, and hospital capacity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Newsom's winery is currently closed due to December 2020 shutdown and stay-at-home orders."}
