{"Exaggerate": "The claim of gas costing $4.50 a gallon is higher than the average price of gas at the time, which was $3.85 a gallon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is not backed up by concrete evidence or sources, and the only mention of it is from a spokesperson who mentioned a Dairy Mart in Lewisville, Texas charging that price, but it couldn't be verified.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the price of gas is uniform across the entire country, but it fails to consider regional variations and differences in gas prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the factors that contribute to gas prices, such as state regulations and blends of gas mandated by different states."}
