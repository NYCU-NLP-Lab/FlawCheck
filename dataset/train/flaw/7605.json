{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of minimum wage workers who are young adults or teenagers by stating that only one out of 10 minimum wage workers fall into this category. The expert's verdict suggests that this claim may not accurately represent the true proportion of young workers affected by minimum wage policies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that only one out of 10 minimum wage workers are young adults or teenagers. The expert's verdict mentions that the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data is incomplete, and the Congressional Budget Office report provides a significant caveat, indicating a lack of comprehensive evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of minimum wage workers are not young adults or teenagers. However, the expert's verdict points out that the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that workers aged 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the demographics of minimum wage workers. For example, the report mentions that workers in states with higher minimum wage levels are not accounted for in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data, and that vocational students may earn less than the minimum wage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented in the expert's verdict that workers aged 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage. This suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the demographics of minimum wage workers."}
