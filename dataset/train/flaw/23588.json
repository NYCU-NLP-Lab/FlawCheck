{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they have not been able to identify the original source of the video or the circumstances behind it, indicating a lack of support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows a frozen grape instantly crystallizing into a blob of ice around it. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the observed result would be no different than placing an ice cube in a supercooled glass of water, suggesting that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the phenomenon shown in the video, stating that the addition of an object like a grape to supercooled water would set off a chain reaction around the original impurity, triggering a transition from liquid to solid.", "Understate": "The claim does not provide any indication of the specific conditions required for the phenomenon to occur, such as the need for supercooled water and the presence of impurities. This could be considered an understatement of the complexity involved in achieving the described result.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any specific facts mentioned in the expert's verdict. However, it may be contradicting the fact that the observed result is not unique to a frozen grape but can be replicated with other impurities in supercooled water.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any specific aspect of the phenomenon or the video.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not provide enough information to determine if it falters at any specific points."}
