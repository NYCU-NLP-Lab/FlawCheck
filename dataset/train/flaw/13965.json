{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows the White House in near complete darkness during a protest on May 31, 2020 contradicts the fact that the image is actually from 2014 and was edited to appear darker.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by falsely stating that it is the first time in history that the White House lights went off during a protest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a manipulated image that is not from the actual protest on May 31, 2020.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the darkened lights at the White House during the protest were a deliberate action, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the darkened lights, such as the possibility that the lights are routinely turned off every night around that time.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by spreading misinformation and false information about the photo and its context.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
