{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by presenting a list of statistics on the leading causes of death in the United States through the first half of 2016, when such up-to-date information is not available.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the list of statistics accurately represents the leading causes of death in the United States in 2016, despite the fact that the figures are projections based on past trends.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a graphic that was widely circulated on Facebook, without providing additional credible sources or data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not record abortion as a cause of death, yet it is listed as the number one cause in the provided graphic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the list is primarily focused on medical maladies and does not involve intentional killing, which implies an alternative explanation for the ranking of causes of death."}
