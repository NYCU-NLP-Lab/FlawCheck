{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that US citizens married to immigrants are not eligible for stimulus checks, when in fact there are exceptions and conditions outlined in the CARES Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all US citizens married to immigrants are not eligible for stimulus checks, without considering the specific circumstances and exceptions mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that US citizens married to immigrants are universally ineligible for stimulus checks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why some US citizens married to immigrants may not be eligible for stimulus checks, such as filing taxes separately or not meeting certain criteria, but the claim does not consider these possibilities."}
