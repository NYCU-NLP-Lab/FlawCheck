{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the proposed education cut by stating it as 40 percent, while the expert's verdict states that returning to 2006 funding levels would mean a 42 percent spending reduction by 2021.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that Congressman Robert Hurt has a plan to cut education by 40 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a proposed bill by the Republican Study Committee, of which Congressman Hurt is a member, directly translates to his personal plan to cut education by 40 percent. This assumption is not explicitly supported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative reasons or motivations behind the proposed bill or the potential impact on education funding."}
