{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money Cory Booker has accepted from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career. The claim states that he has accepted over $400,000, but a more accurate number is around $350,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that accepting money from the pharmaceutical industry automatically means profiteering off the pain of people, without considering other possible reasons for accepting such donations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for accepting money from the pharmaceutical industry, such as campaign funding needs or support for healthcare policies.", "Understate": "The claim understates the amount of money Cory Booker has received from the pharmaceutical industry by only mentioning the amount donated directly to his campaign committee, without including the funds received through his leadership PAC.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cory Booker stated in 2017 that he had stopped taking industry donations, implying that he may not have accepted any money from the pharmaceutical industry since then.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing inconsistent numbers and not clearly explaining the breakdown of the donations from the pharmaceutical industry."}
