{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the rate at which elephants are killed for their ivory tusks. While the claim states that an elephant is killed every time someone drinks coffee, the expert's verdict clarifies that the rate is actually tens of thousands of elephants killed per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks every time someone drinks coffee.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between drinking coffee and the killing of elephants for their ivory tusks, without providing any evidence or logical explanation for this connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that recent reports suggest a decline in poaching, which challenges the claim and offers an alternative explanation for the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that recent reports indicate a decline in poaching, suggesting that the claim may not be accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual number of elephant deaths caused by poaching, as it only focuses on the time it takes to drink coffee and does not consider other factors or time intervals.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and well-supported argument, as it relies on a rhetorical flourish rather than factual evidence or research."}
