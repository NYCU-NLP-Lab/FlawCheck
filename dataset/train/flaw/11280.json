{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in the number of times the minimum wage has been raised during Democratic congresses versus Republican ones. It states that the minimum wage was raised \"21 times during Democratic congresses, and only twice during Republican ones,\" which implies a significant disparity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that minimum wage increases have been significantly more frequent during Democratic congresses. It does not provide specific examples or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of times the minimum wage has been raised is a direct reflection of the actions or priorities of each political party. It implies that the difference in the number of raises is solely due to the party affiliation of the congresses, without considering other factors such as economic conditions or political dynamics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the number of minimum wage raises. It does not explore other factors that could influence the decision-making process, such as the composition of Congress, public opinion, or external pressures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the number of times the minimum wage has been raised. While it states that the minimum wage has been raised \"23 times,\" there are differing opinions and interpretations on whether the initial establishment of the minimum wage in 1938 should be counted as a raise or not.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of times the minimum wage has been raised by stating it as \"23 times.\" According to the Congressional Research Service, the minimum wage has been raised 22 separate times through 10 separate amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the minimum wage has been raised more than twice during Republican congresses. The expert's analysis states that there have been three minimum wage increases voted on by Congress since 1980, with two of them occurring during Republican congresses."}
