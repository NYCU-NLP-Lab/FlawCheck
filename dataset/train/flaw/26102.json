{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential health problems caused by prolonged use of COVID-19-related face masks due to breathing in too much exhaled carbon dioxide. The expert's verdict suggests that only people with preexisting respiratory illnesses may face health issues with tight-fitting masks, but it does not fully acknowledge the potential risks for others.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that prolonged use of face masks causes health problems due to breathing in excessive carbon dioxide. However, the expert's verdict states that cloth or surgical masks do not pose a significant risk of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct link between prolonged mask usage and health problems caused by excessive carbon dioxide inhalation. The expert's verdict mentions that research articles and experts suggest that extreme symptoms are unlikely to occur in most people.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for potential health problems associated with prolonged mask usage. The expert's verdict mentions that people with preexisting respiratory illnesses may face breathing difficulties with certain types of tight-fitting masks, but it does not explore other factors that could contribute to health issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that cloth or surgical masks do not pose a significant risk of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the health problems caused by prolonged mask usage. The expert's verdict suggests that the risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia is unlikely to occur with cloth and surgical masks, and extreme symptoms are unlikely to occur in most people.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear distinction between different types of masks and their potential health effects. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim does not specify which masks cause the mentioned issues and whether it affects people with respiratory conditions more."}
