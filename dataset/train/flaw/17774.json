{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Hillary Clinton called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages, and improving financial oversight early on in the financial crisis. The expert's verdict suggests that Clinton did address these issues, but it is unclear if she did so as early as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages, and improving financial oversight early on in the financial crisis. This lack of supporting evidence makes the claim less reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages, and improving financial oversight were effective solutions to the financial crisis. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any analysis or evidence to support or challenge this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Hillary Clinton may have called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages, and improving financial oversight. The expert's verdict mentions Clinton's history with Wall Street and her ties to the finance industry, which could be alternative factors influencing her stance on these issues."}
