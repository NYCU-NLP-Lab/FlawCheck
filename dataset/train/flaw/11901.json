{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Alexander Vindman \"quit\" the Army \"after admitting he falsely testified at President Trump's impeachment inquiry.\" This is an exaggeration because Vindman retired from the Army due to a campaign of bullying and intimidation by Trump, not solely because of his testimony.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Vindman admitted to falsely testifying.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Vindman's retirement from the Army was directly linked to his testimony during the impeachment inquiry. The expert's verdict clarifies that Vindman retired due to a campaign of bullying and retaliation by Trump, not solely because of his testimony.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Vindman did not admit to falsely testifying during the impeachment inquiry. The expert's verdict explains that Vindman's testimony did not contain false statements, but that there was a discrepancy between his readout and the actual phone call.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Vindman's retirement, attributing it to Trump's campaign of bullying and intimidation rather than solely his testimony."}
