{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Scott's veto, as it implies that he vetoed funding for all 30 Florida rape crisis centers, when in reality he vetoed additional funding for these centers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Scott said the centers weren't needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Scott turned his back on every single woman who needed the rape crisis centers, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation given by Scott's spokesperson, who stated that the new funding would have been duplicative as the state already funded sexual violence programs."}
