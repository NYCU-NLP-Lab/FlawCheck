{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the risk of voter fraud associated with mail-in voting by using the word \"substantially\" without sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that mail-in voting systems increase the risk of voter fraud compared to in-person voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or data to back up the statement that mail-in voting systems substantially increase the risk of voter fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by comparing the risk of voter fraud between different types of ballot-casting systems without considering the overall minuscule occurrence of voter fraud in U.S. elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the push for expanded mail-in voting, such as public health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead focuses on alleged fraud without sufficient evidence."}
