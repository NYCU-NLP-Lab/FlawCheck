{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the pay gap between men and women by stating that women are paid \"77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.\" The expert explains that the 77 cent figure compares all male and female workers, regardless of their occupation, and that the pay gap is much smaller when looking at men and women working in the same professions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pay gap is solely due to gender discrimination, without considering other factors such as personal choice and occupational differences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that women are paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men. The expert explains that the statistic compares all male and female workers and does not specifically address the pay differences for the same occupations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the pay gap, such as occupational differences and personal choices made by individuals. The expert mentions that men and women are disproportionately represented in certain jobs, which can contribute to the overall earnings advantage for men."}
