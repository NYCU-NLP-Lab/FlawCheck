{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of special interest spending that was vetoed by Gov. Chris Christie. The claim states that $360 million was vetoed, but the expert's verdict states that only $86 million was actually vetoed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details to back up the statement about the budget being smaller than previous years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the budget signed by Gov. Christie is smaller than the budgets signed by his predecessor without providing any evidence or comparison.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the budget cuts made by Gov. Christie were not as deep as he claimed. The expert's verdict states that the cuts were smaller than what was stated in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have an alternative explanation as to why the budget is smaller than previous years, such as factors unrelated to Gov. Christie's actions. However, this alternative explanation is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
