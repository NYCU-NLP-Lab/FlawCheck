{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of votes that supposedly don't add up, stating that there were 300,000 more votes for congressional seats than for governor, when in reality the difference is only 37,027 votes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation of voter fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in votes between congressional candidates and the governor's race is indicative of voter fraud, without considering the possibility of split votes or other factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been no credible complaints of voter fraud in Orange County following the midterm elections.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by incorrectly calculating the vote totals and making false assumptions about voter fraud.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the shift in voting patterns, such as changing demographics or political preferences."}
