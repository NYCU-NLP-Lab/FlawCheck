{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the success of the government in achieving total rural electrification by stating that all villages have been electrified before the set target date. It may not consider the possibility of some villages still lacking access to electricity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that all villages have been electrified. It relies on the maps posted by Piyush Goyal, which may not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of the electrification status.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in brightness on the night maps from 2012 to 2016 is solely due to increased electrification of Indian villages. It may not consider other factors that could contribute to the change in brightness, such as changes in population density or urbanization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in brightness on the night maps, such as improvements in satellite imaging technology or changes in data processing methods. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and presents the increase as solely indicative of increased electrification."}
