{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to establish a direct connection between the image of the damaged road and Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh. The expert's verdict states that the image was first shared by Malaysia-centric Facebook pages in December 2019, indicating that it is unrelated to the recent cyclone.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of the damaged road is a result of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh. However, there is no evidence or confirmation provided to support this assumption. The expert's verdict suggests that the image is unrelated to the cyclone and was shared by Malaysian pages in 2019.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image is unrelated to Cyclone Amphan. The expert's verdict clearly states that the image was shared by Malaysian Facebook pages in December 2019, indicating that it predates the cyclone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the image, as it was first shared by Malaysian Facebook pages and not directly linked to Cyclone Amphan. This suggests that the image may be depicting a different event or location.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the image by attributing it solely to Cyclone Amphan. The expert's verdict suggests that the image has been circulating since 2019, indicating that it has been used in different contexts and may not accurately represent the impact of the cyclone.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim as it simply presents the image and questions whether the cyclone or poor construction is to blame. However, the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support this question.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication that the claim falters at times, as it is a straightforward presentation of an image and a question. However, the lack of evidence and the expert's verdict questioning the connection to Cyclone Amphan suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate or reliable."}
