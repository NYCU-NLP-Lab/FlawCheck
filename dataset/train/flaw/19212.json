{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the size and growth of the Cathedral of Christ the King by stating that it is one of the largest and fastest-growing parishes in the Archdiocese of Atlanta. The expert's verdict provides data that shows the cathedral's ranking in terms of size and growth within the archdiocese, which suggests that it may not be the largest or fastest-growing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the Cathedral of Christ the King is one of the largest and fastest-growing parishes. The expert's verdict provides specific numbers and rankings to evaluate the claim, indicating that more concrete evidence is needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being one of the largest and fastest-growing parishes is a positive attribute. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the cathedral is \"landlocked,\" which could imply that the growth may present challenges or limitations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory faced criticism and controversy regarding his residence, which could suggest that the claim about the cathedral's size and growth might have been made to divert attention or create a positive image.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights that the archbishop's statement about the cathedral's size and growth was deemed worthy of fact-checking due to the attention it received. This suggests that the claim may have inconsistencies or inaccuracies that need to be addressed.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict provides data from the Official Catholic Directory, which contradicts the claim's assertion that the Cathedral of Christ the King is one of the largest parishes. The data shows that there were two larger parishes in the archdiocese during specific years.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
