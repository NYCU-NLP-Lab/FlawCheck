{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the most recent growth number for the first quarter of 2018 was 2.0 percent, not 3.2 percent.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of reaching 3.2 percent growth, as it confuses a single quarter's growth with sustained growth over an entire year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that \"nobody thought\" 3.2 percent growth was possible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sustained 3 percent annual growth is possible, despite economists' reasoning and the lack of such growth in the past decade.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the growth numbers, such as normal variations in the economy and the impact of demographics and productivity."}
