{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Kapil Sibal said B R Ambedkar agreed with V D Savarkar on the two-nation theory. The OpIndia article and the tweet by Moneycontrol are the only sources mentioned, but no direct evidence or verifiable statements from Kapil Sibal are provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kapil Sibal made a statement about B R Ambedkar agreeing with V D Savarkar on the two-nation theory. However, there is no direct quote or clear confirmation of this statement from Kapil Sibal himself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "It is possible that Kapil Sibal's statement was misinterpreted or misquoted, as Alt News found that the Congress MP has been misquoted in the OpIndia article. This suggests that there might be an alternative explanation for the claim made by OpIndia."}
