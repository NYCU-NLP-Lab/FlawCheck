{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"about 3,000 murders\" in connection with lax border security is an exaggeration. The actual data provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety states that there were 3,070 homicides committed by criminal aliens over a period of several years, not specifically related to lax border security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a specific interpretation of the data provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. The data does not specifically attribute the homicides to lax border security but includes all criminal charges by criminal aliens.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all homicides mentioned in the data are directly related to lax border security, which is a problematic assumption. The data does not provide a clear link between the homicides and border security.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on the interpretation of the data by Greg Abbott and Rick Perry. The expert's verdict states that the claim aligns with a more specific Perry claim that was found to be factually unsupported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the homicides mentioned in the data, such as other factors contributing to crime rates, socio-economic issues, or other law enforcement challenges. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
