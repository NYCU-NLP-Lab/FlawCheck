{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in the value of the federal minimum wage between Reagan's time and the present. It states that the wage is worth about 20 percent less, while the expert's analysis shows it to be closer to 15.6 percent less.", "Understate": "The claim understates the difference in the value of the federal minimum wage between Reagan's time and the present. The expert's analysis shows that the wage is actually closer to 16 percent less, not the claimed 20 percent less.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for its assertion. It does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that the federal minimum wage is worth less than it was during Reagan's time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the value of the federal minimum wage is the only factor to consider when evaluating its worth. It does not take into account other economic factors or changes in the cost of living.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the value of the federal minimum wage between Reagan's time and the present. It solely attributes the difference to inflation, without considering other factors that may have influenced the wage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Reagan never oversaw a boost in the minimum wage. It implies that the wage was worth less during Reagan's time, despite the fact that it did not increase under his presidency."}
