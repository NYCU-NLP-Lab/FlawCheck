{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Jeffrey Epstein is still alive is an exaggeration, as there is no factual evidence to support this theory.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based solely on a news photo showing Epstein being wheeled into a hospital, which is not enough evidence to conclude that he is alive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a dead body would always be covered or in a body bag, which may not be the case in all situations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as the possibility that Epstein was still alive but later died.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the official statement from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which confirmed Epstein's death as an apparent suicide.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single photo as the basis for a conspiracy theory without considering other relevant information or evidence."}
