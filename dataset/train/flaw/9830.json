{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is only based on the reports from the New York Times and the Associated Press, which were in turn based on statements made by Steven Wagner. There may be a need for further evidence or investigation to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. government \"lost track\" of the immigrant children, implying negligence or incompetence. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the children were not necessarily missing or outside the care of their guardians, but rather their exact whereabouts could not be verified at the moment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why the U.S. government was unable to determine the whereabouts of some children placed with sponsors. It is possible that sponsors were unreachable or did not respond to attempts to verify the children's status."}
