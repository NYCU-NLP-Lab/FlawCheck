{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Donald Trump's criticism of President Obama during the 2013 government shutdown. The expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence of Trump's criticism, so it is difficult to determine the extent of the criticism.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's criticism of President Obama during the 2013 government shutdown was valid and justified. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis on whether Trump's criticism was accurate or fair.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that Donald Trump criticized President Obama during the 2013 government shutdown. The expert's verdict does not provide specific examples or quotes of Trump's criticism.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 2013 government shutdown occurred largely due to Republican attempts to tie government funding to resolutions delaying or defunding the Affordable Care Act. The claim implies that Trump criticized Obama for failing to lead, get everyone in a room, and make a deal, but it does not acknowledge the role of Republican actions in causing the shutdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the government shutdown or Trump's criticism of Obama. The expert's verdict provides additional context and explanations for the shutdown, including Republican attempts to defund the Affordable Care Act and the Democrats' stance on the DACA program."}
