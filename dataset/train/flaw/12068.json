{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against the Uyghur population as the result of \"different norms.\" However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Biden did not make such a statement and that his meaning was the opposite.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or specific quotes from President Biden to support the assertion that he dismissed or excused China's atrocities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Biden's reference to \"different norms\" was meant to excuse or dismiss China's atrocities, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict explains that Biden's comment was about the importance of speaking up for human rights and that he expected any U.S. president to take a position against human rights abuses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for President Biden's reference to \"different norms.\" The expert's verdict provides a different interpretation of Biden's comment, suggesting that it was about the need for a unified and tightly controlled China based on Xi Jinping's principles."}
