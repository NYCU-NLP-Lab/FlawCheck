{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the health risks of boiling water multiple times by stating that it will make the water dangerous to drink.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or support to back up the assertion that reboiled water is dangerous to drink.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that boiling water multiple times will result in the concentration of harmful chemicals, without considering the initial presence or levels of these chemicals in the water.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the concentration of harmful chemicals in water requires their presence in the water to begin with, rather than being formed solely through the process of boiling."}
