The expert mentions that the claim is not new or original and that important details are missing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that producing continual balanced budgets without raising taxes is a significant achievement, but the expert points out that it is a requirement for every governor in the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the governor's budget decisions, such as cutting tax credit programs, have had the same effect as tax increases, providing an alternative explanation to the claim that taxes have not been raised."}
