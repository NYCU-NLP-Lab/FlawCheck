{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs created in Madison and the Madison area, stating that 40,000 out of 60,000 new jobs were created there.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the civilian labor force, which is not a count of jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in jobs in the Madison area is solely due to public investment and not the state government or the university.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that other BLS figures show a larger increase in jobs than claimed by Soglin and that the Madison area does not account for two-thirds of the new jobs in Wisconsin.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in jobs in the Madison area, such as the growth of the state government or the university, which the claim dismisses."}
