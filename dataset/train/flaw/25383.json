{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of noncitizen voters in Florida by stating that nearly 200,000 voters may not be citizens, when in reality only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the voter rolls in 2012.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting outdated information that was published in 2012, which may no longer be accurate or relevant.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a six-year-old story and does not provide any recent or updated data to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the initial list of 180,000 names of potential noncitizen voters was accurate and reliable, when in fact it was found to contain errors and was later whittled down to a much smaller number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of noncitizens on the voter rolls, such as errors in the database or individuals who were legal residents at the time of voting but later became citizens."}
