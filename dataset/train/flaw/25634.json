{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the statement that Kenya and Ghana were the first countries to sign and ratify the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. It is unclear where this information comes from and if it is based on any official records or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that signing and ratifying the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement is a \"landmark\" achievement. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation, as different experts or individuals may have different opinions on the significance of this agreement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other countries may have also signed or ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement before Kenya and Ghana. Without a comprehensive analysis of all countries' actions, it is difficult to determine if Kenya and Ghana were truly the first countries to do so."}
