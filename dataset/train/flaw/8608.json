{"Understates": "The claim states that heroin and prescription opioids are the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin, but the expert's verdict indicates that the number of all drug overdose deaths in Wisconsin exceed the number of motor vehicle deaths and are the top cause of accidental deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that heroin and prescription opioids are the sole cause of accidental or preventable deaths in Wisconsin, without considering other factors or substances that may contribute to these deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that heroin and prescription opioids are the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict provides statistics on opioid deaths but does not specifically address the ranking of these deaths compared to other causes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the number of all drug overdose deaths, not just heroin and prescription opioid deaths, exceed the number of motor vehicle deaths and are the top cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that heroin and prescription opioids are the sole cause."}
