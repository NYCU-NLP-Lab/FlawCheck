{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement the anti-deportation measure. The expert's verdict states that Abbott's count of 22 is close to completely false.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama signed the anti-deportation measure into law and then claimed to have changed the law the next day. The expert's verdict states that Obama's exact wording was \"I just took an action to change the law\" and he made that comment five days after the administration's action was announced, not the next day.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to prove that Obama violated the Constitution and federal law by changing the law. The expert's verdict does not provide evidence or analysis to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's statement of \"I just changed the law\" proves that he violated the Constitution and federal law. The expert's verdict does not provide a clear analysis of whether this assumption is valid or not.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Obama's statement. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either."}
