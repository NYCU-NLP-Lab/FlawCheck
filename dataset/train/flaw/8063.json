{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Sharron Angle's stance on Social Security by suggesting that she wants to completely \"wipe out\" the program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Angle's statement about phasing out Medicare and Social Security means she wants to eliminate the programs entirely, without considering alternative interpretations or potential replacement plans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that Angle wants to eliminate Social Security, as it only provides a brief edited clip and news accounts that describe her stance without offering a detailed plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Angle's statement, such as the possibility that she may want to reform or privatize Social Security rather than completely eliminate it."}
