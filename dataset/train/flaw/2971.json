{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support Sanders received from young people of different ethnicities by stating that he received more votes than Trump and Clinton combined. It is unclear whether this claim is accurate due to a lack of specific data breakdown by race or ethnicity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to accurately determine whether Sanders received more support from minority youth compared to Trump and Clinton. The available data does not provide a breakdown of votes by race or ethnicity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that receiving more votes from young people automatically translates to receiving more votes from minority youth. However, the data provided does not specifically address the racial or ethnic composition of the young voters who supported Sanders.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Sanders receiving more votes from young people than Trump and Clinton combined. Factors such as campaign strategies, policy positions, and appeal to younger demographics could have influenced the voting patterns.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of providing a clear and consistent message. While Sanders initially stated that he received more votes from young people of all ages, he later clarified that it specifically applied to younger people of various ethnicities.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay the level of support Sanders received from young people or minority youth."}
