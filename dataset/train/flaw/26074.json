{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of President Trump's salary donations by stating that he donated his entire $400,000 annual salary, when in fact he donated his salary every quarter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to confirm that the donations were specifically for the purpose of rebuilding military cemeteries. The expert's verdict only mentions donations to various government departments for different projects, without specifying any donations for military cemeteries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the donations were solely for the purpose of rebuilding military cemeteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict. It is possible that the donations were used for other purposes as well.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the donations, such as fulfilling campaign promises or gaining positive publicity, which are not addressed in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
