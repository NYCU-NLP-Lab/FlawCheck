{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a 1997 study that looked at gun owners' responses to a 1994 national survey. The data is outdated and may not accurately reflect the current situation regarding background checks for gun sales.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 40 percent figure represents guns sold without background checks, but it includes transactions such as inheritance or gifting, which do not necessarily involve sales.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is debate and controversy surrounding the research conducted by Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig, suggesting that alternative explanations and interpretations of the data exist.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the percentage of guns purchased without background checks. When asked to boil down the 1994 data, one researcher mentioned a range of 14 to 22 percent, which is lower than the 40 percent figure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that federally licensed firearm dealers are required to conduct background checks before sales. The 40 percent figure refers to transactions that occur outside of these licensed dealerships.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which guns are sold without background checks by using the 40 percent figure, which includes non-sales transactions like inheritance or gifting.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and up-to-date statistic on the percentage of guns sold without background checks, as the data is from a 1994 survey and the estimates vary."}
