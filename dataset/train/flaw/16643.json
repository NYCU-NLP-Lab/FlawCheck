{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the wealth disparity by stating that the six wealthiest people have as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population. However, this bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a 2017 Oxfam report, which uses data from Forbes and Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Databook. However, it does not provide further evidence or analysis to support the claim, indicating a potential lack of enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wealth of the six wealthiest people is directly comparable to the wealth of the bottom half of the world's population. This assumption may be problematic as the distribution and nature of wealth differ significantly between these two groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The economist Emmanuel Saez mentioned in the expert's verdict suggests that the claim is technically correct but not meaningful because the bottom 50 percent essentially has no wealth. This alternative explanation challenges the significance and interpretation of the claim."}
