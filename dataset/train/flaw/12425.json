{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in K-12 education funding, stating it as a \"total increase of 4.1 percent\" when it is actually an increase of 0.613 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the source of the 4.1 percent figure is not provided and attempts to contact the governor's office for clarification have been unsuccessful.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the actual percentage increase in K-12 education funding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in total funding for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education automatically translates to increased funding for K-12 classrooms, without considering other factors or allocations within the budget.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in K-12 education funding, such as the inclusion of gaming funds and federal funds, which are not fully explained in the claim."}
