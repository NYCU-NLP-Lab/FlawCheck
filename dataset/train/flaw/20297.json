{"Understate": "The claim may understate the crime rate in Tallahassee by only focusing on a five-year low and not considering the higher crime rates in previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the five-year low in the crime rate, as it only provides data for two years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in crime rate is solely attributed to the actions of Mayor Gillum without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decrease.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in crime rate, such as changes in law enforcement strategies or demographic shifts, which are not addressed in the claim."}
