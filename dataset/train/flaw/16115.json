{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the gender wage gap in Ohio by stating that women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a smaller wage gap of 83.6 percent for Ohio.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites data from the National Partnership on Women and Families and the American Association of University Women, without providing additional sources or studies to back up the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The U.S. Department of Labor explains that the variations in pay gap assessments are due to differences in how each agency conducts its measurements, with the Census Bureau and women's groups looking at annual earnings while the BLS examines earnings on a weekly basis. This alternative explanation suggests that different measurement methods can lead to different pay gap percentages."}
