{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the study by stating that \"biological boys still maintain significant advantages over girls, including being 12% faster on the 1.5-mile run.\" The study actually found that transgender women ran 1.5 miles 12% faster than cisgender women on average, but the advantage diminished over time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details about the study, such as the sample size, methodology, or other relevant information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the study's findings on transgender women in the U.S. Air Force can be applied to transgender girls in school sports. However, the study was not about scholastic or collegiate athletes and focused on fitness test results among adults.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in performance between transgender women and cisgender women, such as factors like training, genetics, or other individual variations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the advantage of transgender women in terms of strength, based on push-ups and sit-ups, disappeared over time. This information was mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by cherry-picking the study's findings and misrepresenting its conclusions. It focuses only on the speed test and ignores other aspects of the study.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of hormone therapy on leveling the playing field for transgender women. The study's co-author mentioned that the advantage of transgender women continued to diminish the longer they were on testosterone blockers."}
