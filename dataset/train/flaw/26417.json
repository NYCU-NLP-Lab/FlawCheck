{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Trump's ban on welfare for illegal immigrants by stating that it will save $57.4 billion a year, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the $57.4 billion savings figure, as it does not specify the source or methodology behind this calculation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's ban on welfare for illegal immigrants will result in significant savings, without considering potential alternative costs or consequences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the $57.4 billion cost associated with immigrants, such as the fact that most of the cost is related to education expenses rather than federal benefits."}
