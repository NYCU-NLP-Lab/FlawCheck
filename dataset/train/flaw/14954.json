{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the US military, including National Guard members deputized on behalf of the US Marshals Service, was set to indict and detain a majority of Congress on January 25, 2021. There is no evidence or reputable reports to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no reputable reports or evidence to back up the assertion that the US military was planning to arrest Congress.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the US military and National Guard members were deputized by the US Marshals Service to arrest members of Congress. However, a US Marshals Service spokesman explicitly stated that no specially deputized National Guard members have executed any arrests in Washington, DC, and that the arrest of a member of Congress would fall outside the scope of their authority.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Congress continues to function normally and there have been no reputable reports of a mass arrest of legislators.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the claim is false and not supported by any reputable sources or evidence."}
