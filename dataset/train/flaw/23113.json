{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Catholic churches in Toronto were banned from carrying out the sacrament of Holy Communion. In reality, there were temporary restrictions placed on religious activities, including communion, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but these restrictions applied to all places of worship and were not specific to Catholic churches.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the restrictions on certain Catholic church rituals were an attack on religious freedom. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption, and it is based on rumors spread by right-wing media.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Catholic churches were specifically targeted or banned from carrying out Holy Communion. The expert's investigation found that similar restrictions applied to all places of worship and that Catholic churches had been gradually reopening with modified versions of communion since mid-June.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the temporary suspension of certain religious practices. The restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission and were not specifically aimed at targeting Catholic churches. Similar restrictions applied to other religious faiths as well.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the restrictions on Catholic church rituals were not a ban but temporary suspensions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The expert's investigation found that Catholic churches in Toronto had been closed since March and gradually began reopening in mid-June with modified versions of communion."}
