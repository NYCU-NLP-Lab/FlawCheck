{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of earmarks that George Allen voted for by stating it as 40,000, while the actual number is 52,319.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that George Allen voted for 40,000 earmarks. The source cited, Citizens Against Government Waste, provides a different number of earmarks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for earmarks automatically makes someone a big spender, without considering the context of the overall budget and spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider that earmarks were attached to major appropriations bills that Allen supported, and those bills authorized a much larger amount of discretionary spending."}
