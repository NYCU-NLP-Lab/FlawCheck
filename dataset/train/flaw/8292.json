{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of tax cuts made by David Dewhurst. The expert's verdict states that Dewhurst initially claimed to have made 63 tax cuts, but later amended the claim to 54 cuts.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion of 63 tax cuts. The backup information provided by Dewhurst's campaign only mentions 54 cuts and does not provide comprehensive details or evidence for the remaining cuts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tax cuts are a measure of success or effectiveness in governance. The expert's verdict highlights that despite the claimed tax cuts, Texans paid about the same level of taxes in 2010 as they did when Dewhurst took office, suggesting that the impact of the tax cuts may not have been significant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 2006 property tax reduction, touted as the largest in state history, was partly funded by tax increases. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the overall impact of the tax cuts.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim falters by initially stating 63 tax cuts and then amending it to 54 cuts. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the tax cuts by not providing comprehensive details or evidence for all the cuts claimed. The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the total savings or benefits generated by the tax cuts.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that, according to calculations by the non-partisan Tax Foundation, Texans paid about the same level of taxes in 2010 as they did when Dewhurst took office. This contradicts the claim of significant tax cuts made by Dewhurst."}
