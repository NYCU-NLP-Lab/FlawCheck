{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that cigarette butts \"poison babies and small children\" due to the nicotine in them, without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or studies to back up the assertion that cigarette butts poison babies and small children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of nicotine in cigarette butts automatically leads to poisoning in babies and small children, without considering factors such as ingestion or exposure levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the risks to children mentioned are related to the ingestion of discarded cigarette butts, rather than general exposure to nicotine.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the environmental problems posed by cigarette butts, as it focuses primarily on the potential harm to babies and small children, while neglecting the broader impact on wildlife and beach pollution.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that cigarette butts are the number one polluting litter on beaches, as stated by the expert. This suggests that the claim overlooks the environmental impact of cigarette butt pollution.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear distinction between the risks associated with ingestion of cigarette butts and general exposure to nicotine, potentially leading to confusion or misinterpretation."}
