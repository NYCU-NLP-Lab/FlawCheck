{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the cost of the federal health care overhaul to the Texas state government by stating it will cost \"upwards of $30 billion over the next 10 years.\" The actual estimate provided by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission was $27 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the estimated cost of $30 billion. It is not clear how this figure was determined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire cost of the federal health care overhaul will be borne by the Texas state government. It does not take into account the federal funding and cost-sharing arrangements that are part of the law.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the updated estimate of $27 billion provided by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. It relies on outdated information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may impact the cost estimate, such as changes in the implementation of the law or potential cost-saving measures."}
