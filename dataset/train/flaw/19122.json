{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in natural gas production between New York and Pennsylvania by stating that it plummeted by nearly 70 percent in New York and soared almost 1,000 percent in Pennsylvania. The actual decrease in New York was 68 percent and the increase in Pennsylvania was 854 percent.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the percentages mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in natural gas production between New York and Pennsylvania is solely due to New York's refusal to allow the construction of a pipeline. It does not consider other factors such as geological differences or the use of hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in natural gas production between New York and Pennsylvania, such as geological differences or the use of hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania."}
