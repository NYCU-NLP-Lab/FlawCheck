{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the injuries by stating that the protesters are wearing bandages over non-existent injuries. It is possible that the bandages are symbolic or worn in solidarity with someone who was injured.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or context to support the assertion that the injuries are non-existent. It is based solely on the appearance of the protesters wearing bandages.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protesters are wearing bandages to deceive or mislead, without considering alternative explanations or motivations for wearing bandages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photos have been shared in a misleading context, and the expert's verdict explains that the bandages were worn in solidarity with a student who lost an eye during a previous protest. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the injuries are non-existent."}
