{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of President Trump's election on job creation in Wisconsin. While the claim states that 36,000 jobs have been created since his election, the expert's verdict mentions that the number of jobs in Wisconsin actually rose by 40,900 during that period.", "Understate": "On the other hand, the expert's verdict suggests that the claim understates the change in job numbers. The expert mentions that the claim actually understates the increase in jobs by a bit, as the number of jobs in Wisconsin rose by 40,900, not just 36,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statement. While the expert's verdict mentions that the claim largely matches up with the latest jobs data, it does not provide any specific data or sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in jobs in Wisconsin is solely due to President Trump's election. However, the expert's verdict mentions that job numbers have been rising in Wisconsin since 2010, indicating that the increase in jobs may be part of a broader trend rather than solely attributable to President Trump.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the increase in jobs in Wisconsin, such as broader economic trends or factors unrelated to President Trump's policies. The expert mentions that experts say you can't give a president full credit or full blame for job gains or losses on their watch."}
