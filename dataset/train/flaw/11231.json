{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs created in Florida during Jeb Bush's tenure by stating that \"we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas.\" The actual number of net new jobs in Florida was 186,800 higher than in Texas.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that Florida created more jobs than Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job creation in Florida during Jeb Bush's eight years as governor was solely due to his policies and actions, without considering other factors that may have influenced job growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in job creation between Florida and Texas, such as different economic conditions or industries in the two states.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the job creation data and only focusing on the net new jobs created during Jeb Bush's tenure.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information."}
