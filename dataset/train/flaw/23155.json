{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that only three students graduated college ready, without providing context or acknowledging the number of students who did not take the SATs.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as an understatement because it does not account for the number of students who go on to college without reaching the SAT benchmark or without taking the SATs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides the number of students who reached the SAT benchmark out of those who took the exam, without considering other factors such as ACT scores or college admissions criteria.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that achieving the SAT benchmark is the sole indicator of college readiness, which may not be accurate or comprehensive.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the low number of students reaching the SAT benchmark, such as inadequate resources or educational opportunities in the Camden public school system."}
