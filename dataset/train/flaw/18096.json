{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the CDC changing mortality count rules by stating that the death toll was inflated by 1600%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a 25-page paper from an organization called \"An Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge\" as evidence, which may not provide sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC illegally changed mortality count rules, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The chief of mortality statistics at NCHS, Bob Anderson, provides an alternative explanation by stating that the new guidance is essentially the same as the old, and the only difference is that the new guidance focuses specifically on Covid-19."}
