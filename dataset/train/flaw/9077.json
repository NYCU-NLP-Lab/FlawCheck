{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of months of uninterrupted job creation under President George W. Bush. The expert's verdict states that the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months, which falls slightly short of being \"uninterrupted.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that \"revenues were at an all-time high in 2007.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that tax receipts in 2007 were the highest recorded since 1934, but it also mentions that this statistic neglects the size of the economy as a whole.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the economic performance under President George W. Bush was favorable compared to that under President Barack Obama. The expert's verdict mentions that job creation under Bush was the lowest average annual percentage increase compared to other post-World War II presidents prior to Obama.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the economic performance and job creation under President George W. Bush. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama's figures were worse than any of his postwar predecessors, indicating that there may be other factors influencing the economy."}
