{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of voters purged by stating that \"no less than 20,000 voters\" were purged, while the expert's verdict mentions that only \"some\" of the 20,000 were apparently in violation of a federal court order.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the 20,000 voters were purged in violation of a federal court order.

This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the voter purges in Indiana.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Indiana has not purged the 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in this case."}
