{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that 70 to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check. However, the evidence provided shows that the support among NRA members ranges from 72 percent to 52 percent, which is lower than the claimed range.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides two polls and their results to support the statement. While the polls show a majority of NRA members supporting background checks, the sample sizes and margins of error may not be sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on different polls with varying results. The support for background checks among NRA members ranges from 72 percent to 52 percent, indicating some inconsistency in the data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the support or lack thereof among NRA members. It does not explore other factors that may influence their stance on universal background checks."}
