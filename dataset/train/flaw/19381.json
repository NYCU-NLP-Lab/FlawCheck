{"Exaggerate": "The claim of creating \"5 million jobs over the last 30 months in the private sector alone\" is an exaggeration because it cherry-picks the start date and does not provide the full context of job creation during the entire presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the number of jobs created.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all job gains in the private sector can be solely attributed to the actions of the Obama administration, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for job growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert notes that presidents have a relatively modest impact on job numbers, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for job creation during the specified period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that job creation numbers can vary depending on the chosen start date and methodology used for calculation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual job creation numbers by starting the count from a later date and excluding the job losses from the first year of Obama's presidency.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively presenting job creation numbers that favor the Obama administration while ignoring other valid starting points or methodologies."}
