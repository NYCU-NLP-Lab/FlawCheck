{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Cobb County being one of the largest school systems that is debt-free. It is unclear how significant this is in the context of the overall education landscape.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Cobb County is one of the largest school systems that is debt-free. It only references a 2010 census education finance report, which may not be up-to-date or comprehensive enough.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being debt-free is a positive characteristic for a school system without providing any reasoning or evidence to support this assumption. It is possible that some level of debt may be necessary or advantageous for certain educational initiatives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Cobb County may be debt-free. It does not explore potential factors such as financial management strategies, local tax revenue, or other external factors that may contribute to the lack of debt.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation by not providing a clear definition of what constitutes a \"large\" school system. It also does not address any potential limitations or caveats to the debt-free status of Cobb County.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim. However, the lack of sufficient evidence or support raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
