{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of uncounted ballots in Puerto Rico by using it as an example to support the argument of letting the election process run its course.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct connection between uncounted ballots in Puerto Rico and the need to let the election process run its course.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the uncounted ballots in Puerto Rico are comparable to the situation in states with close margins in the U.S. presidential race, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Senator Cornyn's tweet, suggesting that he was not referring specifically to the U.S. presidential election but rather to the importance of counting all legally submitted ballots in general elections."}
