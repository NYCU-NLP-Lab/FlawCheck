{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not bacteria.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Italy \"discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium,\" which is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Italy went against the WHO's \"law\" against COVID-19 autopsies, which is not true as the WHO never outlawed autopsies of COVID-19 patients.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that COVID-19 is a bacterium.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation for Italy's decrease in COVID-19 cases, attributing it to a larger medical conspiracy rather than the nationwide lockdown."}
