{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Abele campaign provided an analysis of voting records and other evidence to back up the claim. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of this evidence, suggesting that there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that both sides have made Stone's ties to Walker a theme, and Abele is pointing it out in a negative sense. This suggests that the claim assumes that Stone being similar to Walker is a negative characteristic, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for their similarities, such as shared political ideologies and backgrounds."}
