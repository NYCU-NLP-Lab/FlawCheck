{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Sikhs were protesting against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Punjab in 2019. The provided video and information indicate that the protest was unrelated to the NRC.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of the protest is evidence of Sikhs protesting against the NRC, without considering alternative explanations or further verifying the context of the protest.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video and information suggest an alternative explanation for the protest, stating that it was in response to a Hindu nationalist party's proposals for a public gathering in Amritsar.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video has been circulating online since at least May 2016, well before the implementation of the NRC in Assam.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the video and the NRC by falsely associating the protest with the issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting the video and making inaccurate assumptions about the nature of the protest.", "Understate": "None apparent in the given information."}
