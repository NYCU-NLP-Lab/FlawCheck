{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of a recent hiatus in sea level rise, suggesting that it conflicts with the scientific consensus regarding global warming.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the scientific consensus by suggesting that the recent hiatus in sea level rise disproves global warming.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single chart and does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a short-term fall in sea level over the last two years is significant and contradicts the long-term trend of rising sea levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for short-term fluctuations in sea level and ignores the long-term drivers of sea level change."}
