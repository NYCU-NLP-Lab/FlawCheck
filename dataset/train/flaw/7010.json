{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it suggests that American, British, and Israeli intelligence agencies actively worked together to create the Islamic State, which is a significant and far-reaching accusation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the alleged collaboration between the intelligence agencies and the creation of the Islamic State. The expert's verdict mentions that the theory is based on conspiracy theories and lacks concrete proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Edward Snowden's leaked documents reveal the collaboration between the intelligence agencies and the creation of the Islamic State. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Islamic State is widely recognized as an offshoot of al-Qaida, indicating that there are alternative explanations for its origins and development. This suggests that the claim's assertion of collaboration between intelligence agencies may not be the only explanation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the widely accepted understanding that the Islamic State emerged as an offshoot of al-Qaida and that it was not deliberately created by intelligence agencies.", "Understate": "There is no clear indication of any biases that understate the claim in the provided expert's verdict."}
