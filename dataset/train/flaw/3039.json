{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in crime rates by stating specific percentage increases (11 percent for murder, 28 percent for robbery, 51 percent for rape) without providing context or comparing them to national averages.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct causal link between Catherine Cortez Masto's tenure as attorney general and the increase in crime rates. It only presents the raw crime numbers without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in crime rates during Cortez Masto's last term as attorney general is solely attributable to her actions and policies, without considering external factors or the broader context of crime trends in Nevada.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the increase in reported rape, such as the FBI's broadened definition of rape in 2012, which could have contributed to higher numbers without necessarily indicating an actual increase in incidents.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively focusing on specific crime categories (murder, robbery, rape) without providing a comprehensive analysis of overall crime trends during Cortez Masto's tenure. It fails to mention that total crime decreased over the eight-year period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that total crime decreased during Cortez Masto's time in office, as well as the decrease in most major reported crimes, except for rape.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential volatility and unreliability of year-to-year crime statistics, as mentioned by the director of UNLV's Center for Crime and Justice Policy. It fails to acknowledge the limitations of relying solely on these statistics to draw conclusions about crime trends."}
