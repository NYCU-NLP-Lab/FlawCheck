{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Ukraine \"got all\" of its U.S. security assistance \"long before schedule\" contradicts the fact that not all of the money was disbursed on time and there were still unobligated defense funds for Ukraine.", "Understate": "The claim understates the delay and freeze in security aid for Ukraine, which lasted about two months.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that Ukraine received all of its aid before schedule.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other European nations do not provide aid to Ukraine, which is a problematic assumption as these countries have contributed significant grants and loans to Ukraine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the alternative explanation that the delay in aid and the request for investigation into Joe Biden and his son were reasons for the impeachment of President Trump."}
