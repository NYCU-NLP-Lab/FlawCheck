{"Exaggerate": "The claim in the misleading post exaggerates the amount of waste imported into Thailand, stating that it is \"up to tens of thousands of tonnes monthly.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Thailand imports plastic scraps, not general waste, and provides the actual amount of used plastic imported over the past five years as 906,521 tonnes.", "Lack enough support": "The misleading post does not provide any evidence or sources to support its claim. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides information from the Thai customs department, the Director General of the Department of Industrial Works, and a local NGO to support the fact that Thailand only imports plastic scraps, not general waste.", "Problematic assumption": "The misleading post assumes that Thailand imports general waste, which is not supported by official information. The expert's verdict clarifies that Thailand has authorized the import of plastic scraps for use as raw materials.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The misleading post fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as the possibility that it was taken in a different country. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the photo was taken in Indonesia and published by AFP.", "Contradict fact": "The misleading post contradicts the fact that Thailand does not have an official import category for \"general waste.\" The expert's verdict confirms this information provided by the Thai customs department and the Director General of the Department of Industrial Works.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in this case.", "Falters at times": "The misleading post falters by using a photo taken in Indonesia to support its claim about waste import in Thailand. The expert's verdict points out this discrepancy and provides the correct context for the photo."}
