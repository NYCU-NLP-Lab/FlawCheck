{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which people who fail gun background checks are prosecuted. The expert's verdict states that \"almost none\" of these individuals are prosecuted, suggesting that the claim may be overstating the lack of prosecution.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"almost none\" of the individuals who fail gun background checks are prosecuted. The expert's verdict does not provide specific numbers or statistics regarding the prosecution of these individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of prosecution for individuals who fail gun background checks is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. The expert's verdict mentions the disagreement among Wisconsin's top elected leaders on expanding background checks, suggesting that the claim may be making an assumption about the importance of this issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why individuals who fail gun background checks may not be prosecuted. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Wisconsin Department of Justice conducts background checks on every person attempting to buy a handgun and not everyone passes. The claim implies that individuals who fail background checks are trying to illegally buy a weapon, but the fact contradicts this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the prosecution rates for individuals who fail gun background checks. The expert's verdict mentions the lack of specific numbers or statistics, suggesting that the claim may not fully address the issue."}
