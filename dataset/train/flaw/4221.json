{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of the Dream Act, stating that it would be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that passing the Dream Act would result in a significant number of additional family members indirectly benefiting from the bill, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the Dream Act would be the single biggest amnesty in US history.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts argue that the comparison to the 1986 law is skewed, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the claim's assertion."}
