{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in property taxes by stating that they are \"18% higher than when (Mark Sharpe) first took office.\" The actual increase is closer to 8% when using the correct base year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the 18% increase in property taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in property taxes is solely due to Mark Sharpe's tenure in office, without considering other factors such as changes in property values or economic conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in property taxes, such as changes in property values or adjustments in tax rates by other officials or governing bodies."}
