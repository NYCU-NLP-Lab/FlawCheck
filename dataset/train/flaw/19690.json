The expert's verdict explains that the claim is false and provides evidence from experts and existing mail-in voting practices in other states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters will result in substantial voter fraud. The expert's verdict states that voter fraud via mail-in ballots is rare, and the claim is unsupported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that mail-in voting has been successfully implemented in other states, including Republican-leaning Utah, without significant issues or fraud. The expert's verdict mentions that Republican Senator Mitt Romney praised mail-in voting in his state.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making false statements about California's mail-in voting process and the potential for fraud. The expert's verdict highlights the inaccuracies in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
