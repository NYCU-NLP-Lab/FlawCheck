{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of times President Obama came to Ohio to campaign against Kasich. The expert's verdict states that Obama actually visited Ohio just three times to directly campaign or raise money for Strickland.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or details to back up the statement that Obama campaigned against Kasich 12 times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's visits to Ohio were solely for the purpose of campaigning against Kasich, when in reality, many of the visits were for official White House business and to promote specific policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Obama's visits to Ohio were mainly for policy-related reasons and that he did not mention Kasich or the governor's race in his speeches during non-campaign visits."}
