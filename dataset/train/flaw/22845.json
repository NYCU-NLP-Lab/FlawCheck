{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the support for the Democratic health care reform bill by stating that \"almost 40 percent\" of those who oppose it actually do so because they don't think it goes far enough.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough supporting evidence to prove that \"almost 40 percent\" of those who oppose the bill actually do so because they don't think it goes far enough. The evidence provided is based on a single poll, and it is not clear if this poll is representative of the entire population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that those who don't think the bill goes far enough will not be unhappy when the health care reform is passed. This assumption may not hold true for all individuals who hold this viewpoint.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why people may oppose the Democratic health care reform bill, such as concerns about cost, government involvement, or the impact on private insurance."}
