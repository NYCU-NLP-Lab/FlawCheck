{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the Oxford University study by stating that women with big butts are smarter and healthier, while the actual study only suggested that gluteofemoral fat stores conferred more health benefits than visceral fat and examined waist-to-hip ratio, not specifically \"big butts.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific details or evidence from the study to back up its assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that women with big butts are generally smarter and healthier than women who don't have big butts, which is not supported by the available research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the findings of the Oxford University study, such as the distribution of fat in different body regions and its impact on health, rather than solely attributing it to \"big butts.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Oxford University study did not specifically focus on \"big butts\" but rather examined gluteofemoral fat stores and waist-to-hip ratio.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting the findings of the study as a definitive conclusion, while the actual research suggests associations and correlations rather than causation.", "Understate": "None of the biases selected in this list are applicable to understate."}
