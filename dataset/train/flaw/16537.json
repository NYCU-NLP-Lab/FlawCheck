{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of President Obama in shutting down the government to force Obamacare. The expert's verdict clarifies that the shutdown was a result of an impasse between President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders over funding for Trump's proposed wall at the southern border, not Obama's actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that President Obama shut down the government to force Obamacare. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the shutdown in 2013 was due to disagreements between the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-controlled Senate, with Republicans attempting to defund or delay aspects of the Affordable Care Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shutdown in 2013 was solely caused by President Obama's desire to force Obamacare. The expert's verdict highlights that the Affordable Care Act was already in place and its financing already approved, so the shutdown did not have a direct impact on its implementation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the shutdown in 2013, stating that it was a result of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over government spending and attempts to defund or delay aspects of the Affordable Care Act. This challenges the claim that Obama shut down the government solely to force Obamacare."}
