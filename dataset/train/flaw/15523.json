While there may be concerns about the accuracy of the reported numbers, the claim presents a direct contradiction without providing concrete evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and strong connection between the drop in cellphone subscribers and the underreporting of COVID-19 deaths.
