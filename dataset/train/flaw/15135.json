{"Contradict fact": "The claim made by Ken Cuccinelli that \"most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs\" contradicts the fact that full-time jobs have grown 10 times faster than part-time employment since Obamacare was signed into law.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Obamacare on part-time employment by not providing enough evidence to support the statement.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided by the Cuccinelli campaign, citing an article about the rise in temporary U.S. workers, does not sufficiently support the claim that the majority of new jobs have been part-time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in part-time jobs is solely due to Obamacare, without considering other factors such as the sluggish economy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that the surge in part-time jobs may also be attributed to the sluggish economy, not just Obamacare."}
