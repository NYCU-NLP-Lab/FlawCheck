{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Bill White is for gay marriage is supported by the fact that he voted against a ban on gay marriage in 2005. However, there is no additional evidence provided to further support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against a ban on gay marriage automatically means being in favor of gay marriage. However, Bill White's campaign argues that his vote was not a vote for gay marriage and that his position is the same as Barack Obama's, who supports civil unions but not same-sex marriage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Bill White's campaign, stating that his position is in line with Barack Obama's support for civil unions rather than same-sex marriage."}
