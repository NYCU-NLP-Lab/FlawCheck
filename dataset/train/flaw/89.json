{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it states that \"half the people\" in California want to leave, which may not be entirely accurate based on the evidence presented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to substantiate the statement that \"half the people\" in California want to leave. The surveys mentioned in the expert's verdict suggest that a significant portion of the population has considered moving due to high housing costs, but it does not specifically address the exact percentage mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the desire to leave California is solely based on high cost-of-living, but there may be other factors influencing people's decision to stay or leave the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the desire to leave California, such as job opportunities, lifestyle preferences, or personal circumstances, which are not addressed in the claim."}
