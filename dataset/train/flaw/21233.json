{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the data used to compare the number of ICU beds in Boone County and Orange County is incomplete and does not provide a complete count.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by comparing the number of ICU beds between two different counties without considering other factors such as proximity to hospitals and alternative healthcare resources.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of ICU beds in Orange County by not considering additional data from The Leapfrog Group, which lists UNC Medical Center as having 82 ICU beds, contradicting the Johns Hopkins data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decision to close the UNC campus, such as the number of positive COVID-19 cases and the overall safety concerns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that UNC had at least 177 positive cases of COVID-19 after its first week, while MU had 415 students identified after its first week, suggesting that the number of ICU beds alone may not be the sole determining factor for campus closures.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in the number of ICU beds by stating that Boone County has a factor of three more ICU beds compared to Orange County, without considering alternative data sources and methodologies."}
