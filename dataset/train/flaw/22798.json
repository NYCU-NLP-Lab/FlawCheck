{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not accurately represent the number of troops proposed by both McCain and Obama. McCain's plan called for 3,000 troops, but the claim states that he called for 6,000 troops. Obama's plan included sending 1,200 National Guard troops, but the claim states that he said he would send 524 troops.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the numbers mentioned for McCain and Obama's border security plans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the number of troops sent to the border is the sole indicator of commitment to border security. It assumes that a higher number of troops automatically means better border security, without considering other factors or strategies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the number of troops proposed by McCain and Obama. It does not explore the reasons behind their differing approaches to border security or the potential effectiveness of their proposed plans.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in the number of troops proposed by McCain and Obama. It states that McCain called for 3,000 troops while Obama said he would send 524, when in reality McCain's plan called for 3,000 and Obama sent 1,200 National Guard troops.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that McCain's plan actually called for 3,000 troops, not 6,000 as mentioned in the claim."}
