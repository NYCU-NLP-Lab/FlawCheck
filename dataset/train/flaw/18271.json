{"Understates": "The claim may understate Rubio's voting record by stating that he \"voted against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe.\" The expert's verdict highlights that Rubio did vote in favor of some gun bills following the Orlando shooting, including those related to the no-fly list.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the accusation that Rubio \"voted against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe.\" The expert's verdict mentions that Rubio voted for Republican versions of gun bills, which may have had different provisions and intentions compared to the Democratic versions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against certain gun bills means voting against keeping families safe. However, the expert's verdict highlights that Rubio supported legislation that aimed to protect Second Amendment rights while ensuring terrorism suspicions are adjudicated by a court.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rubio's voting decisions, such as differing views on gun rights and concerns about potential infringement on Second Amendment rights. The expert's verdict mentions Rubio's endorsement by the National Rifle Association, which suggests a possible alignment with their stance on gun control."}
