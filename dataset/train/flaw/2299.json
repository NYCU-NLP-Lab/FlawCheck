{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that undervoting, where voters mark their choice for one race but skip making selections in other races down the ballot, is a common phenomenon in every election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the 450,000 ballots miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden and no other candidate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the existence of ballots with only a mark for Joe Biden is indicative of fraud, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the phenomenon of ballots with only a mark for Joe Biden, such as undervoting or voter preference for Biden over other candidates in down-ballot races."}
