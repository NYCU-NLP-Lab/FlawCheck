{"Lack enough support": "The claim that one fart burns 67 calories is not supported by any scientific evidence or credible sources. The only source provided is a Facebook page called \"F A C T,\" which does not offer any evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that farting burns calories without considering factors such as the duration of the fart and the energy used. The claim does not provide any specific criteria or measurements for determining the calorie burn.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that farting does not require any significant muscle activity or exertion. The expert states that the only way to achieve a measurable figure in calories burned from farting is if one strains themselves to the limit, indicating that the claim is not accurate.", "Understate": "The expert mentions that there were responses to similar inquiries on ChaCha that suggested less than one calorie, not very many calories, and no calories burned during farting. This suggests that the claim of 67 calories burned may be an understatement.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that there is a lack of scientific research on the subject of calories burned during farting. This indicates that the claim may falter in terms of providing concrete evidence or reliable information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the only way to achieve a measurable figure in calories burned from farting is if one strains themselves to the limit. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for any potential calorie burn during farting, such as muscle exertion or physical effort."}
