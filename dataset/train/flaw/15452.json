{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the trade deficits, stating that they total more than $2 trillion, while the actual accumulated trade deficit is $1.97 trillion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trade deficits are solely due to NAFTA without considering other factors that may have contributed to them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the trade deficits, such as the impact of other trade agreements or global economic factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive description of the trade position, as it only considers goods and not goods and services.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the positive impacts of NAFTA, as it focuses on the negative aspects and does not acknowledge the increase in exports and job creation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the trade deficits are not exactly \"more than $2 trillion\" but rather $1.97 trillion."}
