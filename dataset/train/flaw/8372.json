{"Understates": "The claim is understated because it does not accurately represent the information presented in the expert's verdict. The claim states that the map shows the portions of the U.S. with the greatest incidence of human trafficking, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the map only represents the estimations of hospital employees regarding the five states with the most cases of human trafficking.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the map accurately shows the portions of the U.S. with the greatest incidence of human trafficking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that the map accurately represents the overall prevalence of human trafficking throughout the U.S. and identifies specific trafficking \"hotspots\" within states. However, the expert's verdict explains that the map was part of an exercise by one hospital's staff and does not chart specific locations or overall prevalence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the incidence of human trafficking in the identified states. The expert's verdict mentions factors such as population density, proximity to borders, and ease of access as potential reasons for the high number of cases in those states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the map does not chart the overall prevalence of human trafficking throughout the U.S. or identify specific trafficking \"hotspots\" within states, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make any exaggerated claims.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times or present inconsistent information."}
