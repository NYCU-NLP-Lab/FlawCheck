{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of deaths from swimming pools, stating that there are \"360,000 (deaths) a year from swimming pools,\" which is significantly higher than the actual number reported by the CDC.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of deaths from drowning by only focusing on swimming pool deaths, ignoring other locations such as natural water bodies and bathtubs where drownings can also occur.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for the statement that there are 360,000 deaths a year from swimming pools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the country is not shut down for deaths from swimming pools, it should not be shut down for deaths from other causes like the coronavirus. This assumption overlooks the differences in the nature of the diseases and their impacts on public health.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the need to shut down the country due to the coronavirus, such as the contagious and infectious nature of the virus compared to non-infectious causes of death like drowning."}
