{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the issue by stating that access to Bernie Sanders' websites is blocked at all U.S. military bases, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a Facebook post and a video as evidence, without further verification or corroborating sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the blocking of Bernie Sanders' websites on military bases is intentional and specific to his campaign, without considering alternative explanations or technical issues that may be causing the blockage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the blockage, such as general content filters applied by the Department of Defense for various reasons, as mentioned in a post by the U.S. Department of Defense.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing sufficient details or addressing credibility questions raised by commenters, which may impact the overall reliability of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that websites for candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump remained accessible via the same connections, suggesting a disparity in the blocking of websites. However, this may not necessarily be the case as there could be other reasons for the disparity.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any aspect of the issue."}
