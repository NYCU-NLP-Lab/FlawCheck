{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of taxpayer dollars paid to millionaire hedge fund managers. The expert's verdict states that the state pension fund paid about $70 million in fees, but it does not specify how much of that went specifically to hedge funds. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the direct payment to hedge fund managers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the accusation that Gina Raimondo \"paid 70 million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the fees were divided between management fees and performance fees, but it does not provide a breakdown of how much went to hedge funds specifically. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support to prove the direct payment to hedge fund managers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that paying fees to hedge fund managers is problematic or unwarranted. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Raimondo justifies the fees by stating that the pension fund's portfolio is more diversified and less exposed to risk. Therefore, the claim makes a problematic assumption that paying fees to hedge fund managers is inherently wrong.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation for the payment of fees to hedge fund managers. The expert's verdict mentions that the state invests only a small portion of the pension money in hedge funds, and that investments are divided between various areas. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for the payment of fees to hedge fund managers, such as diversification and risk management.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the investment decisions and the rationale behind paying fees to hedge fund managers. The expert's verdict mentions the controversy surrounding the decision to increase investments in hedge funds and the justification provided by Raimondo. The claim, however, simplifies the situation by stating that Raimondo \"paid 70 million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers,\" which may not fully capture the nuances of the issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing accurate information. The expert's verdict mentions that the ad cites a Providence Journal story as the source of the claim, but the specific story referenced could not be found. This raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the information presented in the claim."}
