{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Trump's budget proposal by stating that it \"threatened to cut $2 trillion\" from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it proposed about $2 trillion in savings over 10 years.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Trump's budget proposal by not fully acknowledging the $2 trillion in savings that it proposed from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the $2 trillion figure, as the expert's verdict mentions that the net savings between all of Trump's budget proposals affecting Medicaid and Obamacare was projected to be about $765 billion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's budget proposal would have directly led to $2 trillion in cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, without considering potential alternative measures or reallocations of funds.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the majority of the savings would come from Medicaid, specifically from a rollback of the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and the redirection of funds to block grants for states."}
