{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kasich had \"the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat.\" While he did finish last in the spending changes subcategory, it does not necessarily mean he had the worst rating overall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one report by the Cato Institute to make its argument. It would be more comprehensive to consider other sources and evaluations of Kasich's spending record.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kasich's decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio is the sole reason for his low rating on spending. It overlooks other factors that may have contributed to the rating, such as economic conditions or other policy decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Kasich's low rating on spending. It does not explore other potential factors that may have influenced the outcome, such as the state's budget constraints or specific spending priorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kasich did not have the worst rating overall, as there were 12 Democrats who scored lower than him in the Cato Institute's report. This undermines the claim's credibility and accuracy.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by focusing on one subcategory of the overall scorecard and not providing a comprehensive analysis of Kasich's spending record. It may overlook other aspects of his fiscal policies that could impact the overall assessment."}
