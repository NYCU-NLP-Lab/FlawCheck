{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that Chinese nationals are not allowed inside supermarkets in Australia, when the video actually shows a couple being confronted in a specific incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident shown in the video represents a widespread policy of not allowing Chinese nationals inside supermarkets, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Chinese nationals are generally not allowed inside supermarkets in Australia, as the incident shown in the video is an isolated incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the incident shown in the video, as it was reported that the couple was confronted due to suspicion of hoarding baby formula, not because they were Chinese nationals.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a misleading narrative based on the video without considering other factors or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that major retailers in Australia have a policy of limiting the purchase of baby formula to deter hoarding and prevent its shipment overseas."}
