{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by referring to Planned Parenthood as an \"abortion business,\" which is an oversimplification of the services they provide.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Tony Evers wants to force residents to fund Planned Parenthood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that funding Planned Parenthood is equivalent to funding abortion services, without considering the other healthcare services they provide.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative reasons for Gov. Tony Evers' support for funding Planned Parenthood, such as promoting women's health or access to reproductive healthcare, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
