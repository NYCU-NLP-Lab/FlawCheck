{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the connection between the man rubbing cash on his face and nose and the police beating him up. The expert's verdict suggests that the two videos were juxtaposed to create a false narrative.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the direct causation between the man's actions and the police beating him up. The expert's verdict highlights that the videos were manipulated and there is no clear link between the two incidents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man rubbing cash on his face and nose was indirectly threatening to spread the infection, which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the man's injuries, such as being arrested and tortured by the police. This indicates that there could be other factors contributing to the man's condition, rather than just the act of rubbing cash on his face and nose."}
