{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Emma Gonzalez bullied the school shooter and blamed \"white boys' entitlement\" as the cause of all school shootings. This is proven false by the evidence provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions and views of Emma Gonzalez by falsely stating that she bullied the shooter and made extreme generalizations about the cause of all school shootings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided to back up the allegations of bullying or the claim that Gonzalez blamed \"white boys' entitlement\" for all school shootings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that Gonzalez's actions and statements are responsible for the school shooting, without any evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Gonzalez's statements, such as her response to President Trump's tweet and her focus on the shooter's mental health issues rather than bullying."}
