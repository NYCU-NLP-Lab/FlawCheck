{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decrease in deaths from COVID-19, stating that it is \"tenfold\" when data shows a decline between threefold and fourfold.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that deaths have been cut down to a level that is \"tenfold\" lower.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that news organizations are intentionally not reporting on the decrease in deaths and only focusing on cases, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the increase in reported cases being highlighted by news organizations, which is the concern about the rising number of infections and potential impact on public health."}
