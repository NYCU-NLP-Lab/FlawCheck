{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the length of time it took President Obama to call the attack in Libya \"terror\" by stating that it was two weeks, while the expert's verdict indicates that he referred to it as an act of terror the day after the attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama waited two weeks to call the attack in Libya \"terror,\" without considering the immediate response he made in the Rose Garden the day after the attack.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that President Obama waited two weeks to call the attack in Libya \"terror,\" as the expert's verdict provides evidence that he referred to it as an act of terror the day after the attack.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that President Obama did refer to the attack as an act of terror the day after, but it was misinterpreted or misunderstood by some individuals.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama did refer to the attack as an act of terror the day after, as supported by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the immediate response made by President Obama in the Rose Garden, which contradicts the assertion that he waited two weeks.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of President Obama's immediate response in the Rose Garden by not giving it enough emphasis or recognition."}
