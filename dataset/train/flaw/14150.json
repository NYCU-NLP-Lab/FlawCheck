{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as statistics on the average age of children entering prostitution vary and are based on limited studies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters as it relies on sources that may not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of the average age of children entering the commercial sex trade.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the average age of children entering prostitution, as factors such as gender, location, and individual circumstances can influence this age range.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the average age of children entering prostitution, as some studies suggest that the age range could be even younger than 11-14 years old.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average age of children entering the commercial sex trade is between 11 and 14 years old without considering the potential variations and complexities of the issue.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the average age of children entering prostitution.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts but is based on varying and limited studies, leading to uncertainty and potential contradictions in the available data."}
