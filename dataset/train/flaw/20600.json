{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that 80 percent of those who file for asylum are not qualified for it, without providing sufficient evidence to support this high percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that 80 percent of asylum claims are without merit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of asylum applications are not merited, without considering alternative reasons for denial or factors that may influence the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts point out that there are several other reasons why an asylum claim may not be granted, suggesting that the claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions' statement that adults are only being arrested because they didn't come through a port of entry is contradicted by the fact that immigrants can apply for asylum even if apprehended at the border.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement because it simplifies a complex issue by attributing the denial of asylum claims solely to lack of merit, without considering other factors that may contribute to the decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on generalizations and lacks specific evidence or data to support its assertion."}
