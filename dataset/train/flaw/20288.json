{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of annual gun purchases in Rhode Island. The campaign manager argues that the claim of approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases is a conservative estimate based on NICS Firearm Background Checks data, which showed higher figures in recent years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on NICS Firearm Background Checks data, which may not accurately represent the actual number of guns sold. The FBI and ATF do not collect information on the number of guns sold, and the NICS checks only represent the number of background checks conducted, not the number of firearms purchased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of NICS Firearm Background Checks conducted is equivalent to the number of guns sold. However, it is possible for multiple guns to be purchased with a single background check, which would make the claim of 20,000 annual gun purchases an inaccurate estimate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the NICS Firearm Background Checks data and the actual number of guns sold. The claim does not consider other factors that could affect the number of guns purchased in Rhode Island, such as private sales or transfers that do not require background checks."}
