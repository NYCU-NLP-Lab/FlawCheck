{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the new banknotes lack a EURion constellation, making it easier to copy and create counterfeit notes. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the banknotes incorporate modern anti-counterfeiting technology, which suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the potential for counterfeiting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or references to support the assertion that the absence of the EURion constellation makes it easier to copy the banknotes. It relies on anecdotal information and personal opinions rather than concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the EURion constellation on the new banknotes automatically makes them more susceptible to counterfeiting. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the banknotes incorporate other anti-counterfeit features, suggesting that the absence of the EURion constellation may not necessarily compromise their security.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the new banknotes incorporate modern anti-counterfeiting technology, which implies that there may be alternative explanations for the absence of the EURion constellation. It is possible that the banknotes utilize other security measures that render the EURion constellation unnecessary.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the new banknotes incorporate modern anti-counterfeiting technology, as stated by the expert's verdict. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication in the provided information that the claim understates any aspect related to the absence of the EURion constellation or counterfeiting concerns."}
