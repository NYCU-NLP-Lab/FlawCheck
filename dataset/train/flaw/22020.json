{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the severity of the punishment for violating Thanksgiving gathering restrictions, as it states that residents can be fined or jailed for having more than six people at a Thanksgiving dinner. However, the actual punishment mentioned by the expert is a fine, jail time, or both.", "Understate": "There does not seem to be any significant understatement in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement about crack cocaine possession being legal in Oregon. The expert's verdict clarifies that possessing cocaine and other controlled substances remains a violation of Oregon law, although there are changes in penalties for low-level possession coming into effect in February 2021.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that crack cocaine possession is legal in Oregon without providing sufficient evidence or context. This assumption is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which explains that drug possession, including cocaine, is still a violation of Oregon law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation presented in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that crack cocaine possession is illegal in Oregon, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any specific point."}
