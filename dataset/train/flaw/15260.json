{"Lack enough support": "The claim that having Friday classes is effective in reducing drinking on college campuses is supported by a study conducted at the University of Missouri, which found a relationship between the amount of drinking on Thursday evenings and whether students had early morning Friday classes. However, this study alone may not provide enough support to conclude that Friday classes are consistently effective in reducing drinking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for reduced drinking among students with Friday classes is solely due to the fact that they have early morning classes the next day. This assumption may overlook other potential factors that could influence drinking behavior, such as academic aptitude, major, or other student characteristics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the study mentioned in the claim suggests a relationship between Friday classes and reduced drinking on Thursdays, there could be alternative explanations for this correlation. The study's authors found no evidence of other factors influencing the observed Friday class effect, but there may still be other variables that were not considered.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential effectiveness of having Friday classes in reducing drinking on college campuses. The study found that students without Friday classes drank approximately twice as much on Thursdays compared to students with early Friday classes. This suggests that having Friday classes may have a significant impact on reducing drinking.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and consistent explanation for the relationship between Friday classes and reduced drinking. While the study supports the claim, there are also mentions of alternative explanations and uncertainties about the exact reasons behind the observed effect."}
