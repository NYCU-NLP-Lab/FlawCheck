{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of President Trump's decision on Boeing jobs by stating that the effect on jobs would be \"minimal\" or non-existent, according to a spokesman for Boeing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a statement made by Boeing in 2017 about the potential job support from the Iran Air deal, but it does not provide any recent or specific evidence to support the claim of 100,000 job losses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reversal of the Iran nuclear deal will directly result in the loss of 100,000 Boeing jobs, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations, such as the possibility of Boeing profiting from an Iran fallout or increased demand for defense contractors in the Middle East, which suggests that the claim may not be the only possible outcome of the policy reversal."}
