{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Aquafina bottled water doesn't freeze lacks sufficient evidence to support it. The provided YouTube video and anecdotal claims on internet forums do not provide substantial proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inability of Aquafina bottled water to freeze is due to nefarious chemicals or hidden ingredients. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or scientific reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert presents an alternative explanation to the claim, suggesting that the phenomenon of supercooled liquid could be responsible for Aquafina bottled water remaining in a liquid state below freezing. However, this explanation is deemed unlikely due to the presence of opened bottles that may contain contaminants necessary for ice crystal formation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that supercooled liquid can exist in pure, undisturbed substances below the freezing point of water. The expert explains that Aquafina, being heavily filtered, could potentially remain liquid below freezing if unopened and undisturbed.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the idea that Aquafina bottled water doesn't freeze by using strong innuendo and conspiracy-focused language in the presentation of anecdotal evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on anecdotal evidence and a YouTube video that does not provide substantial support for the assertion."}
