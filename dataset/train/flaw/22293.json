The only evidence provided is his lack of social media use.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Braverman's absence, such as his resignation from the Clinton Foundation and his new position with the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Foundation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Eric Braverman is not missing but has taken on a new role with a different organization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Braverman's absence is suspicious and implies that he may be in danger or hiding, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption."}
