{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential increase in roadway deaths and impaired driving as a result of legalizing cannabis, as it assumes that the experiences in Colorado and Washington will be the same in Vermont.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that roadway deaths and impaired driving will increase if Vermont legalizes a market for cannabis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the experiences in Colorado and Washington will directly translate to Vermont without considering potential differences in demographics, enforcement, or other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in impaired driving and roadway fatalities in Colorado and Washington, such as increased population or changes in law enforcement practices, that are not solely attributed to the legalization of cannabis.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists, making it difficult to determine the influence of cannabis on impaired driving and roadway deaths.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by solely attributing the potential increase in impaired driving and roadway deaths to the legalization of cannabis, without considering other contributing factors."}
