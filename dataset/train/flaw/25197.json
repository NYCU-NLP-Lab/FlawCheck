{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the involvement of Kapil Sibal, Indira Jaising, and Dushyant Dave in receiving money from PFI during the Anti-CAA protests. The evidence provided only mentions the alleged transfer of funds to their bank accounts without providing further details or conclusive evidence of their involvement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to conclusively prove that Kapil Sibal, Indira Jaising, and Dushyant Dave received money from PFI during the Anti-CAA protests. The evidence provided is based on allegations and reports, but there is no concrete evidence or official confirmation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between the alleged bank transfers and the Anti-CAA protests, suggesting that the funds were used to fund the protests. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence or a clear causal relationship between the transfers and the protests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the alleged bank transfers, such as legitimate legal fees or other unrelated transactions. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations, presenting the alleged transfers as evidence of wrongdoing without sufficient context or investigation."}
