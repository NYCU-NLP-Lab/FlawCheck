{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that the transportation budget and Ohio Turnpike plan will result in lower tolls than ever before in the history of the turnpike.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that tolls will be lower than ever before.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its accuracy and consistency, as it contradicts the fact that tolls are actually set to increase for at least 10 years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the plan calls for tolls to increase for a significant period of time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transportation budget and Ohio Turnpike plan will automatically result in lower tolls, without considering other factors or potential alternative explanations."}
