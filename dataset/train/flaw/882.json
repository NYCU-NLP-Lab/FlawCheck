{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Rudy Giuliani has been disbarred for his role in inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The expert's verdict clarifies that Giuliani's law license was suspended, not disbarred.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Giuliani was disbarred for his role in inciting the attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Giuliani's role in inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol was the sole reason for his disbarment. The expert's verdict explains that the reasons for Giuliani's suspension were not precisely the same as those claimed in the rumor addressed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Giuliani was suspended, not disbarred, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the situation regarding Giuliani's disbarment or suspension.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Giuliani's suspension, such as other complaints or actions that may have contributed to the decision."}
