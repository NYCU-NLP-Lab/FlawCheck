{"Lack enough support": "The claim of 50 foreign nationals from Iran and Italy coming to a mosque in Patna's Kurji lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing people coming out of a building is evidence of 50 foreign nationals hiding in a mosque, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of foreign nationals arrested, as other media outlets reported only 12 arrests compared to the initial claim of 50.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by other media outlets, which reported a lower number of arrests.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by suggesting that the foreign nationals were hiding and causing panic in the colony.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the presence of the foreign nationals, such as travel or work-related reasons, which are not explored in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and consistent account of the number and actions of the foreign nationals, as different sources present conflicting information."}
