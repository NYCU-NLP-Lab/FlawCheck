{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Clintons posed with Yasser Arafat. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the photograph is misleading and cropped to imply a different scenario.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph shows the Clintons posing with Yasser Arafat, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that it was taken during a gathering of world leaders in Morocco, where the Clintons were jointly posing with Turkish president Suleyman Demirel.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the photograph by suggesting that it has implications for Jewish voters and their support for Hillary Clinton, without providing concrete evidence to support this connection.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the photograph and the context in which it was taken. The expert's verdict highlights the misleading nature of the image and the legend associated with it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Yasser Arafat was involved in peace negotiations with President Bill Clinton and Israeli leaders, and even shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. This contradicts the implication that the photograph suggests a negative association between the Clintons and Arafat.", "Understate": "It is unclear if any specific bias of understating exists in the provided claim."}
