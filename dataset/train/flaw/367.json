{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered to have an element of exaggeration as it states that Missouri State is last among Missouri schools in per capita state fiscal support for higher education. While it is true that Missouri State ranks low in funding, it may not necessarily be last among all Missouri schools.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by data from the Missouri Budget Project's annual report, which uses information from Grapevine. However, the claim could benefit from additional supporting evidence or data to strengthen its validity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that per capita state fiscal support for higher education is the sole determining factor in ranking Missouri State among other schools. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to the ranking, such as private funding or endowments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the ranking of Missouri State among Missouri schools. It focuses solely on per capita state fiscal support without considering other factors that may affect funding levels."}
