{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a single survey conducted by the Economist and YouGov, which may not accurately represent the views of all Donald Trump voters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that support from 10% or more of Donald Trump voters in a single survey translates to broader cross-partisan appeal, which may not be the case.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Yang's support among Trump voters has consistently been lower in subsequent polls, with his most recent support being zero.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Yang's cross-partisan appeal by stating that he is one of only two candidates with 10% or more support among Trump voters, when in reality, there are eight candidates who achieved that level of support.", "Understate": "No understated biases are evident in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying solely on one survey to make a broad claim about Yang's cross-partisan appeal, without considering the consistency of his support in subsequent polls.", "Exist alternative explanation": "No alternative explanations are evident in the provided claim."}
