{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because a government shutdown does not completely shut down the military. The expert's verdict clarifies that the term \"shutting down our military\" is not used literally by Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that a government shutdown shuts down the military.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a government shutdown directly affects the military, without considering the specific implications and exemptions that exist during a shutdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that a government shutdown occurs due to an impasse between Congress and the president, and it is not solely the Democrats' fault, as implied in the claim."}
