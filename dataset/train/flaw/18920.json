Bush by referring to it as \"one of her most memorable quotes.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Margaret Thatcher was meant to portray George H.W. Bush as weak-spined, without providing sufficient evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that there are different accounts and recollections of when and how the statement was made, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or sources to support the assertion that the statement is an \"old wives' story\" as described by Dick Cheney.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the accounts given by both George H.W. Bush and Margaret Thatcher, who both confirm that the statement was made."}
