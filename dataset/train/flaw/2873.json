{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Roy Cooper and Josh Stein have imposed a de-facto moratorium on capital punishment. While there hasn't been an execution since 2006, it is unclear if this is solely due to the actions of Cooper and Stein.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the legal challenges and court rulings surrounding the death penalty in North Carolina. It suggests that Cooper and Stein are solely responsible for the moratorium, but there are multiple factors at play.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Cooper and Stein have imposed a de-facto moratorium on capital punishment. It relies on statements from Berger and Moore, but additional evidence is needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cooper and Stein are death penalty opponents and are intentionally using legal tactics to block executions. However, their actual stance on the death penalty and their intentions are not clearly stated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lack of executions in North Carolina, such as the ongoing legal challenges and court rulings. The claim does not consider other factors that could contribute to the moratorium."}
