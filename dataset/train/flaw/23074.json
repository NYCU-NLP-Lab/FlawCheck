{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of absentee votes with missing addresses by stating \"tens of thousands\" when the actual issue is with missing address information from witnesses.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has a guidance in place since October 2016 that allows election clerks to fill in missing address information from outside sources.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the change in policy was made after the fact due to the pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the change in policy was made to accommodate people who forgot their address due to the pandemic, when in fact the issue is with missing witness address information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the change in policy, such as the existing guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission and the dismissal of a Trump campaign lawsuit based on the witness address policy."}
