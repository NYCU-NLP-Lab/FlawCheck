{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the complexity of the government's regulation of salmon by stating that the Interior Department handles them in fresh water and the Commerce Department handles them in saltwater. The expert's verdict suggests that this may even be an underselling of the complexity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement about the division of responsibilities between the Interior Department and the Commerce Department.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the division of responsibilities between the Interior Department and the Commerce Department for salmon regulation is inefficient or outdated. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is a more complex network of agencies involved in the regulation of salmon, including the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This alternative explanation challenges the simplicity of the claim."}
