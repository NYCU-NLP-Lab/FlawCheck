{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that voter fraud played a significant role in the margin of victory for John Lehman, which may be an exaggeration since no specific examples or evidence are provided to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any instances of election-related issues, such as election registration documents found in a dumpster or complaints by a poll worker, automatically constitute voter fraud. However, these issues may have alternative explanations and may not necessarily be indicative of intentional fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that voter fraud contributed to the margin of victory for John Lehman.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the margin of victory, such as voter turnout, campaign strategies, or other factors that may have influenced the election outcome.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its argumentation by stating that \"a portion\" of the vote was fraud without providing clear evidence or defining what constitutes fraud in this context.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of factors other than voter fraud on the margin of victory, such as voter preferences or campaign efforts."}
