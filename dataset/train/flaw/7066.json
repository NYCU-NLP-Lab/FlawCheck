{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support for fair maps by stating that \"jurisdictions representing about 80% of WI residents have passed referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that 55 counties in Wisconsin have either held referendum votes or have had resolutions approved, representing nearly 83% of Wisconsin residents. While this is a significant level of support, it is not exactly 80%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"jurisdictions representing about 80% of WI residents have passed referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps.\" The expert's verdict mentions the support from 55 counties, but it does not provide additional information or evidence to confirm the claim's assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that passing referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps equates to achieving fair maps. It does not address potential challenges or limitations in implementing fair maps even if they are supported by a majority of jurisdictions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the support of fair maps, such as political motivations or partisan interests. The expert's verdict mentions that the political landscape has changed with a Democrat holding the governor's office, which could influence the support for fair maps.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the current situation regarding fair maps in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict provides additional context and information about the history of redistricting, lawsuits, and the actions taken by the current governor, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
