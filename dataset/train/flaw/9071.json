{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the DTaP shot is the most likely triggering cause of microcephaly without sufficient evidence or scientific consensus.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to establish a direct causal link between the DTaP shot and microcephaly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the occurrence of microcephaly, such as the Zika virus, which has been widely studied and linked to the birth defect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the vaccine distributed in Brazil was actually Tdap, not DTaP.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of the DTaP shot as the \"most likely triggering cause\" of microcephaly without adequate evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on the opinion of a single expert, Dr. Gary Kohls, without considering the broader scientific consensus on the topic.", "Understate": "The claim understates the uncertainty and complexity surrounding the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, suggesting a simplistic and unsupported explanation."}
