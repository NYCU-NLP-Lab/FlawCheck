{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving\" lacks sufficient support. The National Safety Council stopped tracking texting and driving in 2015, and there are no reliable estimates of the number of crashes caused by distracted driving.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that texting and driving is the sole cause of 25% of car accidents in the U.S., without considering other potential causes such as weather, impaired driving, or other technology-related distractions.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the role of texting and driving in car accidents, as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety states that there is a clear connection between cellphone use and crash risk based on several studies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing consistent and reliable data to support the assertion that texting and driving causes 25% of car accidents in the U.S.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for car accidents, such as weather conditions, impaired driving, or other technology-related distractions."}
