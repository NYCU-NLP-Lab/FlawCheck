{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Donald Trump's ownership in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, as it only mentions that he owns a stake without specifying the exact amount or percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that Donald Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66. The provided sources mention stock ownership but do not provide conclusive evidence of current ownership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ownership in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66 automatically implies a direct involvement in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. However, there is no explicit evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the ownership of stocks in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66 by Donald Trump may have been divested or sold before the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline or the events mentioned in the sources. This alternative explanation is suggested by Trump's spokeswoman's statement that he sold his remaining shares in Energy Transfer Partners in mid-2016."}
