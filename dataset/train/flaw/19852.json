{"Contradict fact": "The claim suggests that the image shows the ghost of Paul Walker on the set of the eighth movie in \"The Fast and the Furious\" franchise. However, the expert's verdict contradicts this by explaining that the image is fake and shows one of Walker's brothers, who was partially erased to give him a ghostly appearance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the existence of Paul Walker's ghost in the image.

The expert's verdict presents a more factual and grounded explanation for the image.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication of the claim faltering at times in the provided information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image depicts the ghost of Paul Walker without providing substantial evidence. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by providing the true context of the image.", "Other biases": "None of the other provided biases (such as \"Falters at times\" or \"Problematic assumption\") are applicable to the claim and expert's verdict."}
