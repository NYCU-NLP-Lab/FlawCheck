{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Prabowo Subianto's control over state intelligence, military, and national police by stating that he has \"absolute authority\" over them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the appointment of Prabowo Subianto as defense minister means that he now controls state intelligence, military, and national police, without providing sufficient evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that Prabowo Subianto controls state intelligence, military, and national police.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Indonesian law stipulates that the state intelligence, national police, and military are under the president's command, not under the control of the defense minister.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual power and authority of the president in controlling state intelligence, military, and national police, by suggesting that Prabowo Subianto has taken over half of the president's power."}
