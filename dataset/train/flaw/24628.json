{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the name of the acid attacker in the movie was changed to 'Rajesh'. It is based on an IMDB link and tweets without any official confirmation or reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in the name of the acid attacker in the movie is a deliberate attempt to maintain secularism. However, there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the change in the name of the acid attacker in the movie, such as creative decisions or legal considerations. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and jumps to the conclusion of a deliberate attempt to maintain secularism.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the movie is inspired by the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Aggarwal, who was attacked by Naeem Khan, not Rajesh. The claim's assertion that the movie portrays Khan as 'Rajesh' contradicts this fact.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by presenting a simplified narrative that the change in the name is solely motivated by secularism. It fails to consider other factors that could have influenced the decision.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the name change by suggesting that it is a reflection of the broader issue of secularism. It may overstate the impact and intention behind the change without sufficient evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on tweets and social media posts as evidence, which may not always be reliable or accurate. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis or investigation into the name change."}
