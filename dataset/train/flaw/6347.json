{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the tax hike on middle-class families by stating that it will be a $4,000 increase, without providing enough evidence or context to support this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that there will be a $4,000 tax hike on middle-class families under President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the study from the American Enterprise Institute, which focuses on interest payments on the national debt, directly translates to a tax hike on the middle class. However, the study does not explicitly describe a tax hike.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the cost that must be paid, such as how it is paid, by whom, and when. It simplifies the issue by attributing the entire cost to Obama, without acknowledging other factors contributing to the rising debt."}
