{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the crackdown in Uganda following the 2021 election by presenting the video as recent footage when it was actually filmed in 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the connection between the video and the 2021 election, as it is based on a Facebook post by a political adviser and does not provide direct evidence linking the two.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the violent crackdown shown in the video is directly related to the election, without providing concrete evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it was originally broadcast in 2018 during clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters, suggesting that the footage may not be directly linked to the 2021 election."}
