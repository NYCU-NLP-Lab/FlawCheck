{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pete Buttigieg was asked about a temporal limit on a woman's right to have an abortion, but this is not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide the actual transcript of Pete Buttigieg's response, so there may be a lack of supporting evidence to fully evaluate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Without the transcript, there could be alternative explanations or contexts for Pete Buttigieg's response that are not addressed in the claim."}
