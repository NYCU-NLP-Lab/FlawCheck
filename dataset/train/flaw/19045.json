{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the homelessness problem in California by using the term \"skyrocketed\" without providing specific data or comparison to other states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that California has the nation's highest homelessness rate and homeless population. The expert's analysis highlights the need for more comprehensive data and a longer-term perspective.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in California's homeless population is solely due to a shortage of affordable housing, without considering other factors that may contribute to homelessness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the rise in homelessness in California is not unique to the state but also seen in other West Coast cities. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in homelessness beyond just California-specific factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the national homeless population remained 13 percent lower in 2017 compared to 2010, while California's homeless population increased."}
