{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of cash on hand for USPS by stating it is approximately $15 billion, while the expert's verdict states that USPS had $14.2 billion in cash on hand as of Aug. 12.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that USPS has the most cash on hand in its history.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having the most cash on hand equates to financial stability, without considering other factors such as ongoing debt and financial losses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that being in debt means a company still owes money, indicating that having a considerable amount of cash on hand does not necessarily indicate financial health."}
