{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC report did not assess the impact of mask wearing on getting the coronavirus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the CDC report by stating that \"almost everyone\" who wore a mask got infected, when the actual numbers were 70.6% and 14.4%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a small sample size of 154 people and does not represent all positive cases in July.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wearing masks is ineffective because some people who wore masks still got infected, without considering other factors such as exposure in bars and restaurants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by the expert that the correlation between testing positive and wearing masks may be due to other factors like going to bars and restaurants where masks cannot be effectively worn."}
