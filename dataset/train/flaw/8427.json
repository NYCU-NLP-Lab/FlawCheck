{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. Army is sending text messages informing people they've been selected for the military draft. The expert's verdict clearly states that these messages were fraudulent and not sent out by the Army.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or proof provided to support the assertion that the U.S. Army is sending draft messages.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. Army is sending draft messages based on the trepidation and increased searches for draft-related terms after the death of Iran Gen. Qassem Soleimani. However, this assumption is incorrect as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origin of the fraudulent draft messages. It attributes them to the U.S. Army without considering other possible sources or individuals responsible for creating and spreading the messages."}
