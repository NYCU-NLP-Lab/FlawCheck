{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that migrants are being asked to pay a bribe to walk on the railway tracks, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video of a policeman collecting money from a group of women, without providing further context or evidence to support the claim that migrants are being asked to pay a bribe.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the policeman in the video is demanding money from migrants walking to their native places in Gujarat, without providing concrete evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the policeman collecting money from the women in the video, such as the possibility of it being an isolated incident or the context surrounding the situation."}
