{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Cal Cunningham has been completely silent on the issue of defunding the police, when in fact he has expressed his stance on some reforms but not defunding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cunningham's silence on defunding the police implies consent, without considering other possible reasons for his silence or alternative explanations for his stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Cunningham's silence on defunding the police equates to consent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Cunningham's silence on the issue, such as strategic reasons or a desire to focus on other policy areas."}
