{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money spent on remodeling the bathrooms at the governor's mansion. The actual cost was $250,000, not over $250,000.", "Understate": "The claim understates the reasons for the proposed cuts in services for children. It fails to mention that the cuts were part of a larger budget proposal to address a $3.2 billion budget hole during a national economic downturn.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that Strickland proposed cuts for services for children. It is based on assumptions and there is no direct evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the bathroom remodeling expenses were wasteful, without considering the purpose of the renovations and the fact that they were funded by private donations and taxpayer money.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the bathroom remodeling was not initiated by Strickland, but was set aside in a previous administration's budget."}
