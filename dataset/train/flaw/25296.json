{"Contradict fact": "The claim that a dead man born in 1902 voted in the 2020 election in Michigan contradicts the fact that \"no ballot for the 118-year-old Mr. Bradley was ever requested, received or counted,\" according to Lawrence Garcia, Detroit Corporation Counsel.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by suggesting that a dead man actually voted, when in fact it was a clerical error that attributed a ballot to the wrong person with a similar name.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on social media posts and speculation rather than concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a deceased person's name in the voter information center indicates fraudulent voting, without considering the possibility of clerical errors or other explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that there are two individuals named William Bradley registered at the same address, one born in 1902 and one born in 1959. The incorrect attribution of the ballot to the deceased Bradley was a result of a clerical error."}
