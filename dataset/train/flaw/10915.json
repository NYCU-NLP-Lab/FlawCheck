{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Romney's stance on coal-fired plants by stating that he \"condemned\" them and said they \"kill people.\" The provided evidence suggests that Romney supported regulations to reduce emissions from power plants, but there is no clear indication that he explicitly condemned or made such a strong statement about coal-fired plants killing people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's statements about coal-fired plants in Massachusetts can be directly applied to his current position and views on coal as a presidential candidate. It assumes a consistency in his stance over time without considering potential changes or shifts in his position.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Romney condemned coal-fired plants and said they kill people. The evidence provided only shows his support for regulations to reduce emissions and protect public health, but does not directly address the claim made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Romney's statements in Massachusetts were specific to the context of the Salem Harbor Power Station and the specific health and environmental concerns associated with it. It is possible that his stance on coal-fired plants in general may differ from his position on that specific power station."}
