{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the progress made with the provision of infrastructure by stating that \"significant progress\" has been made and over R1.3 trillion has been invested. It is not clear if this amount of investment and progress is accurately represented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that over R1.3 trillion has been invested in infrastructure and more than a million homes have been built. Without sufficient supporting information, it is difficult to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the investment in infrastructure and the provision of homes has been successful in addressing the infrastructure needs of the country. However, it does not provide any information or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the progress made in infrastructure provision, such as the contribution of foreign direct investment or other factors. The claim does not acknowledge or explore these alternative explanations."}
