{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the sequence of events by implying that the LAPD released the Mexican national after the ICE detainer request and that he was arrested for murder shortly after. However, the murder occurred before the detainer request was issued.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the LAPD ignored the ICE detainer request. The expert's analysis suggests that the detainer request was issued after the murder had already taken place.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if the LAPD had honored the ICE detainer request, the murder could have been prevented. However, there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the murder occurred before the ICE detainer request was issued, suggesting a misrepresentation of the timeline of events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the release of the Mexican national, such as legal limitations or other factors that may have influenced the LAPD's decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the sequence of events and the actions of the LAPD, which undermines its credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the claim."}
