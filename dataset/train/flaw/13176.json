{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Scott Walker cut school funding, as it states that he cut more per student than any governor in America.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools, implying that the cuts were permanent and ongoing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that Walker cut school funding more per student than any other governor, as it relies on a table from a single source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money saved from the school funding cuts went to Scott Walker's friends, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the school funding cuts, such as budget constraints or other priorities."}
