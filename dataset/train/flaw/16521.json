{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that Hindu women infiltrated the Lucknow's Clock Tower protests and raised slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad'.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of two women dressed in burqas caught by the police in Gonda city in 2017 is the same as the alleged incident in Lucknow's Clock Tower protests in 2020. This assumption is problematic as it does not provide concrete evidence to establish a connection between the two incidents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, which suggests that the women in the video were masquerading as Muslims during a local body election in Gonda city in 2017, rather than infiltrating the anti-CAA protests in Lucknow.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from a different incident in Gonda city in 2017, where the women were caught masquerading as Muslims during a local body election.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the alleged actions of the women by stating that they infiltrated the protests and raised slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad'. There is no evidence to support this exaggerated claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and making assumptions without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
