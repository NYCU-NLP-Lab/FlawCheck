{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of patients who developed Bell's palsy after taking the trial vaccine. The expert's verdict mentions that four out of more than 20,000 patients developed Bell's palsy, which is a relatively small number compared to the total number of participants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to definitively link the trial vaccine to the development of Bell's palsy. The expert's verdict states that there is no definitive evidence that the vaccine caused Bell's palsy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that the vaccine caused Bell's palsy based on the occurrence of four cases among the vaccine group. The expert's verdict clarifies that the incident rate of Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may fail to consider alternative explanations for the cases of Bell's palsy among the vaccine group. The expert's verdict mentions that the incident rate in the vaccine group is similar to the background rate in the general population, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to the development of Bell's palsy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the individuals pictured in the tweet are not the same individuals involved in the COVID-19 vaccine trial. The expert's verdict clarifies that the image was included to illustrate the type of facial paralysis associated with Bell's palsy, but it is not related to the vaccine trial.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the association between the trial vaccine and the development of Bell's palsy by not providing the full context of the incident rate. The expert's verdict emphasizes that the incident rate in the vaccine group did not exceed the background rate in the general population.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information."}
