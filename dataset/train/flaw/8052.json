{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which all healthcare in Canada is provided without out-of-pocket expenses. While hospital visits and care at the doctor's office are covered 100 percent, there are out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and some outpatient care.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the existence of out-of-pocket costs in Canada's healthcare system. Although these costs are lower than in the United States, they can still be substantial.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the statement that \"they have provided quality care to all people without out-of-pocket expenses.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is different from the Canadian system, indicating that there may be differences in the level of coverage and out-of-pocket expenses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that all healthcare in Canada is completely free without any out-of-pocket expenses. The expert's verdict highlights that prescription drugs and certain outpatient care fall outside of the core package and may require out-of-pocket payments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the differences in healthcare systems between Canada and the United States. The expert's verdict mentions that Sanders' proposal is different from the Canadian system, suggesting that there may be variations in coverage and cost-sharing mechanisms."}
