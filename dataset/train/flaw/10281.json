{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Governor Scott Walker that his political opponents \"brought 100,000 protesters into our state\" is an exaggeration. Police estimated the crowd at 68,000 people, and there is no evidence to support the claim that the vast majority of demonstrators came from outside of Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "Governor Walker assumes that the protesters were brought in by his political opponents, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The campaign cited isolated reports of demonstrators being bused in from Illinois and New York, but there is no substantial evidence provided to support the claim that 100,000 protesters were brought into Wisconsin.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim falters at times as Governor Walker himself stated in a phone conversation that \"almost all\" of the protesters were from outside of Wisconsin, but there is no evidence to support this statement.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of protesters by suggesting that only 100,000 protesters were brought into the state, while police estimated the crowd at 68,000 people."}
