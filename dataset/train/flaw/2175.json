{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the prevalence and significance of the trend of boiling menstrual pads and drinking the water to get \"high\" or \"drunk\" among Indonesian teens. The expert's verdict states that it is not a new trend and is not encountered often by local officials.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the alarming nature of the trend. The expert's verdict mentions that the reports are based on a low number of incidents and are sensationalized for clickbait purposes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trend is widespread among Indonesian teens, while the expert's verdict suggests that it is limited to a small number of children in specific regions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the trend may be a result of child poverty and voyeuristic reporting rather than a genuine desire for getting high or drunk.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the trend is not new and has been documented since at least 2016, as stated by local officials.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict points out that the reporting on this trend falls into the \"teens do stupid things to get high\" genre, which is often exaggerated and lacks credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or expert's verdict."}
