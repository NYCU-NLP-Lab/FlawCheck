{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children who died in bathtubs compared to those killed accidentally by guns. The data shows that in every age group except for children aged 0-4, guns are actually more deadly than bathtubs.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to Carlson to learn the source of his claim but did not receive a response. This lack of supporting evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison between bathtub deaths and accidental gun deaths is relevant to the issue of gun safety laws for children. However, the data provided shows that in most age groups, guns are more deadly than bathtubs, suggesting that the focus should be on gun safety measures rather than bathtubs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data provided by the federal government's Center for Health Statistics, which shows that in most age groups, guns are more deadly than bathtubs.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of accidental gun deaths by comparing it only to deaths from drowning in bathtubs. It fails to consider other causes of accidental gun deaths, such as unintentional shootings or mishandling of firearms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a comparison between bathtub deaths and accidental gun deaths, but there could be other factors contributing to the higher number of accidental gun deaths, such as the availability and accessibility of firearms."}
