{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that Doug MacGinnitie \"hadn't voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008.\" The expert's verdict states that MacGinnitie actually voted six times in Republican primaries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not voting in Republican primaries for almost 20 years is a negative characteristic for a Republican candidate. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement about MacGinnitie's voting history. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides evidence from the Georgia secretary of state's voting records to refute the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by the Kemp campaign, which states that MacGinnitie started voting in state Republican primaries in 2008 when he was preparing to run for higher office."}
