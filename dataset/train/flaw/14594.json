{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the new college tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents. It fails to mention the additional costs that Wisconsin residents would have to pay under the new agreement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to back up the assertion that the new agreement makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that making tuition bills smaller automatically widens access to higher education and is a win-win situation for students and Wisconsin, without considering other factors that may affect access to education.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or perspectives that could challenge the claim, such as the fact that the new agreement actually results in Wisconsin residents paying more for tuition at Minnesota schools."}
