{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the migrants by stating that they drew a swastika on an American flag and set it on fire. The expert's verdict clarifies that the image was real, but it did not depict members of the caravan defacing the flag with a swastika.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that migrants in the caravan committed the mentioned actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals in the image are part of the caravan, which is proven to be false by the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the individuals in the image were not part of the caravan but were protesting the treatment of migrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it was taken during a protest in front of the American embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and not directly related to the migrant caravan."}
