{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential harm caused by cosmic rays passing near Earth by stating that it can cause bodily harm if personal electronics are kept near.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to substantiate the assertion that dangerous cosmic rays will pass near Earth and cause bodily harm.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cosmic rays passing near Earth pose a significant risk to human health, without providing any evidence or scientific basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for cosmic rays, stating that they can originate from sources outside the solar system as well as from energetic events on the sun. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the presence of cosmic rays near Earth, which the claim fails to acknowledge."}
