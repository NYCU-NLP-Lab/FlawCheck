{"Lack enough support": "The claim that 50 percent of social services in the United States are provided by the Catholic church lacks sufficient supporting evidence. The experts consulted for the article were not aware of this statistic, and the data on Catholic-sponsored charity is difficult to quantify accurately.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Catholic church provides a significant portion of social services in the United States without providing substantial evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive answer on the extent of Catholic-backed charity and its contribution to overall charitable activity in the country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions that Catholic Charities is supplemented by other Catholic-affiliated groups, suggesting that the social services provided by the Catholic church may be spread across various organizations, making it difficult to attribute a specific percentage to the church alone."}
