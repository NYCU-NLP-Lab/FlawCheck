{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill was actually signed into law by President Obama's predecessor, not by President Obama himself.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating President Obama's role in helping veterans and military family members go to college through the G.I. Bill, as it implies that he was primarily responsible for the initiative.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the statement that President Obama \"helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill.\" Additional evidence or data would be needed to verify this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama played a significant role in the implementation and impact of the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, without acknowledging the efforts of other individuals, such as Senator Jim Webb, who introduced the bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the increase in the number of veterans and military family members going to college through the G.I. Bill may be attributed to the expansion and enhancements made to the bill by Congress in 2010, rather than solely to President Obama's actions."}
