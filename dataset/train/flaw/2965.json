{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Obama's job approval rating is up\" lacks enough support as it is based on a single poll and does not consider other sources or trends in approval ratings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase of three percentage points in approval rating is significant, without considering the margin of error and the overall stability of the rating.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in approval rating, such as changes in the political climate or the specific events that occurred during the polling period.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, stating that Obama's approval rating is up but also acknowledging that not much has changed statistically since December.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the increase in approval rating by not providing a clear comparison to previous ratings or considering the overall trend.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama's approval rating has been relatively stable and does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that it is significantly up.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the increase in approval rating by not considering the margin of error and the overall stability of the rating."}
