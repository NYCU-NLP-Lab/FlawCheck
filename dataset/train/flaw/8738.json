{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a letter sent by an individual claiming to have extrasensory perception (ESP). ESP is not supported by rigorous science, and the letter does not provide any verifiable evidence or scientific data to support the prediction of a large earthquake and deadly tsunami in the Indian Ocean.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prediction made by someone with ESP is reliable and accurate. However, ESP is not supported by scientific evidence, and relying on such claims without proper scientific backing is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific knowledge about earthquake prediction. The expert explains that earthquake prediction is still a major challenge for seismology, and the best science can offer is probability estimates and warnings after an earthquake has occurred.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact and scope of the predicted earthquake and tsunami. It suggests that the earthquake will shake the entire coast of Asian continental areas, extend into eleven countries, and even reach Gulf countries. Such extensive impact is an exaggeration and lacks sufficient scientific support.", "Understate": "None of the biases selected in the expert's verdict can be categorized as understating the claim."}
