{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to validate the assertion that an elephant saved a bus from rolling into a valley. The only evidence provided is an image, which is later debunked as being unrelated to the claimed incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of an elephant pushing a bus is evidence of it saving lives. However, there is no direct evidence or context provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the image is not from Uttarakhand, India, and that it is unrelated to a bus falling into a trench. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the elephant saved lives in Uttarakhand.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it was taken in Bangladesh and shows an elephant pushing a stranded bus to clear a road. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion of the elephant saving lives.", "Understate": "None apparent.", "Exaggerate": "None apparent.", "Falters at times": "None apparent."}
