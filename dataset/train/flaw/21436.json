{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential job loss by stating that \"almost 4 million people will lose their jobs\" if a $15 minimum wage is mandated. The expert's verdict clarifies that the high end of the Congressional Budget Office's range of potential outcomes is 2.7 million job losses, not 4 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that \"government statistics say almost 4 million people will lose their jobs.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is based on the high end of the CBO's range of potential outcomes, but the low end of the range was \"about zero\" jobs lost.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $15 minimum wage will directly result in job losses without considering other factors or alternative explanations. The expert's verdict mentions that the CBO report estimates a range of potential job losses, and there is a significant possibility of large reductions in employment, but it does not definitively attribute all job losses to the minimum wage increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for potential job losses, such as automation or other economic factors. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations either, but it does mention that the CBO report estimates a range of potential job losses, indicating that there could be other factors at play.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a single statistic without acknowledging the range of potential outcomes or the uncertainty involved. The expert's verdict highlights the different estimates and possibilities presented in the CBO report, indicating that the claim's presentation of a single statistic is not comprehensive.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any established facts, but it presents an incomplete and potentially misleading interpretation of the CBO report. The expert's verdict clarifies the actual estimates and findings of the report, providing a more accurate representation of the facts."}
