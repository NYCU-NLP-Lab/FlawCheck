{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the financial assistance provided by Malaysia during the pandemic. It states that Malaysia distributes money to all citizens and waives electricity bills for six months, whereas the expert's verdict clarifies that the financial assistance is targeted towards lower-income households and the electricity bills are subsidized, not waived entirely.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Malaysia's relief package is superior to Thailand's, implying that Thailand is being selective in providing financial aid. However, the expert's verdict explains that the comparison is misleading as Thailand also has a government COVID-19 relief package in place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to back up its assertion about Malaysia's relief measures. It simply presents a graphic and a comparison with Thailand without providing any official sources or detailed information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the electricity bills in Malaysia are not waived entirely, but rather subsidized during the crisis. The expert's verdict clarifies this by citing the announcement from Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Malaysia's electricity provider.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents Malaysia's relief package as a benchmark and questions why Thailand's relief package is selective. However, the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Thailand also has a government COVID-19 relief package, which undermines the claim's assumption."}
