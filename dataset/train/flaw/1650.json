{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 99.8% of Americans referred to in the tweet are not receiving any tax cuts under Trump's new tax plan, without clarifying that this specifically refers to the repeal of the estate tax.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that 99.8% of Americans are not receiving any tax cuts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are tax cuts in Trump's new tax plan, but it only focuses on the estate tax repeal.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Trump's tax plan on other taxes or deductions that could affect different income groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or interpretations for the 99.8% figure, such as it referring specifically to the estate tax and not the overall tax plan."}
