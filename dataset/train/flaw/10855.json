{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that \"Anti-Vasundhara Raje slogans\" were raised at PM Modi's rally, when in fact the video was from a different rally where both Raje and Modi were present.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a video that is unrelated to the event being described.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shared by the Indian National Congress and Divya Spandana is evidence of anti-Raje slogans being raised at PM Modi's rally, without verifying the authenticity of the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have an alternative explanation that the video was shared mistakenly or intentionally to create a false narrative."}
