{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there are historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal connection between historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates without providing evidence or addressing alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The expert points out that the statistics provided by the NRA and Fred Thompson fall short in several ways, including the use of outdated estimates and the lack of a national gun registry.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the increase in violent crime rates in recent years, as indicated by the FBI's reports of a 2.3 percent increase in 2005 and a 1.3 percent increase in 2006.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the FBI's reports of an increase in violent crime rates, suggesting that the claim's assertion of historically low violent crime rates may not align with factual data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there are advocates on both sides of the issue who use statistics to argue their own cases, implying that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the relationship between gun ownership and crime rates."}
