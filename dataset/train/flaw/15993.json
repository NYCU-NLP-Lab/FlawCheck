{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that students must take the Flu, HPV, and COVID-19 vaccines to attend school, when in fact the bill does not mention these specific vaccines and does not make them mandatory.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the details of the bill and the exemptions it provides for parents who do not want to vaccinate their children.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific information to back up its assertion that the bill removes exemptions for vaccines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that the bill is \"horrendous\" without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the bill is aimed at increasing vaccination rates and formalizing the process for receiving exemptions, rather than removing exemptions entirely.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bill has not become law yet, and therefore cannot be accurately described as \"removing exemptions\" or requiring specific vaccines for students to attend school.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the claim."}
