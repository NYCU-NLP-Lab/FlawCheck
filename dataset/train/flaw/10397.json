{"Lack enough support": "The claim of Aamir Khan meeting with LeT terrorists lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that meeting with individuals who are critical of India or have different political views automatically makes someone associated with terrorists.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by providing evidence that the individuals in the photo were not LeT terrorists but rather a Pakistani singer and an Islamic preacher.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by linking it to terrorism and implying that it proves Aamir Khan's anti-India stance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photo, highlighting that it was taken during a meeting with a singer and an Islamic preacher, rather than terrorists."}
