{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video and image are from a visit that took place in June 2019, not after the recent Maharashtra polls.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a false narrative and does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray visited the Ajmer Dargah after the Maharashtra polls.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that visiting a religious place after an electoral victory is a political necessity for politicians.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the visit to the Ajmer Dargah was unrelated to the Maharashtra polls and was a personal or religious visit by Aaditya Thackeray."}
