{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Donald Trump \"hasn't broken his promise\" to release his tax returns lacks enough support because there is evidence that he has made promises to release them in the past.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's promise to release his tax returns is valid, but there is evidence to suggest that he has not fulfilled this promise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Donald Trump has not released his tax returns due to an ongoing IRS audit, as he has stated multiple times.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because there are instances where Donald Trump has suggested that he may release his tax returns, but with conditions or after certain events occur.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump has made statements implying that he would release his tax returns in the past, but has not done so.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Donald Trump has fulfilled his promise to release his tax returns, as there is evidence that he has not done so."}
