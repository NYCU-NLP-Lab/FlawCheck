{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the suspect was \"almost set ablaze,\" which may be an exaggeration as there is no evidence or confirmation of this in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The image shared in the claim is not directly linked to the alleged incident of gassing. The expert's verdict mentions that the image has been used in other unrelated stories in the past, suggesting a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man in the image is a suspect of chemical gassing without providing any concrete evidence or verification. It is an assumption based on the image alone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the image shows a man being escorted by uniformed officers, which suggests an alternative explanation to the claim that the man was almost set ablaze by residents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that the image shows a suspect of chemical gassing, but the expert's verdict does not confirm or provide any evidence supporting this fact. The image alone does not prove the claim.", "Understate": "There is no indication of any bias of understating in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication of any bias of faltering at times in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
