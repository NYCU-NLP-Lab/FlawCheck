{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the sole evidence for the claim comes from a pair of smartphone screen captures, but the origin and authenticity of these screenshots could not be verified. This lack of corroborating evidence weakens the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that at no point did Jorgensen have a reported number over 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania. Therefore, the claim of losing over 40,000 votes in 10 minutes contradicts this fact.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in votes for Jorgensen was due to some kind of error or manipulation. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the shift in vote count occurred early in the election night when in-person votes were being tallied, and if it were a data entry error, it would have represented the addition of votes, not the subtraction of them. Therefore, the claim's assumption about the cause of the vote loss is problematic.", "Understate": "The claim states that Jorgensen lost over 40,000 votes in 10 minutes, but the expert's verdict mentions that at the time of reporting, Jorgensen had 77,091 votes in Pennsylvania. This suggests that the claim may be understating the actual number of votes Jorgensen received.", "Exaggerate": "Although the claim does not exaggerate the number of votes Jorgensen lost, it does exaggerate the speed at which the votes were lost, implying that it happened in just 10 minutes. The expert's verdict mentions that the screenshot captures were separated by 12 minutes, which contradicts the claim's timeframe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the shift in vote count occurred when in-person votes were being tallied, and it could be a result of normal data entry or reporting processes. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in Jorgensen's vote count, which the claim fails to consider."}
