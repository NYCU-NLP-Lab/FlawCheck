{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that the federal government only allows health insurance companies to keep 15 percent of their revenues, while in reality, the provision mentioned in the expert's verdict requires insurance companies to spend at least 80-85 percent of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the regulation mentioned by Rick Santorum is a negative aspect of government control over insurance policies and access. However, this assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that the federal government regulates how much money health insurance companies are allowed to keep.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the purpose and impact of the regulation mentioned. It presents the regulation as a means for the government to control insurance policies, without exploring potential benefits or reasons behind its implementation."}
