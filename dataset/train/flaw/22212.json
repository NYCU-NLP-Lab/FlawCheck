{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of pension plans for public workers in Rhode Island by stating that there are 150 different plans, while the expert's verdict provides evidence that there are actually 113 different named pension plans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that there are 150 different pension plans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having multiple pension plans is \"absolutely crazy\" and that there should be only one plan for all workers. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account the specific needs and circumstances of different public worker groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the existence of multiple pension plans, such as different designs and funding levels based on municipalities and specific employee groups. This suggests that there are valid reasons for the existence of multiple plans."}
