{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the photograph depicts a small boy being held in a cage by ICE in 2018. The photograph actually shows a child standing in a mocked-up \"cage\" during a protest, not being detained by immigration authorities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the boy in the photograph was actually detained by ICE in 2018. It is later clarified that the photograph was taken during a protest and not in a detention facility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is a direct representation of the Trump administration's immigration policies and criticizes them based on this assumption. However, the photograph does not depict a child being detained by immigration authorities but rather a child reacting to seeing his mother outside the \"cage.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photograph, which is that it was taken during a protest to highlight the practice of separating families and confining undocumented children, rather than being a result of Trump-era immigration policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph does not show a child confined by immigration authorities but rather a child participating in a protest."}
