Election officials in the state have found no evidence of wrongdoing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions of the workers in the video are suspicious or nefarious, without considering the possibility that they were simply following standard procedures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by Georgia Election System Implementation Manager Gabriel Sterling, who stated that the workers were packing the ballots into their proper containers in plain view of monitors and the press.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that election officials in the state have found no wrongdoing."}
