While Biden's plan suggests using the additional tax revenue for this purpose, it is not explicitly guaranteed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or potential reasons for Biden's proposal to eliminate the \"stepped-up basis\" tax policy. It only focuses on the impact on inheritance taxes and the potential funding for free community college.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any facts presented in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make exaggerated claims.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times or present inconsistent information."}
