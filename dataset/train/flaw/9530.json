{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who are not working today compared to four years ago. The actual number is 358,000 fewer people working in December 2012 than December 2008, not 8.3 million.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual decrease in employment by using a much larger number than the real data shows.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the actual data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics contradicts the claim made by Sean Hannity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the number of Americans working is solely due to President Obama's policies, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decrease in employment, such as workers leaving the workforce for personal reasons like becoming stay-at-home parents."}
