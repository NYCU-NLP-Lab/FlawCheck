{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Muslim women are more likely to be unemployed or not in the job market compared to women generally. The expert's verdict mentions that Muslim women are more likely to be unemployed, but it does not explicitly state the specific ratios mentioned in the claim (three times as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely not to be in the jobs market).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the ratios mentioned (three times as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely not to be in the jobs market). The expert's verdict mentions that the figures are correct according to official data, but it does not provide the exact statistics or sources for these ratios.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the higher unemployment rate among Muslim women cannot be entirely explained by factors such as English language skills, education levels, or religious objections to certain jobs. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks potential contributing factors to the disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that discrimination could be a contributing factor to the higher unemployment rate among Muslim women. This alternative explanation implies that factors other than those mentioned in the claim may play a role in the disparity.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the report by MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee does not explicitly state that Muslim women are three times more likely to be unemployed. This contradicts the claim's statement that Muslim women are three times as likely to be unemployed.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the unemployment rate among Muslim women by not providing specific data or statistics. The expert's verdict mentions that the unemployment rate in the group was 16% in 2015, which is significantly higher than the average unemployment rate for all women (around 5%).", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing comprehensive data or considering all factors that contribute to the higher unemployment rate among Muslim women. The expert's verdict highlights that the gap in unemployment rates between Muslim women and all women has not narrowed, but it does not provide a complete analysis of all possible reasons for this disparity."}
