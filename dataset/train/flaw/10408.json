{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people that Sayfullo Saipov brought with him into the United States through \"chain migration.\" There is no evidence to support this claim, and experts consider it an implausible exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Sayfullo Saipov brought 22 people with him.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Saipov brought 22 people with him based on President Trump's statements. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Saipov arrived in the United States through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program in 2010, which does not allow for sponsoring 22 family members.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of people Saipov may have brought with him, such as the possibility of family members joining him through other legal means like the lottery system.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on President Trump's statements without providing additional evidence or verification."}
