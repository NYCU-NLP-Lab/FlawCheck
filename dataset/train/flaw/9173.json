{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of criminal immigrants in the country illegally by stating that there are \"probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million\" when the Department of Homeland Security report only estimated 1.9 million \"removable criminal aliens\" at the time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the estimated number of criminal immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 1.9 million \"removable criminal aliens\" mentioned in the DHS report are here illegally, which is not accurate as the term \"criminal aliens\" includes both legal and illegal immigrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or provide information on the percentage or number of immigrants in the country illegally with criminal convictions, as stated by an ICE official.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the DHS report did not specify how many \"criminal aliens\" are here illegally and that the 1.9 million total includes immigrants who are here legally.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of criminal immigrants in the country illegally by not considering the possibility of a higher number than the estimated 1.9 million."}
