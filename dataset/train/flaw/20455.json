{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study has limitations and caveats that may have influenced or skewed the findings. This suggests that there may not be enough support to fully validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that the study was conducted during the onset of the pandemic, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other contexts or time periods. This indicates a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is a byproduct of the study and that researchers did not set out to specifically characterize transmission rates by age groups. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the findings and the claim may not fully capture the complexity of the study."}
