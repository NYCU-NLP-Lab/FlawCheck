{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the steps taken in the stimulus by stating that \"there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.\" The actual estimates from various sources range from 800,000 to 2.4 million jobs saved or created.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on projections and estimates that are subject to a large margin of error. The White House Council of Economic Advisers report acknowledges the difficulty in measuring the exact impact of the stimulus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the jobs currently held by Americans are solely due to the steps taken in the stimulus. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for job creation or retention.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the current employment levels, such as natural economic recovery or other government policies that have contributed to job growth.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by selectively highlighting the top end of the advisers' projection and not acknowledging the wide range of estimates provided by different sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the exact number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus is a matter of intense partisan disagreement. Different sources provide varying estimates, and the claim presents a single estimate without acknowledging the controversy surrounding it.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the uncertainty and margin of error associated with estimating the impact of the stimulus. The CEA report and the Congressional Budget Office both acknowledge the difficulty in accurately measuring the effects of fiscal stimulus."}
