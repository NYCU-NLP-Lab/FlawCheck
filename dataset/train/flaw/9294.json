{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people crossing the border by showing footage of \"dozens\" of people, implying a large-scale influx.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the footage used in the ad is not actually from the southern border between the United States and Mexico, but from a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Mexicans are \"swarming\" over the southern border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the footage shown in the ad accurately represents the situation at the southern border, which is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decrease in Mexican immigration, such as economic factors and stricter enforcement of immigration laws."}
