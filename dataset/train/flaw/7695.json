{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of voter identification laws by stating that they \"keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting.\" The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence to support or contradict this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a figure from the Brennan Center for Justice, which comes from a 2006 survey. However, it does not provide further evidence or analysis to support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voter identification laws are intentionally designed to suppress the votes of certain groups, such as poor people, minorities, the elderly, and students. The expert's verdict does not explicitly address this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that advocates of voter identification laws argue for the need to prevent voter fraud. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the existence of such laws, which the claim does not acknowledge."}
