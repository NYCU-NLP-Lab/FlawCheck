{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of time it took for help to be sent to Americans under fire during the Benghazi attack.

The expert's verdict explains that it was the military, under the Defense Department and the president, that was moving forces towards Libya.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that no action by Clinton or anyone in the administration could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no action by Clinton or the administration could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
