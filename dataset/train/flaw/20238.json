{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"Biden wants to defund the police\" is repeatedly debunked and false, as stated by the expert. The Trump campaign has spent a significant amount of money promoting this claim, which exaggerates Biden's stance on defunding the police.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden has explicitly stated he does not support defunding the police. He has expressed his belief in funding the police for initiatives to strengthen community relationships and for body-worn cameras.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or reference in the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations that suggests defunding or abolishing the police. The expert also mentions that the White House did not provide any evidence to support Trump's claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Biden wants to defund the police based on a charter he signed with Bernie Sanders. However, there is no mention of defunding the police in that charter.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights an alternative explanation that Biden's supporters may favor defunding the police, but Biden himself has not expressed support for it. The claim fails to acknowledge this alternative explanation and instead attributes the stance directly to Biden."}
