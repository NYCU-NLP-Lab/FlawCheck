{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the White House staff compiled a number of gorilla documentaries into a makeshift gorilla channel for President Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or mention of a gorilla channel in the book \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\" by Michael Wolff.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tweet about the gorilla channel is true, without verifying the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations, such as the tweet being a hoax or a prank, as suggested by the expert's verdict."}
