{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bernie Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns based on his support for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This assumption may not be fully supported or accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Bernie Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns. It is based on a statement made by Hillary Clinton and the interpretation of Sanders' support for the 2005 law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Sanders' support for the 2005 law, such as his stance on gun rights and the protection of gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits."}
