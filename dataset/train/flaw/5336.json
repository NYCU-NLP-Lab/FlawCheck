{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the business investment growth under Republican policies by stating it is \"10 times faster\" than under President Obama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only compares the final two years of the Obama administration to a little over the first two years of the Trump administration, which may not provide a comprehensive analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the business investment growth can be solely attributed to Republican policies, disregarding other factors at work.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there are many other factors at work in the recent growth, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the business investment growth."}
