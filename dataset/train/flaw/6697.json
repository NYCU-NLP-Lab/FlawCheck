{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Obama's economic plan by comparing the number of new government jobs to the size of the post office work force. The claim implies that creating 600,000 government jobs would be a significant and potentially problematic outcome.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that creating 600,000 new government jobs would be a negative outcome without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that creating 600,000 government jobs would be problematic or comparable to the size of the post office work force. It does not provide any evidence or analysis to justify this comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of new government jobs proposed by Obama's economic plan. It does not explore potential benefits or reasons behind the inclusion of these jobs in the plan."}
