{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the actions of the Obama administration by stating that they \"willfully leaked\" the existence of STUXNET, implying intentional and deliberate action.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the OPSEC group referred them to a June 2012 New York Times article and comments from two senators as supporting information. It suggests that there may not be enough concrete evidence or additional sources to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration leaked the existence of STUXNET, without providing substantial evidence or considering alternative explanations for the leak.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Obama administration admitting involvement in STUXNET may have undermined their ability to work with other countries on technology and made it clear to the Iranians who was responsible. This suggests that there could be alternative reasons for the leak, such as strategic or diplomatic considerations.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not provide any information that directly contradicts the claim, but it does mention that the OPSEC group has made other claims that were rated as false or mostly false. This could cast doubt on the credibility of the group and their claims.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear from the provided information whether the claim falters at times, as the expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or weaknesses in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay the significance of the alleged leak."}
