{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the cost of fire in Rhode Island by stating that it is \"anywhere from 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive than anywhere else we could find.\" This range of percentages may be an exaggeration to emphasize the high costs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of firefighting costs in Rhode Island with every other community in the country. The comparison is limited to certain areas and regions, making it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the cost difference.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of fire in Rhode Island is excessively high without considering potential reasons or factors that may contribute to the higher costs. It does not explore alternative explanations for the cost differences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher firefighting costs in Rhode Island, such as differences in population density, infrastructure, or other factors that may impact the cost of fire services.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of firefighting costs. It compares Rhode Island to areas that may not be suitable for comparison and may not provide a complete picture of the cost differences.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting facts in the claim."}
