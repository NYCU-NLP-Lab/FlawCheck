{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the Obama Administration by stating that they are \"fighting in court\" to allow non-citizens to vote in general elections. The expert's verdict clarifies that the Obama Administration or Justice Department did not initiate the suit, but rather it was filed by the League of Women Voters and other parties against the Election Assistance Commission.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the Obama Administration is actively fighting to allow non-citizens to vote. The expert's verdict provides more context and sources to support the opposing viewpoint.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions of the Election Assistance Commission would enable non-citizens to legally vote in the 2016 primaries and general election. The expert's verdict clarifies that the current law prohibits non-citizens from registering to vote or voting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions of the Obama Administration or Justice Department. The expert's verdict provides additional information about the lawsuit filed by the League of Women Voters and other parties, suggesting that the Obama Administration's involvement may be limited or indirect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that current law prohibits non-citizens from registering to vote or voting under penalty of perjury. The expert's verdict provides this information to counter the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times.", "Other biases": "None of the other listed biases (falters at times, understate, lack enough support) are present in the claim or expert's verdict."}
