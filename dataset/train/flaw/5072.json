{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the drop in Wisconsin's elementary reading ranking from a top 10 state to 30th in the nation under Tony Evers' watch. The most recent ranking mentioned in the analysis is 25th, not 30th.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only relies on the analysis by the Wisconsin Reading Coalition, a grassroots group of educational advocates. The analysis may not be comprehensive or widely accepted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tony Evers is solely responsible for the drop in Wisconsin's reading ranking, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the drop in Wisconsin's reading ranking, such as changes in educational policies or demographics, that are not considered in the claim."}
