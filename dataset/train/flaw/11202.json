{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the figures regarding the percentage of mass shooters and doctors who are Muslims. The expert mentions that there are no reliable data or citations to verify these statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of mass shooters and doctors who are Muslims can be accurately determined without providing any parameters or timeframe for the claims. This assumption is questionable and lacks clarity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there are alternative explanations and factors that need to be considered when analyzing statistics on mass shootings, such as the varying definitions of mass shootings and the inclusion of non-fatal incidents. This suggests that there may be other factors influencing the statistics, rather than solely the religious affiliation of the perpetrators.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that reliable data do not document the percentage of mass shooters and doctors who are Muslims. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of evidence and reliability in the claim's figures.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the percentage of Muslim mass shooters by only mentioning two incidents (San Bernardino and Chattanooga) where the perpetrators were identified as Muslims. The expert suggests that there may be more incidents where the shooters were Muslims, potentially raising the percentage to 4% or more.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate and verifiable information. The expert's verdict points out the lack of citations, parameters, and reliable data, indicating that the claim may not be consistently reliable or accurate."}
