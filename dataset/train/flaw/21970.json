{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks any evidence or sources to support the statement that two dozen children were sent home from St. Jude's hospital cancer-free in a single week. There is no information or news stories to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a cure for cancer exists and is being suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry, which is a popular conspiracy theory. However, there is no evidence or support for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's investigation contradicts the claim by stating that no news stories or press releases from St. Jude's hospital reported 24 children being released cancer-free in one week.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of finding a cure for cancer by suggesting that it exists but is being suppressed. The expert's statement from St. Jude's hospital explains that the idea of a cure is complicated, and while many children become long-term survivors, there is still ongoing research and treatment being done.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and verifiable information. It relies on a meme without any sources or details, and the expert's investigation found no evidence to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is the false notion of a cure for cancer being suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry, a popular conspiracy theory."}
