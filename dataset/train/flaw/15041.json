{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of taxpayer money that has been spent on sexual harassment settlements for members of Congress. The $17 million figure includes payments for other types of settlements and payments on behalf of employees other than members of Congress over a 21-year period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the $17 million figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the $17 million in settlements is related to sexual harassment claims against Congress members, when in fact it includes a variety of other types of settlements and claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the $17 million figure, such as settlements for discrimination, retaliation, contract disputes, or pay disputes."}
