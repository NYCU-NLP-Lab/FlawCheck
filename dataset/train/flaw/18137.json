{"Understate": "The claim understates the restrictions and measures that were implemented in Kansas City and St. Louis, such as the prohibition of public gatherings and closure of non-essential businesses, in-person churches, and sports events.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that there has never been a time in the history of the country when healthy people have been confined to their homes or only able to do essential things in Kansas City or St. Louis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current stay-at-home orders in Kansas City and St. Louis are unprecedented and have never been implemented before, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations and historical examples, such as the restrictions during the 1918 flu pandemic, that contradict the claim and suggest that similar measures have been taken in the past."}
