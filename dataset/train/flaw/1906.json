{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or references to support the assertion that Mayor Bill de Blasio \"can't open\" the city's schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Mayor Bill de Blasio does not have the authority to open the city's schools, without providing clear evidence or legal analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has the power to override local law and therefore could potentially have the authority to open or close the city's schools.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the legal framework and powers of both the governor and the mayor in relation to opening and closing schools.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the closure of the New York City public schools for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year, indicating that he does have some authority in this matter.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by oversimplifying the power dynamics between the governor and the mayor in determining the opening or closing of schools."}
