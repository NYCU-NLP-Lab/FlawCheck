{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low under Barack Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the population of undocumented people during Obama's presidency directly corresponds to a decrease in illegal immigration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the population of undocumented people, such as increased deportations or changes in immigration policies.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of measuring and tracking illegal immigration by only focusing on the population of undocumented people.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which estimates a growth in the number of unauthorized immigrants during the Obama administration.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Obama's policies on illegal immigration by attributing the decrease solely to his administration's actions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear definition of \"illegal immigration\" and its specific parameters, leaving room for interpretation and confusion."}
