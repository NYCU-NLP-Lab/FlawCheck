{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of job losses in Ohio under President Obama's tenure by stating that \"over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs.\" The actual number of job losses during that time frame was 88,568, which is slightly higher than the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of providing additional data or evidence to explain the reasons behind the job losses or to compare them to other periods.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causation between President Obama's tenure and the job losses in Ohio without considering other factors such as the impact of the Great Recession that started before he took office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job losses, such as the broader economic context of the Great Recession or the fact that job losses in Ohio started before Obama took office.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive picture of the job market in Ohio and failing to acknowledge the larger economic factors that influenced job losses during the specified time frame.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the severity of job losses in Ohio under President Obama's tenure by only focusing on a specific time frame and not considering the overall impact of the Great Recession.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any specific fact, but it may be seen as misleading or not providing the full context of the job losses in Ohio during the specified time frame."}
