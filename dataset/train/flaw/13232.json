{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by using phrases like \"broke into a California bank\" and \"crashing through the ceiling tiles.\" The expert's verdict states that the raccoons fell through the ceiling tiles, but it does not explicitly mention them breaking into the bank.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or details to support how the raccoons broke into the bank. The expert's verdict mentions that the raccoons climbed an outside tree to the roof of the bank and crawled through the air ducts, but it does not provide additional evidence or confirmation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the raccoons intentionally broke into the bank, suggesting a deliberate act. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or confirmation of the raccoons' intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for how the raccoons ended up inside the bank. The expert's verdict suggests that the raccoons may have accidentally entered the bank while exploring or searching for food.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately describing the events by using phrases like \"broke into\" and \"crashing through,\" which may not fully reflect the expert's verdict. The expert's verdict suggests that the raccoons fell through the ceiling tiles but does not explicitly mention them breaking into the bank."}
