{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that Mitt Romney's plan would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class, without providing enough evidence or specifics to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's plan would inherently benefit millionaires and raise taxes on the middle class, without considering any alternative explanations or potential nuances in his tax plan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or detailed information to support the assertion that Mitt Romney's plan specifically targets tax cuts for millionaires and tax increases for the middle class.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or potential counterarguments to Mitt Romney's tax plan, which may include provisions that benefit both the middle class and millionaires in different ways.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mitt Romney has stated he wants lower tax rates for everyone and that people at the high end would still pay the same share of the tax burden they're paying now, suggesting a progressive tax system."}
