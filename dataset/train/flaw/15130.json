{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Confederate battle flag must fly at a height of 30 feet and any changes to its position must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly. This assumption is based on the interpretation of South Carolina's Code of Laws.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Confederate battle flag must fly at a height of 30 feet or that changes to its position require a supermajority vote. It simply states this as a fact without providing further evidence or explanation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff while the Confederate flag remains at full-staff. This indicates that there may be an inconsistency or contradiction in the claim's assertion that changes to the Confederate flag's position require a supermajority vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence or position of the Confederate battle flag, such as historical significance, cultural heritage, or political motivations. It presents the assumption that the flag must fly at a certain height and requires a supermajority vote without exploring other possible reasons for its current status."}
