This suggests that the claim may falter at times in accurately characterizing the nature of stay-at-home orders.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to establish that stay-at-home orders are the law of the states. It relies on the expert's opinion without presenting additional sources or arguments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that stay-at-home orders are the law of the states, without considering alternative perspectives or potential legal challenges to their authority.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding the legality and enforceability of stay-at-home orders. It presents a one-sided perspective that implies the orders are unquestionably the law of the states."}
