{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Clinton that she \"did very well\" with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, and California may be an exaggeration, as the exit poll results show mixed performance in these states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on exit poll results with small sample sizes, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that Clinton may have overlooked examples of winning more youth votes in Oklahoma and Arkansas, which could provide an alternative explanation for her claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it is contradicted by the fact that Clinton performed better among older voters, according to exit poll patterns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that winning or tying with Obama among young voters in two out of three states is a strong performance, without considering the overall context of Obama's popularity among the youth vote.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the performance of Clinton among young voters in California and Massachusetts, where she tied or won a majority of the under 25 vote, according to the exit polls."}
