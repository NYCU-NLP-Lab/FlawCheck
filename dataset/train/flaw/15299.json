{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of Americans who lost their lives to climate change-fueled events by stating that it was \"more than 7,000\" without providing sufficient evidence or support for this specific number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that \"more than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year.\" The source provided refers to a report by Munich RE, but it does not directly attribute the deaths to climate change.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 7,700 deaths attributed to \"global natural loss events\" by Munich RE were caused by climate change. However, Munich RE's head of geo risks research states that they do not have the ability to identify the direct impact of global warming on fatalities caused by natural catastrophes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths attributed to \"global natural loss events.\" Munich RE's report includes a range of natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, storms, floods, landslides, drought, extreme temperatures, and wildfires, without specifically attributing them to climate change.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 7,000 deaths mentioned were not specific to the United States, as initially claimed by the congressman's office. The deaths were globally attributed to natural catastrophes, not solely climate change-fueled events in the United States.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of deaths caused by climate change-fueled events by not providing a clear and accurate estimate or evidence to support the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and clarity due to the initial mistake made by the congressman's office regarding the attribution of the deaths to the United States rather than globally. This raises questions about the reliability and credibility of the claim."}
