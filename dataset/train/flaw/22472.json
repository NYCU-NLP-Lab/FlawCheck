{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the risk of death for Medicaid patients compared to the uninsured.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a single 2011 Wall Street Journal op-ed and disputed by other studies and researchers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being on Medicaid directly leads to a higher likelihood of death, without considering other contributing factors such as the poorer health of Medicaid patients at the start of treatment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the higher likelihood of death for Medicaid patients is due to their poorer health and higher incidence of other risk factors, rather than solely being on Medicaid."}
