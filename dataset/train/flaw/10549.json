The expert's verdict highlights that only a fraction of the workforce is in formal employment, suggesting that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by mentioning that only 3.2 million people actually pay PAYE, indicating that the claim's statement about the workforce may not be accurate or comprehensive."}
