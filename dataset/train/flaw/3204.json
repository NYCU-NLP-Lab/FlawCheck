{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which companies are able to take a tax deduction for moving jobs overseas. The expert's verdict suggests that relocation expenses are deductible, but it does not provide specific evidence or data on the extent of this deduction.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential negative impact of the tax code on offshoring. The expert's verdict mentions that companies get back roughly a third of their expense at the expense of U.S. taxpayers, indicating a potentially significant impact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the tax code permits companies to take a tax deduction for moving jobs overseas. The expert's verdict provides some anecdotal evidence and opinions, but does not provide comprehensive support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax code currently rewards American companies for moving jobs overseas. While the expert's verdict suggests that relocation expenses are deductible, it does not explicitly confirm or refute the existence of a specific tax incentive for offshoring.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why companies may choose to move jobs overseas, such as lower labor costs or access to new markets. The expert's verdict also does not provide alternative explanations, but it does mention that corporation lobbyists argue that the loophole is needed because it creates more jobs."}
