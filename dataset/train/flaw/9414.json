{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Clinton's predecessors used similar email practices. The expert's verdict points out that most of Clinton's predecessors did not regularly use email, and only one, Colin Powell, can be compared to Clinton in this context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Clinton's predecessors did the same thing. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim, stating that most of Clinton's predecessors did not regularly use email.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because some of Clinton's predecessors used personal email addresses, it is the same as her exclusive use of a private server located in her home. The expert's verdict highlights the difference between using a personal email address and hosting an email server, suggesting that this assumption is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Clinton's decision to use a private server, such as wanting to have control over the encryption of her correspondence. This suggests that the claim's assertion that \"my predecessors did the same thing\" may not be the only explanation for her email practices."}
