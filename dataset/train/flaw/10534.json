{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of non-citizens who voted in Texas by stating that 58,000 non-citizens voted, without providing sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that 58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote in Texas are ineligible to vote, without considering the possibility of errors or individuals becoming citizens after obtaining a driver's license.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of non-citizens on the voter registration list, such as errors in data or individuals who became citizens after registering.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of non-citizen voting, as it suggests that the numbers provided are just the \"tip of the iceberg\" without providing further evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state's list is not the final word on how many people have voted illegally, as county officials still need to collect more information and determine citizenship status."}
