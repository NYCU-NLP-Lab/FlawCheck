{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of a 14-year-old girl writing a book on Article 370 by presenting it as a rare and noteworthy event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to prove that the book was actually written by a 14-year-old girl. It relies on tweets and media reports without providing concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the book supports the revocation of Article 370 and portrays it as necessary for peace in Kashmir. This assumption may be problematic as it is not clear if the book actually discusses this topic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be an alternative explanation for the book's content and inspiration. The claim suggests that the 14-year-old girl's father, who is an army officer, has guided and inspired her in writing the book. This alternative explanation challenges the notion that the girl independently wrote the book."}
