{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the progress made in liberating territory from ISIS, as it states that \"very close to 100 percent\" of the territory has been liberated, when the actual reduction is closer to 89-93 percent.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of previous administrations, particularly President Obama, in the success against ISIS. It fails to acknowledge that the campaign to defeat ISIS started before Trump took office and that a significant portion of the progress was made during Obama's presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"very close to 100 percent\" of the territory has been liberated. It only provides data on the reduction in territory controlled by ISIS without specifying the timeframe or the specific territories that were recently held.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the progress made in liberating territory is solely attributed to Trump's actions and strategies, without considering the contributions of previous administrations or coalition forces.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the reduction in territory, such as the contributions of coalition forces, changes in tactics, and the devolution of authority to the tactical level on the battlefield."}
