{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people that Obamacare covers by stating that it covers 24 million fewer people than expected. The expert's verdict shows that the actual number of people covered is higher than the projections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the projected price tag of Obamacare has more than doubled at $2 trillion without providing any evidence or context for this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the projections for Obamacare coverage changed due to the Supreme Court ruling on Medicaid expansion, leading to a different enrollment outcome than initially projected.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that approximately 20 million people are now insured due to the Affordable Care Act, as reported by both sides of the aisle.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the actual number of people covered under Obamacare and by not considering the changes in projections over time.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or expert's verdict."}
