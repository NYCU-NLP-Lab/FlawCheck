{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photos are taken by India's second moon mission Chandrayaan-2 contradicts the fact that Chandrayaan-2 is an unmanned mission.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by presenting the photos as actual images taken by Chandrayaan-2, when in reality they are either doctored images or unrelated images.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the assertion that the photos are from Chandrayaan-2.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the photos are authentic and directly related to Chandrayaan-2, without any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the origin of the photos, such as them being doctored images or unrelated images found online."}
