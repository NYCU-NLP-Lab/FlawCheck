{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of deficit spending and debt spending in Medicare, as it implies that the majority of Medicare expenses are covered through deficit spending or debt.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"the rest\" of Medicare expenses are covered through deficit spending or debt spending. It does not provide specific numbers or percentages to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that deficit spending or debt spending is inherently negative or problematic, without providing any further explanation or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or acknowledge alternative explanations for the financing of Medicare, such as the combination of funding streams mentioned in the expert's verdict. It presents deficit spending and debt spending as the sole sources of funding for the remaining Medicare expenses."}
