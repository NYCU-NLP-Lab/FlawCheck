{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration since it states that Ohio had more soldiers serving in the Union Army per capita than any other state. However, this claim is supported by data from the Ohio Historical Society, which states that Ohio had the highest level of recruits per capita during the Civil War.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by data from the Ohio Historical Society, which states that between 319,000 and 330,000 Ohioans served in the Union Army during the Civil War. However, it is unclear if there are any other sources or studies that provide additional support for this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of Ohioans serving in the Union Army per capita is the most significant measure of a state's contribution during the Civil War. This assumption may be problematic as there could be other factors, such as the number of battles fought or the impact of individual soldiers, that could also be considered when evaluating a state's contribution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explicitly mention any alternative explanations for Ohio having more soldiers serving in the Union Army per capita than any other state. However, it is possible that other states had a higher total number of soldiers but a lower population, which could still make their contribution significant in relation to their population size."}
