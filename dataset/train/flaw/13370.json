{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a preliminary and limited study with a small sample size of only 94 patients, of which only 18 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Later attempts to replicate the study's results have failed or were based on similarly limited sample sizes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that peanut butter can be used as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease based on the correlation between the reduced ability to detect odor in a person's left nostril compared to their right using peanut butter as the source of odor. However, this assumption is not supported by sufficient evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the study's findings by stating that peanut butter can \"change lives and provide an early diagnosis for Alzheimer's.\" The study only demonstrated a correlation between Alzheimer's and reduced odor detection in the left nostril using peanut butter, but it did not establish a definitive diagnostic tool.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations of the study by not acknowledging that it was not large enough to be conclusive and that later attempts to replicate its results have failed or were based on similarly limited sample sizes. This understatement may create a false impression of the study's reliability and generalizability.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduced ability to detect odor in the left nostril of Alzheimer's patients. It assumes that this impairment is specific to Alzheimer's disease, but it does not explore other possible factors or conditions that could contribute to this observation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study's results were not conclusive and that later attempts to replicate them have failed or were based on limited sample sizes. It presents the study as a definitive basis for using peanut butter as a diagnostic tool, which goes against the contradictory evidence and scientific consensus."}
