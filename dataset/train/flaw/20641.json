{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decrease in violent crime during Biden's tenure as vice president, stating it as 15% when it was actually nearly 16%.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in comparing different crime data taken at different time intervals during each presidency, which can lead to a misleading comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the increase in the murder rate under Donald Trump, as it only cites an analysis by crime analyst Jeff Asher without adjusting for population or specifying the rate change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in the murder rate under Donald Trump that are not mentioned in the provided information."}
