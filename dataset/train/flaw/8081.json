{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in murder rate by stating a 52 percent increase, which does not accurately reflect the data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Andrew Gillum oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in murder rate can be solely attributed to Gillum's oversight, without considering other factors or individuals involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in murder rate, such as societal factors or changes in law enforcement strategies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of murders during Gillum's tenure as mayor has remained relatively stable, ranging from 11 to 17 deaths in four years.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying the responsibility of Gillum as mayor in addressing the murder rate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its attempt to attribute full responsibility to Gillum, as the mayor of Tallahassee operates under a weak mayor form of government and is just one vote on the commission."}
