The claim presents the photo as evidence of a baby's rescue from a plane crash, while the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that the photo is from a different incident entirely.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not related to a plane crash in 2021. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the photo is from a boat accident in 2018.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the photo is related to a recent plane crash in Indonesia. However, this assumption is problematic as the expert's verdict reveals that the photo is unrelated to any plane crash.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understating bias in this claim."}
