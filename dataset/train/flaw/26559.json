{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the value of U.S. agricultural exports to China by stating it was \"$16 or $17 billion\" when it was actually nearly $26 billion in 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the stated value of U.S. agricultural exports to China.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual \"all-time high\" for U.S. agricultural exports to China was not \"$16 or $17 billion\" but nearly $26 billion in 2012.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the potential impact of the tentative trade deal will be significant based on the exaggerated value of U.S. agricultural exports.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misstating the record value of exports and presenting misleading figures for the \"all-time high\" and the lowest point of China's purchase of U.S. agricultural goods.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by experts that the low figures for China's purchase of U.S. agricultural goods in 2002 were due to China becoming a member of the World Trade Organization, rather than a deliberate decrease in purchases."}
