{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that \"every former North Carolina governor opposes\" the proposed constitutional amendments. The expert's verdict mentions that while all former governors made news recently for opposing the amendments that affect the governor's office, it does not explicitly state that every single former governor opposes all six amendments.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that every former North Carolina governor opposes the constitutional amendments. The expert's verdict mentions that while all former governors made news recently for opposing the amendments that affect the governor's office, it does not provide specific evidence or statements from each individual governor to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the opposition of a few former governors represents the stance of all former governors. The expert's verdict mentions that while all former governors made news recently for opposing the amendments that affect the governor's office, it does not provide evidence or statements from each individual governor to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the opposition of the former governors. The expert's verdict mentions that the amendments that affect the governor's office were the ones opposed by the former governors, but it does not explore other possible reasons for their opposition.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the support for the proposed constitutional amendments by stating that every former governor opposes them. The expert's verdict mentions that former Governor Pat McCrory reaffirmed his support for some of the amendments, such as voter ID, victims' rights, tax cap, and hunting and fishing. This suggests that there may be former governors who support at least some of the amendments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that former Governor Pat McCrory supports some of the proposed constitutional amendments, such as voter ID, victims' rights, tax cap, and hunting and fishing. The expert's verdict mentions McCrory's support for these amendments, which contradicts the claim that every former governor opposes all six amendments."}
