{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the authors of the report never interviewed a single CIA official is not supported by evidence or specific details.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that conducting face-to-face interviews with CIA officials is necessary for producing a comprehensive report.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The report explains that CIA employees and contractors were under potential legal jeopardy, which prevented them from appearing before the committee.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Marco Rubio falters in accurately portraying the efforts made by the committee to gather information and conduct the investigation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the reasons why face-to-face interviews were not conducted, such as potential legal issues and the unlikelihood of cooperation from CIA employees.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that then-CIA Director Michael Hayden did testify before the committee, although the committee deemed his testimony less than entirely helpful."}
