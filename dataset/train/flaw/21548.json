{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton opposed sanctions against Russia because of speaking fees her husband received from a Russian bank. The only evidence provided is a partial email that does not directly link the speaking fees to Clinton's opposition to the Magnitsky Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the speaking fees received by Bill Clinton from a Russian bank influenced Hillary Clinton's stance on sanctions against Russia. However, this assumption is not substantiated by any concrete evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the email by suggesting that it proves the Clinton campaign used undue influence to kill a Bloomberg story about the incident. The email only mentions that the campaign team helped in preventing the story from being published, but it does not provide any details or evidence of undue influence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a coherent and logical argument linking the speaking fees to Hillary Clinton's opposition to the Magnitsky Act. It relies on innuendo and a single email without providing a clear and direct connection between the two.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Fox News story, which initially reported the claim, was later retracted and debunked. This raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Hillary Clinton's opposition to the Magnitsky Act that are not addressed in the claim. Without considering other factors or motivations, the claim presents a biased view of the situation."}
