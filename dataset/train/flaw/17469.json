{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Kamala Harris' stance on prostitution by stating that she wants to legalize it, when in fact she only expressed support for decriminalization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to substantiate the assertion that Kamala Harris wants to legalize prostitution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kamala Harris' support for decriminalization of sex work automatically translates to wanting to legalize prostitution, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kamala Harris did not explicitly state that she wants to legalize sex work or prostitution, but rather expressed support for its decriminalization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Kamala Harris supports the decriminalization of sex work as a means to protect the rights and safety of those involved, rather than advocating for its legalization."}
