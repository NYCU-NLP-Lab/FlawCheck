{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of participants in the march by stating that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Kashmiris took to the streets, when in reality it was a funeral procession.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the video is related to the revocation of article 370 or the women's march in Kashmir.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is evidence of a rally to liberate Kashmir from India, without verifying the context or source of the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video is actually from a funeral procession in Hajin area of North Kashmir, which has no connection to the recent developments in Kashmir after article 370 was revoked."}
