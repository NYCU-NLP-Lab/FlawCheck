{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that President Biden signed \"blank executive orders,\" implying that the orders were completely empty or devoid of any content.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the executive orders signed by President Biden were indeed blank or invalid.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing Biden signing the executive orders with seemingly blank pages is evidence of their invalidity, without considering alternative explanations or further investigation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The provided expert analysis suggests that the low-quality video and overexposure may have made it difficult to discern any writing on the pages. Higher quality images from the same event show that there were indeed printed words on the pages, contradicting the claim's assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Biden signed a series of executive orders after his inauguration, as confirmed by multiple sources and images."}
