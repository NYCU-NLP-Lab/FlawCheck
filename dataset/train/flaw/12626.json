{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Phyllis Schlafly said, \"There will be a woman president over my dead body\" is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that there is no evidence she ever said such a thing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or quote provided to verify that Phyllis Schlafly made the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Phyllis Schlafly held a strong opposition to a woman becoming president, but the expert's verdict mentions that she openly endorsed a female presidential candidate, Michele Bachmann.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the quote attributed to Schlafly is fabricated and not something she actually said."}
