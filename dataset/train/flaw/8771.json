{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in benefits and wages between federal employees and the private sector. The expert's verdict mentions that federal civil servants received an average pay and benefits of $123,049 while private workers made $61,051 in total compensation. However, it is not clear if this difference is significant enough to \"far outstrip\" the market rates of the private sector.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that federal employees' benefits and wages far outstrip the market rates of the private sector. The provided information includes some data from 2009 and 2008, but it may not be comprehensive or up-to-date enough to draw a definitive conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is an injustice between federal government and private sector employees regarding benefits and wages. However, this assumption may not be universally agreed upon and can be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that officials from public employee unions and some economists dismiss the compensation comparisons, arguing that the gap reflects the skill and education requirements for federal jobs and the outsourcing of lower-paying jobs to the private sector. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the observed differences in benefits and wages."}
