{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job may be an exaggeration if the calculation does not accurately reflect the actual cost and number of jobs created.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support if the calculation of $278,000 per job is based on individual interpretation and not on concrete data or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of the stimulus can be directly attributed to the creation of each job, which may be a problematic assumption as there are various factors and variables involved in job creation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the cost per job calculation, such as different methods of analysis or different ways of categorizing stimulus spending."}
