{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Secretary of State John Kerry that the nuclear agreement with Iran \"never sunsets\" exaggerates the extent to which the agreement restricts Iran's nuclear activities.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that several provisions of the agreement do expire over time, which could potentially allow Iran more freedom in its nuclear pursuits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the provisions in the agreement that do have time limits, indicating that there are indeed sunsets in the agreement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of specific time limits for certain provisions means that the agreement never sunsets, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Secretary Kerry's statement was meant to emphasize the long-term monitoring and restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, rather than the specific expiration of certain provisions."}
