{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"LOL\" means \"Lucifer Our Lord\" and is used in prayer by Satanists lacks sufficient evidence or support. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no mention or documentation of such a connotation pre-dating the rumor's first appearance. Additionally, extensive research on the etymology of \"LOL\" prior to 2011, when it was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary, does not reveal any connection to \"Lucifer our lord.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the abbreviation \"LOL\" has a hidden occult meaning linked with Satanism. This assumption is not supported by any credible evidence or research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the origin and meaning of \"LOL,\" such as its use as an abbreviation for \"laughing out loud\" in the context of text messaging, e-mail, and social media. These alternative explanations contradict the claim that it has a sinister or satanic connotation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that \"LOL\" is widely accepted and recognized as an abbreviation for \"laughing out loud.\" The expert's verdict mentions that it is one of the most commonly used and oldest exemplars of Internet slang abbreviations, officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2011.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance and implications of the abbreviation \"LOL\" by associating it with Satanism and suggesting that it is used in prayer by Satanists. There is no credible evidence to support such an exaggerated claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any biases that understate the claim."}
