{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Dwight Holton has worked in federal court in Oregon, which is still a legal setting within the state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that only experience in state courtrooms qualifies someone to be Attorney General, which may be a problematic assumption as federal court experience can also be relevant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be interpreted differently, with Rosenblum arguing that Holton's lack of experience in state courtrooms makes him less qualified for the position of Attorney General."}
