{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"youth unemployment is through the roof\" may be an exaggeration as it is not supported by the evidence presented in the expert's verdict. The expert states that youth unemployment is not rising, historically high, or high compared to other wealthy countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts the claim. The expert states that youth unemployment is not unusually high and that the overall unemployment rate has been decreasing since 2010.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that youth unemployment is a major issue without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict suggests that there are other concerns, such as the rising cost of education and student debt, that young people find more important.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the claim, such as young people taking longer to find work and the different ways unemployment figures are measured. This indicates that there may be alternative explanations for the claim of high youth unemployment."}
