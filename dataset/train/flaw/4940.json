{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the threat made by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by stating that he \"threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against\" changes to bargaining laws. The expert's analysis suggests that while Walker did mention the possibility of calling on the National Guard in case of disruptive job actions, it is not clear if he specifically threatened to use them to impose his will or suppress protests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Walker threatened to call out the National Guard in response to protests. The expert's analysis mentions that the progressive committee cited three news stories, but none of them directly quoted Walker making such a threat.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Walker's mention of contingency plans, including the National Guard, implies a threat to use force against protesters. However, the expert's analysis suggests that this assumption may be problematic as Walker's exact words and intentions are not clear.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. Walker's mention of the National Guard. The expert's analysis suggests that Walker's reference to contingency plans may have been a response to a reporter's question rather than a direct threat."}
