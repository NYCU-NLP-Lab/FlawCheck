{"Contradict fact": "The claim initially states that the man in Pompeii was killed after being struck by a large slab of stone. However, the expert's verdict and the provided information clarify that the man's cause of death was asphyxiation caused by the pyroclastic flow, not the impact of the stone block. Therefore, the claim contradicts this fact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the man was killed by a large slab of stone.

Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man's death was caused by being struck by a large slab of stone. However, the expert's verdict and the provided information indicate that this initial assumption was incorrect. The assumption made in the claim is problematic because it does not align with the available evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict and the provided information offer an alternative explanation for the man's cause of death, which is asphyxiation caused by the pyroclastic flow. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that the man was killed by a large slab of stone."}
