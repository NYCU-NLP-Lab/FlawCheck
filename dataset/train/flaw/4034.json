{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of India's role in the fight against coronavirus by stating that Switzerland's Matterhorn mountain was lighted up with the Indian National flag to acknowledge India's leadership in the fight against the virus. The expert's verdict clarifies that the projection of the Indian flag was to express solidarity to all Indians in the fight against COVID-19, not specifically in recognition of India's leadership.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that India is leading in the fight against coronavirus. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is false and provides evidence from the official Indian embassy's tweet and the tourism website of Zermatt Matterhorn to support their conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the projection of the Indian flag on Switzerland's Matterhorn mountain was a direct result of India supplying HCQ tablets to the country. However, the expert's verdict states that this claim is false and clarifies that the projection was done to express solidarity, not as a result of India's supply of HCQ tablets.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the projection of the Indian flag on Matterhorn mountain, stating that it was done to express solidarity to all Indians in the fight against COVID-19. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that it was done to acknowledge India's leadership in the fight against the virus."}
