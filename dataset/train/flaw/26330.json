{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the damage by stating that the MTN office in Apapa, Lagos was burnt down in a reprisal attack, when in fact, a spokesman for MTN Nigeria stated that there was no fire or reprisal attack at their Apapa office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the MTN office in Apapa, Lagos was actually burnt down. The only evidence provided is a tweet with two photos, but the photos' authenticity and relevance to the claim are questionable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos shared on social media and blogs accurately depict a reprisal attack on the MTN office in Apapa, Lagos. However, there is no concrete evidence or verification of the photos' authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photos, such as the possibility that they were taken in a different location or during a different incident, as suggested by the comments underneath the tweet."}
