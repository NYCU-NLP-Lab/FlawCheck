{"Lack enough support": "The claim that 15,000 IRS employees \"have to be added to administer \u2018ObamaCare\u2019 and look at the tax implications\" lacks sufficient support as the IRS has not settled on a number or done its own jobs estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a specific number of IRS employees is required to administer 'ObamaCare' and assess tax implications without providing substantial evidence or justification.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the potential number of IRS employees needed as other estimates range from 16,000 to 20,000 additional agents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or perspectives on the number of IRS employees needed to administer 'ObamaCare' and analyze tax implications, as different sources provide varying estimates."}
