{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that the average cost of regulations for small manufacturers with fewer than 50 employees is $34,000 per employee. This figure is higher than the average among all manufacturing companies and all U.S. businesses.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is based on a report commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers, some critics have questioned the methodology and accuracy of the study. The claim may lack sufficient support to be considered completely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of regulations is a significant factor in small manufacturers' decision to relocate or go out of business. This assumption may be problematic as there could be other factors influencing their decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that reducing regulatory influence would make it easier for small manufacturers to stay in business. However, there may be alternative explanations for the challenges faced by small manufacturers, such as market competition or economic factors."}
