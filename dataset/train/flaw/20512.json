{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which teams are spending their dollars on the offensive side of football. The expert's verdict provides evidence that there is a trend towards prioritizing offenses, but it does not establish that the majority of teams are currently spending the majority of their money on offense.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that the majority of teams are now spending their dollars on offense. The expert's verdict offers some anecdotal evidence and opinions, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of team spending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trend towards prioritizing offense is solely due to the advantage given to offenses by NFL policies and rules. It does not consider other factors that could influence team spending decisions, such as the performance of specific players or the strategies employed by different teams.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the trend towards prioritizing offense. It solely attributes the shift to the advantage given to offenses by NFL policies and rules, without considering other potential factors such as changes in coaching philosophies or the increased importance of passing in the modern game.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on the opinions and analysis of one expert, Mark Schlereth, without providing a broader range of perspectives or evidence. The expert's verdict is based on Schlereth's personal experience and observations, which may not be representative of the entire NFL.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which teams are spending on offense compared to defense. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the majority of teams are indeed spending more on offense than defense, with a total spending of $1.7 billion on offense compared to $1.6 billion on defense for the 2013-14 year.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any established facts. The expert's verdict provides some evidence to support the claim that teams are spending more on offense, but it does not contradict any established facts."}
