{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of right-to-work laws on wages by only mentioning a 4.1 percent difference in per-capita personal incomes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one source, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, which is a \"free market\" think tank known for supporting right-to-work laws.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher per-capita personal incomes in right-to-work states directly correlate to employees making more money.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in wages, such as the impact of other economic factors or the presence of different industries in right-to-work states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of a study conducted by economists from the Economic Policy Institute, which states that wages in right-to-work states are actually 3.2 percent lower than in non-right-to-work states.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting evidence and opinions on the impact of right-to-work laws on wages and job growth."}
