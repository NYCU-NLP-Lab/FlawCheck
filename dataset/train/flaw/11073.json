{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"public trust in our election system is at an all-time low\" lacks sufficient data and evidence to support it. The expert mentions that there isn't much national data to compare trust in elections over time, and there's no specific data for North Carolina.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that public trust in the election system is at an all-time low without providing substantial evidence. This assumption may not be accurate due to the lack of comprehensive data.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of trust in the election system by implying that it is at an all-time low. The expert mentions that Gallup's most recent poll found that 70 percent of Americans were \"very or somewhat confident\" in the accuracy of votes in the 2018 midterm elections, which is slightly higher than previous years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that confidence in elections may vary depending on political party affiliation and the party occupying the White House. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that trust in the election system is uniformly low.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gallup's poll results actually show a slight increase in confidence in election accuracy compared to previous years. The claim of an all-time low in public trust in the election system is not supported by the available data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment of public trust in the election system. The expert's analysis highlights the limitations and inconsistencies in available data, making it difficult to make a definitive judgment on the level of trust."}
