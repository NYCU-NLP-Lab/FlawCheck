{"Understates": "The claim may understate the impact of the government shutdown on people making applications for benefits like Social Security or Medicare. The expert's verdict mentions that the shutdown has led to staff shortages and furloughs, which could potentially impact the processing of applications and services.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the government shutdown \"does damage to all kinds of people\" making applications for benefits. It lacks sufficient support to validate the broad claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government shutdown directly affects the processing of applications for benefits, without providing concrete evidence or examples to support this assumption. It may be problematic to make such a general assumption without specific information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the impact of the government shutdown, such as staff shortages and furloughs. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for any potential damage to people making applications for benefits, beyond just the shutdown itself."}
