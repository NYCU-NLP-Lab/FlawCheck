{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money the U.S. spends on its military by stating that it is more than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined. The expert's verdict shows that the U.S. spends as much as the next eight countries combined, not the next 16.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the U.S. spends more than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined. The expert's verdict provides data from two credible sources that show the U.S. spends as much as the next eight countries combined, not 16.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. military budget is larger than the combined budgets of the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. However, the expert's verdict shows that this assumption is incorrect, as the U.S. spends as much as the next eight countries combined, not 16.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the comparison between the U.S. military budget and the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. The expert's verdict provides data that show the U.S. spends as much as the next eight countries combined, suggesting that the claim is not accurate."}
