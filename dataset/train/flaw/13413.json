{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows Azerbaijani police arresting residents during the 2020 military conflict. The video has been circulating since at least 2019 and does not specifically depict events from the 2020 conflict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is related to the 2020 military conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption, and the video's origin and context suggest it is unrelated to the conflict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it was originally published on YouTube with a caption indicating it shows \"police violence and insults to protesters\" during a rally. This suggests that the video may depict a different incident unrelated to the military conflict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video has been circulating since at least 2019, predating the 2020 military conflict. This undermines the claim's assertion that the video is related to the conflict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the video has been debunked as false. The expert's verdict clearly states that the claim is false, indicating a significant discrepancy between the claim and the truth.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it does not make any overstated or hyperbolic claims."}
