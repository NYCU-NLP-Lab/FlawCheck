{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that no Americans have died from the flu in 2020. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim, stating that more than 7,500 Americans have died from the flu between January 5 and May 9, 2020.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of flu deaths in 2020 by stating that no Americans have died from the flu. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim, stating that more than 7,500 Americans have died from the flu between January 5 and May 9, 2020.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that no Americans have died from the flu in 2020. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics that flu fatalities are tracked and estimated, indicating that deaths from the flu do occur.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that no Americans have died from the flu in 2020, without considering the data and evidence provided by the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics. The expert's verdict highlights the importance of interpreting illness data cautiously and provides evidence of flu deaths during the specified time period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the absence of reported flu deaths in 2020. The expert's verdict mentions that COVID-19 may be affecting whether patients seek healthcare, potentially leading to lower reporting of flu cases and deaths."}
