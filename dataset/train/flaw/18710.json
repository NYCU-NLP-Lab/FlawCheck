{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which non-citizens control the informal economy by stating that 70% of it is in their hands, while the evidence suggests a much lower percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 70% of the informal economy is controlled by non-citizens.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ownership and control of spaza shops accurately represent the overall informal sector, which experts argue is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of non-citizens in the informal economy, such as economic opportunities or specific market dynamics, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the most recent data, which shows that only around 20% of the informal sector's workforce consists of migrants from outside South Africa.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the diversity and complexity of the informal economy by focusing solely on the ownership of spaza shops and not considering other types of informal businesses."}
