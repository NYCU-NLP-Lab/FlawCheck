{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the security footage, presenting it as \"smoking gun\" evidence of fraud.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the testimony and investigation findings of Frances Watson, the chief investigator in the office of Georgia's secretary of state, who stated that there were no mystery ballots brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that fraud occurred based on the security footage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of suitcases filled with ballots indicates fraudulent activity, without considering alternative explanations or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The investigation found that the suitcases were packed up because the workers thought they were done for the night and were closing up, and they were later opened to continue counting the ballots."}
