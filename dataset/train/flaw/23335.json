{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific historical periods or examples to support the assertion that there is a long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices. The expert's verdict mentions that Cruz's office did not provide any specific detail or historical period to back the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current composition of eight justices is consistent with historical precedent without providing sufficient evidence or examples.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Democrats argue that the court needs a full contingent of nine justices to settle legal disputes of consequence, suggesting that there is an alternative explanation to the claim."}
