{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documentation to support the assertion that Congressman John Lewis did not pay property taxes on his townhouse.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of property tax payments in one year implies a consistent failure to pay property taxes, without considering alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from Lewis's spokeswoman, who confirmed that he pays property taxes annually and is up to date with his payments.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the alleged non-payment of property taxes by referring to Lewis's \"fancy\" million-dollar townhouse and suggesting that it reflects negatively on his credibility.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a table that does not clearly support the assertion that Lewis did not pay property taxes, as it only shows the most recent payment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the legal notice of a court action, such as the case being dismissed or resolved in favor of Congressman Lewis.", "Understate": "None of the biases suggest an understatement in this claim."}
