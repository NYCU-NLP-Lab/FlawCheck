{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Senator Kamala Harris is the aunt of actor Jussie Smollett lacks substantial evidence. The only evidence presented is that Smollett's mother and Harris share a surname, which is not sufficient to prove a familial relationship.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sharing a last name automatically indicates a familial relationship. However, the surname \"Harris\" is a common name in the United States, and there is no evidence to suggest a direct connection between Kamala Harris and Jussie Smollett.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by providing evidence that Kamala Harris and Jussie Smollett do not have any familial connection through marriage or shared ancestry.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of evidence and the unlikelihood of a familial relationship between Kamala Harris and Jussie Smollett. The expert's verdict emphasizes that their family branches simply do not intersect, indicating a significant absence of evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may be a conspiracy theory or rumor circulated on social media, indicating the existence of alternative explanations for the claim."}
