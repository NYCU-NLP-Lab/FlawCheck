{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in terms of stating that the police \"removed\" the amputee's prosthetic legs, as the footage suggests that the legs were grabbed by protesters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that the police removed the amputee's prosthetic legs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the police intentionally removed the amputee's prosthetic legs, but it is unclear from the available information whether this was intentional or unintentional.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by eyewitnesses, who claimed that the prosthetics came loose when a police officer grabbed the protester by his ankles.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times due to conflicting accounts and lack of clear information about what happened after the amputee was pulled away by protesters."}
