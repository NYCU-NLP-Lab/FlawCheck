{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Sen. Robert Gordon's actions by stating that he \"cost us money\" and \"stuck us with the bill.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the property tax exemption for the Newark sports arena did not directly affect the target audience of the ad.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to show a direct link between Sen. Robert Gordon's actions and the financial impact on the voters in Bergen and Passaic counties.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the property tax exemption for the Newark sports arena is a negative action by Sen. Robert Gordon. However, the expert's verdict includes a statement from Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres, who argues that the tax exemption is appropriate because the arena property is publicly owned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the property tax exemption, suggesting that if the property were not exempt, the Newark Housing Authority would have to use tax dollars to afford the taxes on the property. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Sen. Robert Gordon's actions solely resulted in costing taxpayers money."}
