However, the claim may still be considered exaggerated as it implies that all the deaths were due to farmers' negligence, whereas the expert's verdict explains that the deaths were primarily caused by the storm's extreme weather conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that farmers were negligent in taking care of their animals.

However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that farmers did try to protect their animals but were unable to do so due to the extreme conditions created by the winter storm.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the deaths of the cows. The expert's verdict provides the alternative explanation that the deaths were primarily caused by the extreme weather conditions and the winds associated with the winter storm."}
