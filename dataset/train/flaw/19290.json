{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"all living former presidents\" have refused to attend Donald Trump's inauguration, when in fact only some of them have made their attendance uncertain.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that former presidents skipping their successors' inaugurations is not uncommon and has happened in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the statement that all living former presidents have refused to attend.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the potential absence of other former presidents would be a \"snub of presidential proportions,\" which is a subjective and problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential absence of former presidents, such as health reasons or personal decisions."}
