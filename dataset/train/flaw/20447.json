{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of NAFTA on trade between the US and Mexico. While it is true that trade has increased significantly since the implementation of NAFTA, the claim implies that all of this growth is solely due to the trade agreement, which may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that NAFTA is solely responsible for the increase in trade between the US and Mexico. It would require more evidence to establish a direct causal link between NAFTA and the trade growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative factors or explanations for the increase in trade between the US and Mexico. It attributes all the growth to NAFTA without acknowledging other potential factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that trade between the US and Mexico was not only $50 billion before NAFTA, but it was actually higher. The expert's analysis shows that trade in 1993, the year before NAFTA, was around $81.5 billion.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the potential benefits of NAFTA by attributing all the trade growth to the agreement. The expert's analysis suggests that while NAFTA has contributed to the increase in trade, it may not be solely responsible for it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in trade between the US and Mexico is inherently positive and should be liked by everyone. It does not consider potential negative consequences or impacts of the increased trade.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately presenting the facts and data related to trade between the US and Mexico before NAFTA. It states that trade was around $50 billion, which contradicts the expert's analysis showing it was higher."}
