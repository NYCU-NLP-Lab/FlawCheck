{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the darkness in Utqiagvik during the winter.

The expert's verdict, however, provides information from The Washington Post and the National Weather Service of Fairbanks, Alaska, which supports the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the extended period without sunlight in Utqiagvik during the winter. However, the expert's verdict explains that this phenomenon is due to the \"polar night\" caused by Earth's tilt on its axis.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any known facts. The expert's verdict confirms that the information in the claim is largely accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the extent of the darkness in Utqiagvik during the winter. The expert's verdict confirms that the town experiences a \"polar night\" and the sun does not rise for an extended period.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times. The expert's verdict supports the accuracy of the claim."}
