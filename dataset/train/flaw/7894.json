{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that no one has been killed at a gun show, which is not true as there have been incidents of accidental shootings resulting in deaths at gun shows.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that no one has been killed at a gun show.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of deaths at gun shows proves that guns do not kill people, which is a problematic assumption as it ignores other factors such as gun regulations and the actions of individuals.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been incidents of accidental shootings resulting in deaths at gun shows, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the degree of violence associated with gun shows is dictated by gun regulations in the states they are held in, rather than the presence of guns at the shows. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that guns do not kill people."}
