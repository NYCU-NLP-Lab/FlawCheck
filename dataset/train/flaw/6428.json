{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Craigslist ad has expired or been taken down, making it difficult to tie it to any official rally or political event. There is a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Craigslist ad was seeking actors to hold \"Pro Trump\" signs during protest activity at or near the Phoenix Convention Center. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that similar posts seeking actors have been covered by the news media in the past, including posts related to the Democratic National Convention and President Trump's rally. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the Craigslist ad, such as actors being sought for other purposes.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that a similar Craigslist ad mysteriously appeared and disappeared before a Trump rally in 2017, and that the Trump rally in October 2018 was held nearly 20 miles away from the Convention Center. This contradicts the claim that the Craigslist ad was specifically related to a Trump event at the Phoenix Convention Center.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to contact the poster or find the person mentioned in the ad, Steve Trig. This indicates that the information provided in the ad may not be reliable or verifiable.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
