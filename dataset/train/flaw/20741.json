{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Julian Castro exaggerates the job losses in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by comparing March figures with July figures, rather than using the more recent and accurate August figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a cherry-picked month-to-month comparison that does not provide a comprehensive view of the job trends in the states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing July figures instead of August figures is a better measurement, despite the fact that August numbers are available and will be revised before being made official.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the job gains in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, as shown by the August figures, contradict Castro's claim of job losses."}
