{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the tax cut by stating that the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut. The expert's verdict mentions that this figure is an overstatement, although it is less exaggerated compared to other Republicans' claims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut. The source of this information is the House Ways and Means Committee, but no further details or data are provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax cut will benefit all average American families of four equally. However, it fails to consider individual circumstances, such as income level, deductions, and other factors that may affect the actual tax cut amount for different families.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the tax cut as the sole reason for the $1,182 reduction in taxes for the average American family of four. However, there may be other factors or changes in the tax code that contribute to this reduction, which are not mentioned or explored in the claim."}
