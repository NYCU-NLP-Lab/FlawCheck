{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of job loss in New Jersey by stating that the state is \"down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the state actually lost more than 205,000 jobs, which is a slightly higher number.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the job growth that has occurred since Governor Christie took office. The expert's verdict mentions that the state has gained more than 38,000 jobs since February 2010, which is not mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify the statement that \"New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment\" for 12 consecutive months. The expert's verdict mentions that more recent figures show job growth and the state's unemployment rate was not statistically different than the national rate at the time of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Governor Christie is more focused on creating additional wealth for his friends and backers in the One Percent than creating jobs for New Jersey residents. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence and could be seen as problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job loss and unemployment rates in New Jersey, such as the impact of the national recession or other economic factors."}
