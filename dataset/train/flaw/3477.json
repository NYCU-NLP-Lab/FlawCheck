{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the role of President Obama in designating Soleimani as a terrorist, as it implies that Obama did nothing about it.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actions taken by President Obama in designating Soleimani as a terrorist, as it fails to acknowledge the Treasury Department's designations and the reasons behind them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that President Obama \"didn't do anything about it\" regarding Soleimani's designation as a terrorist.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama had the same level of authority and responsibility as President Trump in taking action against Soleimani, without considering the different geopolitical contexts and circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for why President Obama did not capture or kill Soleimani after his designation, such as political considerations and the potential risks involved."}
