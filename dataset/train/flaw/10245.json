{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama's finance team is recommending a \"1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that it is actually a proposal by a Pennsylvania congressman and not a recommendation from President Obama or his team.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that President Obama's finance team is recommending the tax.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed tax is endorsed by President Obama's finance team, which is not supported by the expert's verdict."}
