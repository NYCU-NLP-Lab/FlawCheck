{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by Thomas Homer-Dixon and presents it as a blanket statement that wind turbines never recoup the energy it takes to build them, while the expert's verdict clarifies that some windmills can recoup their construction costs in three years or less.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that wind turbines never recoup the energy it takes to build them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that all wind turbines are unable to recoup the energy it takes to build them, which is a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict highlights that some windmills can indeed achieve energy payback in a relatively short period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for wind turbines recouping their construction costs, while the expert's verdict acknowledges that a windmill situated in a good location can pay back the energy costs of creating it in under three years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some wind turbines can indeed generate as much energy as was invested in building them, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading and cherry-picked version of what Thomas Homer-Dixon actually said, as clarified by the expert's verdict."}
