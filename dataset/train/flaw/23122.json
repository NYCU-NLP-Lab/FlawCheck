{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences or penalties that can result from an ethics case, as there are other punishments besides formal sanctions that can be levied.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that in every ethics case resulting in a formal sanction, an investigative subcommittee is always established first. The evidence provided only shows that this is the case for the most severe types of punishments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of an investigative subcommittee means that serious repercussions are unlikely, which may be a problematic assumption as there are other factors that can influence the outcome of an ethics case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the absence of an investigative subcommittee, such as the House Ethics Committee dismissing the complaint or conducting its own investigation without a referral from the Office of Congressional Ethics."}
