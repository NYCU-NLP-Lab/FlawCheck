The expert's verdict indicates that this is not always the case and depends on the individual candidate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that it is fair for Charlie Crist and his wife to release their tax returns because Rick Scott and his wife have done so. The expert's verdict questions the fairness of this assumption and suggests that it is subjective.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that candidates for governor routinely disclose their spouses' tax returns. The expert's verdict provides historical context and examples, but it does not provide concrete evidence for routine disclosure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that Charlie Crist is hiding something by not releasing his spouse's tax returns. The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for why candidates choose not to disclose their spouses' tax returns, such as privacy concerns or political strategy."}
