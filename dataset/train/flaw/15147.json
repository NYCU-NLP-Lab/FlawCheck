{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating McCain's stance on occupying Iraq indefinitely against their wishes. The expert's verdict highlights that the United States and the United Nations do not consider the current U.S. presence in Iraq as an \"occupation\" and that McCain has indicated he would leave if the Iraqi government asked the U.S. to do so.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely, even if the Iraqi government asked the U.S. to leave. However, the expert's verdict mentions that McCain has stated that if a sovereign Iraqi government asked the U.S. to leave, it would be obvious that they would have to leave.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely against their wishes. The expert's verdict mentions that McCain has not expressed a desire to stay in Iraq against the wishes of the Iraqi government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for McCain's stance on Iraq. The expert's verdict mentions that Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, have expressed support for a withdrawal timetable, indicating that there are alternative approaches to the U.S. presence in Iraq."}
