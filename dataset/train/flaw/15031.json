{"Lack enough support": "The claim that using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to fund a new downtown sports arena is not feasible under state law lacks enough support. The expert provides information about the current state of the cigarette tax and the possibility of changing it through legislative approval.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of a surcharge on the cigarette tax is not feasible under state law. However, the expert points out that it would require the approval of the Legislature and governor to change the tax structure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the mayor's statement about the feasibility of using a surcharge on the cigarette tax may be referring to the fact that there is currently no provision for local surcharges or directing the tax money to local projects. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that it is not feasible under state law."}
