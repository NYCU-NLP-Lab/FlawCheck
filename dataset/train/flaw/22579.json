{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo used to depict Muslims celebrating Ramadan during COVID-19 was actually taken in August 2019, months before the pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a misleading photo and does not provide any evidence of Muslims breaching social distancing during Ramadan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo accurately represents the situation during Ramadan and implies that Muslims are not following social distancing guidelines, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo was taken during a different event (Eid al-Fitr) and not during Ramadan, which undermines the claim's argument."}
