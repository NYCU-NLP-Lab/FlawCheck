{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the photographs by implying that they show a single Nazi rally when they actually depict different rallies held at Madison Square Garden throughout the 1930s.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the photographs show a Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in 1939.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the assumption that the photographs circulating online in February 2020 are all from the same rally, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the photographs, such as the possibility that they depict different events or rallies unrelated to Nazism."}
