{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the success rate of immigrant-owned businesses by stating that they \"grow those businesses more successfully.\" The evidence provided only shows that immigrants are more likely to start businesses, not necessarily that they are more successful in growing them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that immigrants are more successful at growing businesses. The evidence provided only focuses on the higher rate of business start-ups by immigrants, but does not provide comprehensive data on the success or growth of those businesses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the higher rate of business start-ups by immigrants automatically translates to greater success in growing those businesses. However, the evidence provided does not directly address the success or growth of immigrant-owned businesses, except within a specific subset of venture-backed firms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher rate of business start-ups by immigrants. The evidence provided suggests that immigrant entrepreneurs may face challenges in growing their businesses, such as smaller average business sizes compared to non-immigrant businesses.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the success and growth of immigrant-owned businesses. The evidence provided only focuses on a specific subset of venture-backed firms and does not provide a complete picture of the overall success of immigrant entrepreneurs.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential challenges and limitations faced by immigrant entrepreneurs. The evidence provided suggests that immigrant-owned businesses may be smaller on average compared to non-immigrant businesses, indicating potential limitations in growth and success.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the success of immigrant-owned businesses is not as clear as the start-up data suggests. The evidence provided includes statements from experts highlighting the lack of clarity and comprehensive analysis on the success and growth of immigrant-owned businesses."}
