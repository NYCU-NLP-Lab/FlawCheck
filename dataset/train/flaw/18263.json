{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Maxine Waters told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to \"impeach Donald Trump.\" The meme aims to make it look like Waters actually said that, but it is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a screenshot of a fake chyron and does not provide any other evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Maxine Waters would need to impeach Donald Trump if she either defeated him or succeeded him after he left office. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or reasoning.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the chyron in the original interview with Anderson Cooper was about Bill O'Reilly's departure from Fox News, not about Maxine Waters running for president in 2020.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the claim could be that it is a deliberate misinformation or propaganda spread by Trump's allies to discredit Maxine Waters."}
