{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating because it states that \"all living former Presidents of the United States\" have urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump, which is not entirely accurate as some former Presidents have not made such statements.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that former Republican Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have not endorsed Donald Trump, which could be seen as a significant factor in the context of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific statements or endorsements from all living former Presidents to back up the assertion that they have urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the former Presidents who have endorsed Hillary Clinton and criticized Donald Trump may have done so based on their party affiliations and personal opinions, rather than a unified stance against Trump by all living former Presidents."}
