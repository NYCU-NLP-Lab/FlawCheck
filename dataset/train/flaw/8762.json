{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which China pays for the tariffs, suggesting that they are \"mostly\" or \"largely\" paid by China when experts argue that it is the buyers and sellers who bear the costs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that China pays for the tariffs, as experts argue that it is the purchasers who pay the tariff when they buy popular products.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tariffs make American companies more competitive and benefit the economy, but economists argue that real-world examples of tariffs working as intended are rare and that consumers of the tariff-levying country are the primary victims, paying higher prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that importers, usually U.S. companies, are the ones who pay the tariffs to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not Chinese exporters."}
