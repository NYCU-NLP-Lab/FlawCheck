{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of mass shootings in the United States by stating that there have been more than 300, without providing enough context or comparison to other countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on data from the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced website that may not have comprehensive or accurate information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of mass shootings is the sole indicator of a problem and does not consider other factors such as population size, geographical context, or definitions of mass shootings used in different countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of other countries experiencing mass shootings but not reporting or documenting them in the same way.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Congressional Research Service developed a different definition for \"public mass shootings\" than the one used by the Mass Shooting Tracker.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering mass shootings in war zones or those motivated by gang rivalries, which could affect the comparison to other countries.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of mass shootings in other countries by not providing a comprehensive comparison or considering the specific circumstances in each country."}
