{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim of a \"7D hologram\" is understated because it explains that the video actually shows a demonstration of the potential capabilities of Magic Leap's technology, which involves layering virtual objects over real ones.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the video was created by a company called Magic Leap to demonstrate their technology, but it does not provide any further evidence or sources to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the children in the video did not actually witness a hologram whale splashing through their gym floor because they are not wearing any special headgear. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the possibility of the technology being integrated into the environment without the need for individual headgear.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the claim by stating that the video is a demonstration of Magic Leap's technology and not an actual \"7D hologram\" of a whale."}
