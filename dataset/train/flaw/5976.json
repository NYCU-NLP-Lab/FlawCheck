{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by implying that the video depicts the state of social distancing in the US during the coronavirus epidemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video that is at least four months old and from a different country (Brazil).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is from the US and shows the current state of social distancing during the coronavirus epidemic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video is actually from Brazil and shows a group of people eagerly waiting for a supermarket to open for a Black Friday sale, which is a different context than the claim suggests."}
