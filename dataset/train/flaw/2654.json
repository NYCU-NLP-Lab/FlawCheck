{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no clear evidence or credible sources provided to prove that Muslims took out a funeral procession celebrating Amit Shah contracting coronavirus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was shot in December 2019 in Kolkata, which is before Amit Shah informed about his COVID-19 positive status. Therefore, it cannot represent an event that took place after his announcement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that Muslims were celebrating Amit Shah contracting coronavirus, without providing substantial evidence or context to support this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of the mock funeral procession is related to Amit Shah contracting coronavirus, without providing clear evidence or context to establish this connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the video, such as it being a staged event or a protest unrelated to Amit Shah's COVID-19 status. However, without further evidence or context, it is difficult to determine the true purpose or meaning behind the video."}
