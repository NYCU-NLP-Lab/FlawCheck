{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years, which implies that no one has received a raise during that time period. However, the evidence suggests that income levels have increased, although the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent has remained relatively stagnant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of raises is solely due to the \"taking away the rights of working people and organized labor.\" This assumption overlooks other potential factors that could contribute to stagnant wages, such as technological advancements, globalization, and changes in the labor market.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is made by Tom Steyer, a businessman and Democratic presidential candidate, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. Without sufficient supporting evidence, the claim lacks credibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of raises, such as changes in the distribution of wealth, income inequality, or shifts in economic policies. By solely attributing the lack of raises to the \"taking away the rights of working people and organized labor,\" the claim fails to acknowledge other potential factors at play.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of PolitiFact, which analyzed a similar claim made by another Democratic presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg. PolitiFact found that while income levels for most people have increased since 1973, the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent has remained relatively consistent. Therefore, the claim contradicts the fact that income levels have actually risen beyond inflation during the period in question.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect."}
