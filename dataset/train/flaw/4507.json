{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerating Biden's record on deportations and indefinite detention for immigrants, as it fails to provide enough context and downplays the historical context and bipartisan support for such measures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully acknowledging the historical context and the fact that Biden's stance on border enforcement was in line with other Democrats at the time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that Biden \"voted to expand deportations and indefinite detention for immigrants multiple times.\" It only refers to specific votes in 1996 without providing a comprehensive analysis of his overall record.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden's support for border enforcement automatically translates to a harsh stance on immigration, without considering the complexities and nuances of the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that Biden's votes were influenced by the political climate and public opinion at the time, as well as the legacy of those laws that Democrats have been grappling with since then."}
