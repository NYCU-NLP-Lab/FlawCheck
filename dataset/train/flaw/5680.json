{"Exaggerate": "The claim that artisanal and small-scale miners are responsible for 90% of Nigeria's mineral production may be an exaggeration. The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence or support to confirm this statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the claim that artisanal and small-scale miners are responsible for 90% of Nigeria's mineral production.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that artisanal and small-scale miners are the primary contributors to Nigeria's mineral production without providing enough evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore alternative explanations for Nigeria's mineral production or consider other factors that may contribute to it.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state any instances where the claim falters, but the lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate or reliable."}
