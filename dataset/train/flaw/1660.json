{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single statistic cited by Rep. Lyle Larson without providing additional evidence or studies to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in opioid dosage for medical cannabis users is solely attributable to the use of cannabis, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reduction in opioid dosage, such as the placebo effect, concurrent changes in pain management strategies, or the individual characteristics of the patients involved.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential benefits of medical cannabis in reducing opioid dosage, as it only mentions a \"up to 75%\" reduction without acknowledging the possibility of even greater reductions.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of medical cannabis on opioid dosage by presenting the statistic without providing context or acknowledging any limitations or uncertainties in the research.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of presenting a comprehensive and balanced view of the topic, as it relies solely on Rep. Lyle Larson's statement and does not consider any opposing viewpoints or conflicting research."}
