{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that a 5,000-year-old temple was discovered during road construction work in Ayodhya. However, there is no concrete evidence provided to support this claim, making it potentially exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single image and a social media post, without any additional evidence or sources to support the age and discovery of the temple. This lack of supporting information weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image depicts a 5,000-year-old temple that was covered during road widening in Ayodhya. However, there is no factual basis or verification provided to substantiate this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the image resembles a construction site in Varanasi for the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. This alternative explanation suggests that the image may not be related to Ayodhya or a 5,000-year-old temple, raising doubts about the claim's accuracy.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim was previously viral in June, indicating that it may have been debunked or proven false. This contradiction to the claim's previous circulation suggests that it may not be based on factual information.", "Falters at times": "The claim mentions that locals had built houses upon the temple, covering it for a long time. However, there is no evidence or historical records provided to support this assertion, making it potentially unreliable or faltering in its accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim, as it primarily focuses on exaggeration and lack of support."}
