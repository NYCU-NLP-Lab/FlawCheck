{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the health care law by stating that there are \"$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the law aims to slow future growth in Medicare spending and does not actually cut from the Medicare program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details to substantiate the assertion of $500 billion in Medicare cuts. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides information from the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that support the reduction in future spending growth on Medicare, but do not confirm the exact amount of $500 billion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care law will result in detrimental effects such as job-killing mandates and regulations. However, it does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this assumption. The expert's verdict does not directly address this assumption but focuses on debunking the claim about Medicare cuts."}
