{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Obama's actions on air quality by stating that he left 40% of the U.S. with air quality that doesn't meet EPA standards, without providing context or considering improvements made during his presidency.", "Understate": "The claim understates the improvement in air quality under Obama by not acknowledging that there had been a \"major improvement\" in air quality, as stated in a report cited by Pruitt's office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that Obama left 40% of the U.S. with air quality that doesn't meet EPA standards. The evidence provided by Pruitt's office is contradicted by other data and reports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that air quality issues are solely the responsibility of the President, without considering other factors such as regional differences, local policies, and the role of other stakeholders.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the air quality issues, such as the impact of industrial activities, population density, and geographical factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama administration updated the standard for four out of the six air pollutants regulated by the EPA, indicating efforts to improve air quality.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by selectively presenting data and not providing a comprehensive analysis of air quality trends during Obama's presidency."}
