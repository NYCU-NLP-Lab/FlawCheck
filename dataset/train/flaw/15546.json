{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence of a pattern of Red Bull, Bang, or other energy drinks producing false positives for the drugs listed in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Red Bull and Bang energy drinks test positive for various illicit or prescription drugs in substance or urine tests, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the false positive results mentioned in the claim could be due to a flaw in substance-testing field kits rather than the actual presence of illicit or prescription drugs in the energy drinks."}
