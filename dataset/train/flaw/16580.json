The expert mentions logistical errors and digital imperfections in the image that cast doubt on its authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the photograph was a digital manipulation and mentions two individuals, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Penteado and Peter, who claimed to have a connection to the image. This indicates the existence of alternative explanations for the origin and authenticity of the photograph.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is genuine and accurately captures the moment before the attack, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph was quickly debunked as a digital manipulation. The expert states that the image was proven to be suspect beyond credibility due to logistical errors and digital imperfections.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact and significance of the photograph by suggesting that it sparked sensations of horror in everyone who viewed it and that it left the sheer horror of the moment raw and bared to the wind. This may not be the case for all viewers."}
