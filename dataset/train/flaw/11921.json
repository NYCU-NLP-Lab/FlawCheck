{"Understate": "The expert's verdict understates the claim by stating that \"no amount of drilling will turn up the iPhone 7's 'hidden' headphone jack.\" This implies that the claim is not true, when in fact, it is true that drilling into the shell will reveal the missing headphone jack.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the claim is false and that the image suggesting a hidden headphone jack was created as a joke mocking Apple's decision. This assumption may not be entirely accurate as the claim itself is true, and the image could have been created to highlight the absence of the headphone jack.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence or support to counter the claim. While they mention Apple's announcement about the removal of the headphone jack and the image circulated online, they do not provide any further evidence or sources to support their statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not consider alternative explanations for the image suggesting a hidden headphone jack. They only mention the possibility of it being a joke mocking Apple's decision, but there could be other reasons or interpretations for the image."}
