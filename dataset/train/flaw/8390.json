{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Donald Trump \"bans disabled veterans from his high rise.\" This is not entirely accurate as Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from selling their wares in front of his high rise, not ban them from the building altogether.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that banning disabled veterans from selling their wares in front of Trump's high rise is mistreatment. This is a subjective interpretation and may not be universally agreed upon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Trump mistreats disabled veterans. The provided information only shows Trump's stance on banning disabled veterans from peddling in front of his high rise, but it does not provide any concrete evidence of mistreatment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Trump's stance on banning disabled veterans from peddling in front of his high rise. It fails to explore whether there may be legitimate reasons behind Trump's concerns about turning Fifth Avenue into an outdoor flea market.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Trump's actions by focusing solely on the ban on peddling in front of his high rise. It does not address any potential consequences or implications for disabled veterans who relied on peddling as a means of earning a living.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump did not ban disabled veterans from his high rise but rather wanted to ban them from peddling in front of it. The claim's wording misrepresents the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting conflicting information. It initially states that Trump \"bans disabled veterans from his high rise,\" but later acknowledges that the wording of the claim was changed by the PAC supporting Marco Rubio. This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
