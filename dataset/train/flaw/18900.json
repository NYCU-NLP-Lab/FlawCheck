{"Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of funding provided by the U.S. National Institutes for Health (NIH) for tuberculosis research. The expert's verdict mentions that the NIH is the single-largest source of TB research money and represents more than 30 percent of the global investment in TB research and development. However, the claim only states that \"most funding\" is provided by the NIH, which may underestimate the actual contribution.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that the U.S. NIH is the main provider of funding for tuberculosis research. The expert's verdict mentions a report from the Treatment Action Group that found the NIH spent over $200 million on TB research in 2014, but the claim does not reference this information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of funding provided by the U.S. NIH is proportional to the impact of tuberculosis globally. However, the expert's verdict mentions that tuberculosis is the second deadliest infectious disease worldwide, with a significant number of deaths occurring outside the United States. This raises the question of whether the funding allocation is based on need or other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative sources of funding for tuberculosis research. The expert's verdict mentions that Novartis, a pharmaceutical company, had a research base in Singapore for tuberculosis, indicating that there may be other entities contributing to research efforts."}
