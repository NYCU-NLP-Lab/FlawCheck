{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the president is advocating a drone strike program in America lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the president is advocating a drone strike program in America based on a letter from the attorney general that did not explicitly rule out such strikes. However, this assumption may be problematic as the administration has clarified its stance and stated that they do not intend to carry out drone strikes on American soil.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the senator's concern about drone strikes on U.S. citizens on American soil, such as a desire to ensure the protection of civil liberties and due process rights."}
