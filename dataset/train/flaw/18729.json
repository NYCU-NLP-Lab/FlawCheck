{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people killed by the police in 2018. This bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, but it is possible that the claim is inflating the number for dramatic effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the numbers of people killed by the police in 2018 and those who died in police custody. This lack of supporting evidence makes the claim susceptible to this bias.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people killed by the police is directly comparable to the number of people who died in police custody. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any information or evidence to support this assumption, suggesting that it may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the reported numbers of people killed by the police and those who died in police custody. The expert's verdict mentions other statistics and cases of police misconduct, which could potentially provide alternative explanations for the numbers mentioned in the claim."}
