{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Dodd-Frank on small and mid-size banks, stating that \"over 40 percent\" have been wiped out, which is higher than the actual decline in numbers since the law was passed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the decline in small and mid-size banks since 2010, as the actual estimates range from 12 percent to 16 percent, which is less than what the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove the direct causation between Dodd-Frank and the decline of small and mid-size banks. Other factors and laws are also at play.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Dodd-Frank is solely responsible for the decline of small and mid-size banks, overlooking other factors such as consolidation and previous laws that contributed to the trend.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by pointing to the impact of laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s that allowed for consolidation and growth of big banks, while smaller banks folded into larger ones."}
