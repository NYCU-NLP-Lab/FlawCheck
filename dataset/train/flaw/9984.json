However, the expert's verdict suggests that some of these policyholders may have obtained new plans with more comprehensive benefits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential loss of health plans, such as policyholders voluntarily switching to new plans with better coverage.
