{"Contradict fact": "The claim suggests that Mike Coffman said two different things about deportations in different language settings. The expert's verdict confirms this claim to be true, indicating that Coffman did indeed make contradictory statements.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides evidence of Coffman's contradictory statements by mentioning specific instances where he made different remarks in Spanish and English. However, it does not provide further evidence or sources to support this claim, indicating a potential lack of sufficient support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Coffman's contradictory statements indicate a change in his immigration stance depending on the audience. While the expert's verdict mentions Coffman's moderation on immigration positions and his efforts to reach out to different communities, it does not explicitly confirm or refute this assumption, leaving it open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for Coffman's contradictory statements, and the expert's verdict does not offer any either. Therefore, it is unclear if there are alternative explanations for Coffman's statements."}
