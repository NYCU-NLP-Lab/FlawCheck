{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in revenue sharing between Connecticut and Rhode Island. It states that Connecticut's take on table games is zero, implying that Rhode Island's 18 percent share is significantly better. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Connecticut does not receive any share of table game revenue, but does receive 25 percent of slot machine revenue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the comparison between Connecticut and Rhode Island's revenue sharing. It only provides a statement from the CEO of Newport Grand without further evidence or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rhode Island's 18 percent share of revenue from new table games is a good deal compared to Connecticut's revenue sharing. However, the claim does not provide any context or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in revenue sharing between Connecticut and Rhode Island. It simply presents the difference in percentages without exploring the underlying reasons or factors that may contribute to this difference."}
