{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of money Scott Walker has given back, as the expert's investigation found that he returned a combination of $60,000 and $10,000 per year, not the full amount of his salary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that Scott Walker has given back over $370,000 of his salary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving back a portion of his salary is a positive action without considering any potential negative implications or alternative explanations for why he may have done so.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Scott Walker may have given back a portion of his salary, such as political motivations or to gain public favor after a scandal over lavish county pensions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not accurately represent the full history of Scott Walker's salary givebacks, including the reduction from $60,000 to $10,000 and the fact that he has also written checks to the county in addition to returning a portion of his salary."}
