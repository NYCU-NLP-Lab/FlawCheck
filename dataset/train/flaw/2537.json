McDonnell's proposed budget includes a $500 million increase in funding for public education, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual increase in funding for public education proposed by Gov. McDonnell, as it focuses on the perceived cuts rather than the overall budget increase.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not mention any inconsistencies or inconsistencies in the claim itself."}
