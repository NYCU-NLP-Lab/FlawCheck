{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of workers' incomes that are spent on healthcare. The expert's verdict provides evidence that workers have been making steady gains in weekly paychecks, suggesting that the claim's assertion of workers paying on average 20% of their incomes for healthcare may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that workers are paying on average 20% of their incomes for healthcare. The expert's verdict provides data on the increase in workers' earnings but does not directly address the claim's percentage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all workers are paying 20% of their incomes for healthcare, which may not be true for every worker. The expert's verdict mentions that rank-and-file workers have been making gains in earnings, suggesting that the claim's assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides information on the increase in CEO compensation compared to worker pay, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the claim's statement about only the wealthy doing well in the economy."}
