{"Exaggerate": "It is possible that some of the statements in the claim could be exaggerated to make a stronger impression or emphasize certain achievements. For example, the statement \"Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than 4 million houses since 1994\" could be an exaggeration if the actual number of houses provided is lower.", "Understate": "Conversely, some statements may downplay or understate certain issues or challenges. Without knowing the specific claim, it is difficult to identify such instances.", "Lack enough support": "Some statements may lack sufficient evidence or data to support their claims. This could be the case if the provided information is vague or lacks specific details.", "Problematic assumption": "The statements may make assumptions that are not adequately supported or may be based on biased perspectives. For example, the statement \"At the level of gender, at senior management level males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4%\" may assume that gender representation should be equal without considering other factors or reasons for the disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The statements may fail to consider alternative explanations or factors that could influence the presented information. Without the specific claim, it is challenging to identify such instances."}
