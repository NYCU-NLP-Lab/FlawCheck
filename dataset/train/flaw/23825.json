{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times Rep. Renee Ellmers voted for the government shutdown, as there is a discrepancy between Aiken's claim of 21 votes and Ellmers' staff's list of 24 votes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Rep. Renee Ellmers voted for the government shutdown 21 times, as there is a disagreement between Aiken's and Ellmers' staff's lists of votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. Renee Ellmers voted for the government shutdown based on her votes on certain budget proposals and rule changes, but it does not provide direct evidence of her intention to shut down the government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rep. Renee Ellmers' votes, such as voting in favor of GOP budget proposals knowing that they would be vetoed by President Obama, which could increase the likelihood of a government shutdown."}
