The evidence provided from the Tax Foundation is debatable and there are other studies that show different results.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Chris Christie \"inherited\" the highest taxes and worst unemployment, without considering any external factors or previous administrations' actions that may have contributed to these conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high taxes and unemployment in New Jersey, such as economic factors or policies implemented by previous administrations."}
