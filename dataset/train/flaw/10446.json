{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one example of wind turbines functioning properly in extremely cold locations (Antarctica), but does not provide additional evidence or examples.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because wind turbines can function properly in Antarctica, they can also function properly in other extremely cold locations. This assumption may not be valid as the conditions in Antarctica may be unique and different from other cold regions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the functioning of wind turbines in Antarctica, such as the specific design and installation methods used in the Princess Elisabeth Station. These alternative explanations suggest that wind turbines may not function properly in all extremely cold locations without similar conditions or adaptations."}
