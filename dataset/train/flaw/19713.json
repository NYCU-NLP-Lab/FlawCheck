{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the idea that there is a meaningful link between terrorist attacks and the 22nd day of the month.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a direct and significant connection between terrorist attacks and the specific date of the 22nd day of the month without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the occurrence of terrorist attacks on the 22nd day of the month may be coincidental or related to commemorative events rather than a meaningful pattern.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to establish a strong and conclusive link between terrorist attacks and the 22nd day of the month, as the expert's verdict highlights the need for caution in interpreting patterns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 22nd day of the month is not statistically more prone to terrorist attacks than any other day.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the 22nd day of the month by suggesting a strong link between terrorist attacks and this specific date, which the expert's verdict challenges.", "Understate": "There is no clear instance of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
