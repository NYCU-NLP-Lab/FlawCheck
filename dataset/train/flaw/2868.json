{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the chimpanzee's ability to rapidly memorize the location of numbers on a touch screen. The expert's verdict highlights that the chimpanzee's performance outperformed both their own mothers and human adults, suggesting a remarkable cognitive ability that is not easily achieved by humans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it only mentions the existence of a video showing the chimpanzee's ability. The expert's verdict provides additional information about the research conducted by Professor Matsuzawa and his colleagues, including peer-reviewed studies and experimental setups, which provide more substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that no human is capable of performing the task of rapidly memorizing the location of numbers on a touch screen. The expert's verdict mentions that the task is not easy for humans, but it does not explicitly state that it is impossible for humans to perform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the chimpanzee's ability, such as potential training or conditioning. The expert's verdict mentions that the young chimpanzees were trained to criterion on the task, suggesting that their performance may be a result of training rather than purely innate ability."}
