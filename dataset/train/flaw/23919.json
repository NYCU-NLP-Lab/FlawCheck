{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which health insurance companies deny treatments prescribed by doctors. The expert's verdict states that the statistic provided by the California Nurses Association may be misleading and that a sizable chunk of the denials counted by the nurses' group are for reasons that do not affect a consumer's care.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it only references a study released by the California Nurses Association, which the expert's verdict suggests may be misleading.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the denials mentioned in the study are solely due to insurance companies being insensitive and too quick to deny claims. The expert's verdict points out that many denials are for other bureaucratic reasons that do not affect a consumer's care.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the denials mentioned in the claim, stating that a sizable chunk of the denials are for reasons unrelated to insurance companies denying necessary treatments.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the reasons behind the denials mentioned in the study, as the expert's verdict suggests that the denials are not necessarily what most consumers would think of as denials.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of treatments denied by health insurance companies, as the expert's verdict mentions that the study reported that six of the largest insurers operating in California rejected 22 percent of all claims."}
