{"Understate": "The claim understates the prevalence of caesarean section deliveries in Nigeria by stating a rate of 2.1%, while the expert's verdict mentions rates ranging from 2% to 3%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the caesarean section threshold recommended by the WHO is far below the 10% mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increasing access to caesarean deliveries will automatically lower rates of death and disease related to pregnancy, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions regional differences in caesarean rates, indicating that factors such as urban versus rural areas and different regions within Nigeria can influence the prevalence of caesarean section deliveries, suggesting alternative explanations for the lower rates observed."}
