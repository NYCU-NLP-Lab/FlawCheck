{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"The only years that anybody's ever seen\" of Trump's tax returns \"showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\" This is not entirely true as there are records showing that Trump did pay federal income taxes in three of the five years covered in the returns.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Trump did pay federal income taxes in three of the five years covered in the tax returns. It fails to acknowledge this information and presents a misleading impression.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on unverified statements made by Hillary Clinton during a debate. The actual tax returns have not been released, and the evidence provided by New Jersey gambling regulators contradicts the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for Trump's tax payments, such as the fact that he reported losses in the final two years covered in the tax returns. This suggests that his lack of federal income tax payments was due to business losses rather than intentional tax avoidance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump did pay federal income taxes in three of the five years covered in the tax returns, as confirmed by New Jersey gambling regulators. It presents a false narrative that Trump didn't pay any federal taxes based on limited information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Trump's refusal to release his tax returns is solely because he doesn't want the American people to know about his lack of federal tax payments. This assumption may not be the only reason for his reluctance and is presented without sufficient evidence."}
