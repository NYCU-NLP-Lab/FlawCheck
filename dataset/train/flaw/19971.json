{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its validity. The expert's analysis and investigation reveal that there is no mention of a 50,000 peso bonus payment or instructions on how to sign up for it in the provided video or official statements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Philippines' Social Security System has officially declared the claim as \"fake news\" and stated that there is no truth to the bonus payment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Duterte approved a new bonus for workers without providing any credible sources or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of the supposed bonus by stating it as 50,000 pesos, which is equivalent to about $960. This amount seems unrealistic and inflated without any substantiating evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
