{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Rahul Gandhi's apology to the Supreme Court by stating that he \"apologised with folded hands,\" which may not have been explicitly mentioned in the sources provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to fully verify the statement that Rahul Gandhi apologized to the Supreme Court for allegations over the Rafale deal. The sources provided only mention news reports and social media posts without providing a direct statement or confirmation from Rahul Gandhi or the Supreme Court.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rahul Gandhi's alleged apology implies that he had previously lied about the Rafale deal, which may be a problematic assumption without further clarification or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Rahul Gandhi's alleged apology, such as expressing regret for his choice of words or clarifying a misunderstanding, which are not explored in the claim."}
