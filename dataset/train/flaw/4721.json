{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences of the new abortion law by suggesting that babies born alive would be left to die without any medical intervention. The expert's analysis suggests that the law removes criminal penalties and raises questions about what would happen to babies born alive, but does not provide concrete evidence that they would be intentionally allowed to die.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that babies born alive under the new abortion law would be left to die. The expert's analysis points out that the law repeals certain sections of the Public Health Law, but does not provide specific details or examples of instances where babies have been intentionally allowed to expire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that under the new abortion law, babies born alive would be intentionally allowed to die. However, the expert's analysis suggests that this assumption is not explicitly stated in the law and raises questions about the potential consequences for babies born alive.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there could be alternative explanations or interpretations of the new abortion law. For example, the law allows licensed medical professionals other than doctors to perform abortions, which raises the possibility that a qualified person may not be present if a baby is born alive. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that babies would be intentionally left to expire."}
