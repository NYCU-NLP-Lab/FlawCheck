{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to prove the existence of the quatrain or its connection to Nostradamus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quatrain accurately predicts future events, which is a problematic assumption as Nostradamus' predictions are often vague and can be interpreted in multiple ways.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the meaning of the quatrain, as different interpretations suggest that it refers to either Donald Trump or Joe Biden as the \"feeble man\" and \"jezebel\" rulers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the quatrain mentioned in the meme does not appear in Nostradamus' works, as confirmed by a search through The Compleat Works of Nostradamus.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Nostradamus' actual predictions by focusing on a meme that does not have a basis in his writings.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
