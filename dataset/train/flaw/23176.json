{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that Hillary Clinton's plan would allow 620,000 refugees to resettle in the U.S. during a first term as president without providing sufficient evidence or support for this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the claim that 620,000 refugees would be allowed to resettle in the U.S. under Hillary Clinton's plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton has a specific plan that would allow 620,000 refugees to resettle in the U.S., which may be a problematic assumption if there is no concrete evidence or details provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the claim, such as differing opinions on the number of refugees that would be allowed to resettle under a specific plan."}
