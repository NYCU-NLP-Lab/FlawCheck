{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists is leading by example and signifies a departure from the influence of lobbyists in politics. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there are caveats and loopholes in Obama's policy that weaken this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to demonstrate that Obama is truly refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists. The expert's verdict presents examples of Obama accepting money from individuals and firms connected to lobbying.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for Obama's claim, stating that while he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, he still accepts funds from individuals in the influence industry. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Obama is leading by example and refusing contributions from lobbyists.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the extent to which Obama accepts money from individuals connected to lobbying. The expert's verdict highlights that Obama accepted $55,019 from employees at lobbying firms and more from companies with lobbying divisions, indicating a potentially larger influence of lobbyists on his campaign than the claim suggests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama does accept money from individuals and firms connected to lobbying. The expert's verdict provides evidence of such contributions, which contradicts the claim's assertion of refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Obama's commitment to refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists. The expert's verdict points out the loopholes and caveats in Obama's policy, indicating that his claim to be funding his campaign differently from competitors may be exaggerated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully acknowledging the exceptions and inconsistencies in Obama's anti-lobbyist policy. The expert's verdict highlights instances where Obama qualifies his statements and accepts money from well-connected state lobbyists, indicating a lack of consistency in his approach."}
