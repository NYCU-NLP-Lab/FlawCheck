{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Rodrigo Duterte's presidency on the condition of the Pasig River by implying that it became significantly cleaner under his term.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos used in the claim were taken in 2011, several years before Duterte became president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Duterte's term had a direct impact on the condition of the river.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos accurately represent the state of the Pasig River before and after Duterte's presidency, without considering other factors that may have influenced the river's condition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the difference in the photos, such as the possibility of different locations or changes in environmental policies over time."}
