{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the protests by stating that \"the end of the pandemic\" has arrived, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the protests were against Germany's coronavirus restrictions. The photos have been misattributed to the COVID-19 protests when they were actually from Black Lives Matter protests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos are from protests against COVID-19 restrictions without verifying the source or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photos are actually from Black Lives Matter protests, which contradicts the claim made in the post."}
