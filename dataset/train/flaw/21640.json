{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific information about the location where the law is implemented and the specific details of the fines and license suspensions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that motorists will be fined $999 and have their licenses suspended for three years, while the expert's verdict explains that the fines and license suspensions vary depending on factors such as the type of license, driving experience, and previous violations.", "Understate": "The claim does not provide the full extent of the penalties and fines that can be imposed for distracted driving in different jurisdictions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all jurisdictions have the same punitive measures for distracted driving violations, which is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative examples of fines and penalties for distracted driving in other jurisdictions, such as Oregon and Illinois, which differ from the claim's statement."}
