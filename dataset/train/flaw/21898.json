{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump would be mobilizing U.S. military troops on American soil for the first time since 1807, when in fact the Insurrection Act has been invoked numerous times since then.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or examples to back up the assertion that President Trump would be mobilizing U.S. military troops on American soil for the first time since 1807.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Insurrection Act has been invoked multiple times since 1807, including in 1992 and during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's potential deployment of the U.S. military domestically would be the first since 1807, without considering the historical context and previous invocations of the Insurrection Act.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by incorrectly stating that a president hasn't deployed U.S. military troops on U.S. soil since 1807, ignoring instances where the Insurrection Act was invoked.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the Insurrection Act has been used in the past to protect civil rights and maintain order during times of unrest."}
