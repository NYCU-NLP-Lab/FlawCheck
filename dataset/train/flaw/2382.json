{"Contradict fact": "There is no evidence presented in the claim to suggest that federal officials declared that grant funds \"could be used only for Milwaukee's streetcar project.\" The claim contradicts this fact by stating that federal officials made this declaration.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility of redirecting the grant funds to other modes of public transportation or to public schools. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that it is not possible to redirect the funds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that federal officials declared the grant funds could only be used for the streetcar project.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the grant funds cannot be redirected to other modes of public transportation or public schools based on the statement made by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore. However, this assumption may be problematic as it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations or options for redirecting the grant funds. It assumes that it is not possible without providing any evidence or discussion of potential alternatives."}
