{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which electric car manufacturers rely on child labor to extract cobalt for their car batteries. While child labor has been used in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), electric car manufacturers have started to use ethically sourced cobalt from areas outside of the DRC.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that electric car manufacturers exclusively rely on child labor to extract cobalt for their car batteries, which is not supported by the evidence provided. Cobalt is also used in the manufacturing of rechargeable batteries in cellphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that electric car manufacturers rely on child labor to extract cobalt for their car batteries. While there have been instances of child labor in cobalt mines, it does not necessarily mean that all electric car manufacturers engage in such practices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the fact that cobalt is used in various other industries, including industrial and military applications, and is not solely used for electric car batteries."}
