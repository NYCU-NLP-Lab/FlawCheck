{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the financial impact of the 2016 shooting and murder rate in Chicago by stating that it cost the city $9.6 billion dollars, without providing enough evidence or support for this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for the stated cost figures of $9.6 billion dollars. It does not provide specific studies or data to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire cost of the 2016 shooting and murder rate in Chicago is solely responsible for the financial difficulties faced by the city. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the city's financial challenges.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the entire City budget for 2018 is stated to be $8.6 billion dollars, while claiming that the shooting and murder rate alone cost $9.6 billion dollars. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and accurate information, as evidenced by the campaign's alteration of the wording after being questioned about it by PolitiFact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the financial challenges faced by the city of Chicago, such as economic factors, mismanagement of funds, or other budgetary issues. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
