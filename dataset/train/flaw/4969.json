{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the actions taken by Republicans in Wisconsin by stating that they \"bolted windows inside the Capitol shut.\" The expert's investigation reveals that the windows were actually being re-secured, not completely bolted shut.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Republicans in Wisconsin actually bolted windows shut. The expert's investigation only found pictures of bolts in wooden windows and a blog post claiming that windows were being welded shut, but no concrete evidence or confirmation of this action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the action of bolting windows shut was done as part of efforts to rein in protesters. However, the expert's investigation does not provide any evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation provides an alternative explanation for the action of securing the windows, stating that they were done about 10 years ago to prevent unauthorized access to the Capitol."}
