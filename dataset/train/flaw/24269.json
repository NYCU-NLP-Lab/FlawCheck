{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the school makes students dress as pro-democracy protesters, when in fact the photos were taken during a school activity unrelated to the protests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos depict students dressed as pro-democracy protesters, without providing enough evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the students were actually dressed as pro-democracy protesters, as the school stated that the photos were taken before the protests began.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos were taken during a school activity, not as a deliberate act by the school to make students dress as protesters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the school, stating that the photos were taken at an event unrelated to the pro-democracy protests. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion."}
