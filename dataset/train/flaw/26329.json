{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the spending cuts made by the governor. The expert's analysis shows that the total budget holes filled during the governor's term amounted to about $7.28 billion, not the claimed $5 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no single document that lists each action taken to balance the general fund. The expert had to piece together figures from various reports to construct a summary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the reductions were made in the general fund, without providing evidence or clarification on whether there were other areas where spending was reduced.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the budget reductions, such as increased expenses in providing Medicaid, which accounted for a portion of the budget holes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of the actions taken to cut spending. The expert had to piece together information from various sources to understand the full picture.", "Understate": "It is unclear whether the claim understates the extent of the spending cuts, as the expert's analysis shows that the total budget holes filled during the governor's term amounted to about $7.28 billion, which is higher than the claimed $5 billion. However, without more specific information on the nature of the spending cuts, it is difficult to determine if there was any understatement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any facts presented by the expert's analysis. However, it may contradict the extent of the spending cuts made by the governor, as discussed under the exaggeration bias."}
