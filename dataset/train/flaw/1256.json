{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the winning lottery numbers came from a Thai submarine. The only evidence provided is an image of a submarine with the numbers \"99999-7\" printed on its side, but there is no direct connection or proof that these are the winning lottery numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of the numbers on the submarine is evidence of a scam in the lottery draw. However, this assumption is not supported by any factual evidence or logical reasoning.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the winning numbers for the first prize in Thailand's National Lottery were announced as 999997, not 99999-7. This discrepancy undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the numbers on the submarine by suggesting a scam in the lottery draw. There is no substantial evidence or logical reasoning provided to support this exaggerated claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
