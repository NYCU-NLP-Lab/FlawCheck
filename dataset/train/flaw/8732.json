{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that WHO DG Tedros Ghebreyesus has tested positive for Covid-19, when there is no evidence or confirmation of this.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Tedros only mentioned being a contact of someone who tested positive for Covid-19 and did not confirm his own positive test.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or confirmation provided to support the assertion that Tedros tested positive for Covid-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tedros' self-quarantine is due to his own positive test, when he explicitly stated that it was in line with WHO protocols for being a contact of a positive case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Tedros may have tested negative for Covid-19 or may not have been tested at all."}
