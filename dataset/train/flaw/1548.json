{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which \"catch and release\" is solely a Democrat rule. The expert's verdict states that the policy has continued under Trump's administration and has been in place across both Democratic and Republican administrations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that \"catch and release\" is exclusively a Democrat rule. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the policy has been in place under multiple administrations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that \"catch and release\" is solely a Democrat rule without considering the actions and policies of other political parties. The expert's verdict highlights that Senate Republicans also attempted to stop the practice during Obama's administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the continuation of the \"catch and release\" policy. The expert's verdict mentions a backlog of cases and a shortage of immigration judges as factors contributing to the policy's continuation."}
