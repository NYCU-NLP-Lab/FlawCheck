{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state budget faces a \"shortfall\" estimated at nearly $1.8 billion, according to a Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the surplus by stating that the 2014 budget will begin with a $443 million surplus, while the actual surplus is expected to be lower due to lower than expected tax collections.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential deficit by not acknowledging the potential need for a budget repair bill by June 30, 2015 unless revenue comes in higher than currently expected and/or spending is reduced.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Wisconsin does not have a deficit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Republican reforms are solely responsible for the surplus without considering other factors that may have contributed to it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential deficit, such as changes in revenue or spending."}
