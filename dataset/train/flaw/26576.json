GOP, Robin Hayes, which misrepresents Comey's testimony and misinterprets the nature of the leaked memo.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Comey testified under oath that the memo in question did not contain any classified information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which suggests that Comey's release of the memo was within his rights as long as it did not contain classified information, according to attorney Michael Kohn."}
