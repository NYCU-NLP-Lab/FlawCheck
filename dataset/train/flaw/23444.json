{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the progress of building the wall by implying that construction is underway and that $1.6 billion is being used for it, when in reality, only projects to improve or replace existing fencing are being funded.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that construction of the wall has actually started.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of the wall has begun based on President Trump's statements, without considering the actual facts and funding limitations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no prototype for the border wall has been selected yet, as confirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual progress of the wall by stating that only projects to improve or replace existing fencing are being carried out, rather than the construction of a new border wall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the photos shared by Trump in his tweet were for the replacement of an existing border wall, rather than the construction of a new one."}
