{"Exaggerate": "The claim that food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama is an exaggeration. The actual increase is 36 percent, not 150 percent as stated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that food stamps have increased by two-and-a-half times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in food stamp usage is solely due to Obama's policies, without considering external factors such as the recession and pre-existing eligibility broadening policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the increase in food stamp usage, such as the recession and pre-existing policies from the previous administration."}
