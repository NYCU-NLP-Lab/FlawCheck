{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that women in Congress get more things done, as the provided studies present conflicting findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of women in Congress leads to more bipartisan effort and more bills passed, which is not supported by all the studies mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The studies mentioned suggest that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the greater hurdles faced by women politicians leading them to work harder once in office.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of the political scientists who studied the actions of members of Congress and found that women did not have more bipartisan tendencies or demonstrate a greater willingness to collaborate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of significant differences between men and women in Congress in terms of their effectiveness in getting bills passed and working in a consensual manner, as suggested by the study published by Quorum.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the conflicting findings of different studies and selectively presenting evidence that supports the assertion while ignoring evidence that contradicts it."}
