{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Jeb Bush's Medicaid program grew twice as fast as John Kasich's, without providing specific data or comparing the timeframes accurately.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Bush's Medicaid program grew twice as fast as Kasich's.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth rate of Medicaid programs directly reflects the fiscal responsibility of the governors, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The rapid growth of Florida's Medicaid program during Bush's first term can be attributed to increased spending on long-term care and efforts to address issues in the long-term care system, rather than solely being a result of poor fiscal management."}
