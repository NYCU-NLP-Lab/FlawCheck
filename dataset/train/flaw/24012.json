{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the omission of \"one nation under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance during the Democratic National Convention, as it was only omitted in some caucus meetings and not in the primetime televised spots.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that \"one nation under God\" was deliberately omitted from the Pledge of Allegiance during the Democratic National Convention.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the omission of \"one nation under God\" from some caucus meetings reflects the overall stance of the Democratic National Convention, which may not be an accurate assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the omission of \"one nation under God\" during some caucus meetings could be attributed to individual choices or preferences rather than a deliberate omission by the Democratic National Convention as a whole."}
