{"Understate": "The claim may understate Trump's position on equal pay by not acknowledging that he has said he supports the concept of women and men making equal pay.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively state that Trump doesn't believe in equal pay, as there are conflicting statements and actions from Trump and his campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's lack of specific policies on equal pay means he doesn't believe in it, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Trump's stance on equal pay, as his daughter Ivanka Trump has stated that women are paid equally at Trump Organization."}
