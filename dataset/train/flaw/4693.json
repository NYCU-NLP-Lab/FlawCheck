{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the country borrows a million dollars every minute is considered a little high, as the actual borrowing is around $40 billion less per year.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual amount of debt accumulated unevenly, in fits and starts, from day to day as specific bills come due.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the country borrows a million dollars every minute.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the rate of borrowing during the Great Recession, as it has significantly decreased since then.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that borrowing money from China to send it to Pakistan is a common occurrence, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations or factors to consider, such as the debt and deficits being meaningful as a percentage of the country's income rather than as a raw number."}
