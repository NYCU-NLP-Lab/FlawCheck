{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump shared an image of a \"Bikers for Trump\" member with Nazi tattoos, when in fact he did not share that specific image.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to show that President Trump actually shared the image in question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image shared by President Trump included a biker with a Nazi tattoo, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided that the image of the biker with the Nazi tattoo was taken at a different event and not related to President Trump's tweet about the \"Bikers for Trump\" visiting his golf club."}
