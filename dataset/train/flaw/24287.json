{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which the Cuban government provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives, as experts suggest that it is more of a remnant of the Cold War era rather than a current policy.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately reflecting the current situation, as the Obama administration removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2015.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to demonstrate the extent to which the Cuban government provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives, as specific numbers and recent data are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a few U.S. fugitives and terrorists in Cuba represents a consistent policy of providing safe harbor, which experts suggest is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the presence of fugitives and terrorists in Cuba is a result of political motivations or historical circumstances, rather than a deliberate policy of providing safe harbor."}
