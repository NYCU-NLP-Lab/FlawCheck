{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that President Trump exaggerates when describing the reduction in the top marginal rate for pass-through business income as a boost to small businesses and truckers. Trump claims that \"more than 30 million\" small businesses get \"a 40 percent cut\" in their tax rate, which the expert deems as an exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump has made the claim about 30 million small businesses and the 40 percent tax cut several times. This suggests that Trump may not consistently provide accurate information or may falter in his messaging.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that there are nowhere near 30 million pass-through business owners in the highest tax brackets. This implies that the claim lacks enough support or evidence to be considered accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that Trump's claim about the reduction in the top marginal rate benefiting small businesses and truckers is a problematic assumption. The expert argues that lowering the top rate would only benefit pass-through business owners in the highest tax brackets.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that businesses organized as sole proprietorships, limited liability companies, or S corporations don't pay corporate income tax. Instead, the business income is \"passed-through\" to the owners or partners, who pay individual income taxes on the earnings. This suggests that the claim's focus on small businesses may not accurately represent the impact of the tax rate reduction."}
