{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of manufacturing jobs lost in Wisconsin in 2017. The actual number was 3,726, not \"almost 4,000.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by stating the incorrect year for the manufacturing job loss. It should have focused on 2016 instead of 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet from a candidate's campaign without providing any additional evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loss of manufacturing jobs is solely attributed to Governor Scott Walker's policies, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the job loss.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the fact that Wisconsin actually gained manufacturing jobs in the most recent full year available (2016-2017), indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the fluctuations in job numbers."}
