{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that \"every penny\" of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025. The expert's verdict mentions that this statement is a shade different from the actual projections in the CBO report, which also considers tax revenues and borrowing to finance the budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CBO's projections will continue indefinitely without any changes in policies. The expert's verdict mentions that the CBO report presents two scenarios, one assuming the continuation of major policies in effect in June 2011 and another assuming the implementation of laws on the books at that time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or references to support the statement that \"every penny\" of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025. The expert's verdict mentions that the statement made by Rep. Frank Wolf is based on a CBO report from June 2011, but it does not provide further details or specific data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Frank Wolf is focusing on the bleakest scenario presented in the CBO report, but there is another, more optimistic outlook that assumes different policy changes. This suggests that there are alternative explanations and interpretations of the CBO's projections.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Frank Wolf's statement falters in the sense that it does not accurately represent the full scope of the CBO report and the potential funding options available to the government. The claim may be seen as faltering in presenting a simplified and exaggerated view of the situation."}
