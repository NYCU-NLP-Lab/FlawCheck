{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Carlos Curbelo's support for raising flood insurance rates, as it only mentions that he \"supported\" it without specifying the level of support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Carlos Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates, as there is no evidence of his participation in relevant votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Carlos Curbelo's comments during GOP primary debates indicate his support for raising flood insurance rates, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Carlos Curbelo's statements during the debates that do not necessarily indicate his support for raising flood insurance rates."}
