{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single website post and does not provide any additional evidence or sources to corroborate the information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new virus spreading in China in September 2020 is a completely separate and distinct virus from the previously reported SFTS virus. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that SFTS is the same virus that was first reported in China in 2009 and has been spreading in East Asia since then.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that SFTS is not a new virus but has been known and reported since 2009. The claim's assertion that a \"new virus\" is spreading in China in September 2020 is not accurate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the prevalence and spread of SFTS by presenting it as a new virus found in China in September 2020. The expert's verdict provides evidence that SFTS has been reported in China, South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam over the past decade, indicating a wider spread than suggested by the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the virus spreading in China in September 2020 is the same SFTS virus that has been previously reported, rather than a completely new virus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance and novelty of the virus spreading in China in September 2020 by presenting it as a new virus causing concern among netizens. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that SFTS is not a new virus and has been known and reported for over a decade.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as there is no specific evidence provided in the expert's verdict to support this bias."}
