{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the financial impact of childhood obesity in Georgia by stating that the health care price tag is $2.4 billion annually and rising. The expert's verdict highlights that the $2.4 billion estimate mentioned by the governor and others does not specifically specify children and that the average annual medical cost for children is actually $200.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the $2.4 billion estimate. The expert's verdict mentions that the report provided by the governor's office does not specify children and that the estimate comes from comparing annual medical spending for obese and non-obese people without providing a specific total for obese children in Georgia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care price tag for childhood obesity in Georgia is solely responsible for the $2.4 billion annually and rising. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the annual cost for children is less than adults because they face fewer health problems, and many expensive issues associated with obesity don't manifest until later in life.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the $2.4 billion estimate includes out-of-pocket costs and other expenses, but it does not provide alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the overall cost of childhood obesity in Georgia."}
