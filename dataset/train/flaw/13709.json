{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the numbers provided for lion populations in the past.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lion population has decreased significantly without providing concrete evidence or considering other factors that might affect population numbers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that accurate numbers for lion populations in the past are virtually nonexistent, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim might potentially understate the decline in lion populations by not considering alternative estimates that suggest even lower numbers in the past.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information about the lion population, as different sources and experts provide varying estimates and data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There might be alternative explanations for the decline in lion populations, such as changes in habitat, poaching, or human-wildlife conflicts, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim might potentially exaggerate the decline in lion populations by using numbers that are not supported by concrete evidence or reliable data."}
