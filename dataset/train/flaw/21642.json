{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of lives saved by the First Coast Guard District, as the actual average for the past three years is 383, not 350.", "Understate": "The claim understates the value of the Coast Guard's work by using the lower number of 350 instead of the actual average of 383 lives saved.", "Falters at times": "The Coast Guard's news releases falters at times by not consistently stating that 350 is an average, leading to confusion and misrepresentation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that 350 lives are saved each year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all cases where the Coast Guard assists or tows in vessels with mechanical trouble should be considered as lives saved, which may not be accurate according to the Coast Guard's own distinction between \"saved\" and \"assisted\" cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the discrepancy in the number of lives saved, such as different criteria for counting or reporting, which may affect the accuracy of the claim."}
