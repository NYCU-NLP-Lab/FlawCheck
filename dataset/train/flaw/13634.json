{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the tax increase proposed by Biden, stating it as a 14% tax hike on middle-class families, which is not supported by evidence.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential impact on middle-income Americans from Biden's plan, as independent think tanks have found a smaller hit on middle-income Americans from indirect effects of a corporate tax hike.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that Biden's plan would result in a 14% tax increase on middle-class families.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Biden's plan would give illegal immigrants amnesty and healthcare, which is not supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the alleged 14% tax hike on middle-income Americans, as it is unclear where this figure comes from in Biden's plan."}
