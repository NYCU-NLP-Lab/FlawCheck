{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that a group of whales came to the surface after hearing an orchestra playing music. In reality, the video is a commercial created by an advertising agency and the whales in the video are not real.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents a video without providing any evidence or context to support the claim that the whales were responding to the music.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows a genuine event, when in fact it is a commercial created for a telecommunications company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the behavior of the whales in the video, as they were not real whales but digital creations by a digital arts studio."}
