{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may understate the effectiveness of mouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium chloride in reducing COVID-19 in saliva. The expert mentions that the findings show promise, but also highlights the limitations and caveats of the study, indicating that the claim may not fully convey the potential impact of these mouthwashes.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that the study's findings have not yet been tested on humans and have not been peer-reviewed or replicated at a larger scale. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support due to the limited evidence available.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that some headlines made bold claims like \"Mouthwash Can Kill COVID-19 in 30 Seconds, Study Reveals,\" which may indicate a problematic assumption in the claim. The claim itself does not make such a bold statement, but the expert's verdict suggests that the claim may be associated with exaggerated or misleading headlines.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the mouthwash study was conducted in vitro, meaning it was not tested on humans but rather mimicked conditions found in the throat. This raises the possibility that there may be alternative explanations or factors that could influence the effectiveness of mouthwashes in reducing COVID-19 in saliva.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any contradictions with facts in the claim. However, it highlights the limitations and caveats of the study, indicating that the claim may not fully align with established scientific knowledge or consensus.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state that the claim exaggerates the effectiveness of mouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium chloride. However, it emphasizes the preliminary nature of the findings and the need for further testing and peer review, suggesting that the claim may be associated with exaggerated or premature conclusions.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not indicate any instances where the claim falters or makes inconsistent statements. The focus is more on the limitations and caveats of the study rather than specific inconsistencies in the claim itself."}
