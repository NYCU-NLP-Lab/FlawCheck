{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Patrick Gaspard and ACORN by referring to him as the \"right-hand man\" for Bertha Lewis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a throwaway line in a blog posting that has been proven wrong.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gaspard's previous employment with ACORN means he still has close ties to the organization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Gaspard's previous employment with ACORN does not necessarily mean he is still affiliated with the organization."}
