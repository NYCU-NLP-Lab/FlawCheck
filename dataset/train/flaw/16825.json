{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which tolls were raised, stating that they were raised by 50 percent when in reality it was a 53 percent hike on the Turnpike and a 50 percent increase on the Parkway.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that Jon Corzine raised the tolls by 50 percent. It is supported by the fact that the toll increases were approved under Corzine's administration, but there is no specific evidence provided to show that Corzine was solely responsible for the 50 percent increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising tolls is inherently negative and places blame on Corzine for the toll hikes, without considering the reasons behind the increases or the potential benefits they may have provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim attributes the toll hikes solely to Jon Corzine, there may be alternative explanations or factors that contributed to the decision to raise tolls, such as the need for funding for infrastructure projects or budgetary constraints."}
