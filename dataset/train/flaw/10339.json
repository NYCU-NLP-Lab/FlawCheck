{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the economic impact of one daily international flight by stating that it generates $150 million a year and approximately 2,300 jobs. The actual study shows that the value to the local economy is less than half, under $70 million per new route, and the jobs added would be around 1,200, not 2,300.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the numbers provided by the mayor do not match the findings of the study. The expert mentions that economic impact studies can vary widely, and the claim does not provide enough evidence to support the specific figures mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the economic impact of one daily international flight is solely positive, without considering any potential negative effects or alternative explanations. The expert mentions that economic impact studies can vary greatly, indicating that there may be alternative explanations or factors to consider.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual findings of the study presented by the airport consultant. The claim cherry-picks one figure and inflates the other, misrepresenting the economic impact of one daily international flight.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
