{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the radioactive seepage spreading across the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima nuclear plant, as the provided expert's verdict mentions that the chart accompanying the claim does not track or measure radioactive discharge from Fukushima.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that radioactive seepage is spreading across the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima nuclear plant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by implying that the image provided accurately represents the radioactive seepage from Fukushima, when in fact it is a chart showing the tsunami wave height after the Tohoku earthquake.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the chart accompanying it does not depict the flow or spread of radioactive seepage from Fukushima.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation, as the expert's verdict mentions that American officials have stated that the diluting effects of the Pacific Ocean would likely neutralize any deleterious effects from the radioactive seepage by the time it reached U.S. shores."}
