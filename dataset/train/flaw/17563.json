{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual cost of rebuilding Portland Public high schools by only mentioning the hard construction costs of $220 per square foot. The expert's verdict mentions that there are additional on-site improvement \"hard\" costs estimated at $8 per square foot, which are not included in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to validate the stated cost of $220 per square foot for rebuilding Portland Public high schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the district estimates this cost based on a project estimating method, but it does not provide further details or evidence to support this estimation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of rebuilding Portland Public high schools is solely based on hard construction costs. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there are additional on-site improvement costs that are not accounted for in the claim. This assumption may lead to an incomplete understanding of the total cost.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the cost of rebuilding Portland Public high schools. It presents a specific cost estimation without considering other factors or possibilities that may affect the overall cost.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the previous bond measure for school rebuilds in Portland was rejected by voters due to concerns about transparency and oversight. The claim does not acknowledge this context and presents the current bond measure as a response to the public's demand for greater transparency and fiscal diligence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the cost of rebuilding Portland Public high schools by not accounting for all the necessary expenses. The inclusion of only hard construction costs without mentioning on-site improvement costs may create an inflated perception of the total cost.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times since the provided information does not indicate any specific instances where the claim may be inconsistent or unreliable."}
