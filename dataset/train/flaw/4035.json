{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer attributed to marijuana lacks enough support. The expert's verdict mentions that there have been people who smoked marijuana and had lung cancer, but it is unclear if marijuana caused the cancer. The research supporting this claim also comes with significant caveats and experts say more research is needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of reported medical cases of lung cancer attributed to marijuana means that marijuana does not cause lung cancer. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the research on this topic has limitations and more research is needed to reach more definitive conclusions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the absence of reported medical cases of lung cancer attributed to marijuana. The expert's verdict mentions that while there is moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer, there are limitations to the studies reviewed and more research is needed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in presenting a clear and supported argument. The expert's verdict mentions that the research supporting the claim comes with significant caveats and limitations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks or adverse effects of heavy consumption of marijuana. The expert's verdict mentions a study that found no statistically significant association between smoking cannabis and lung cancer incidence, but noted that \"the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been people who smoked marijuana and had lung cancer. While it is unclear if marijuana caused the cancer, the claim's statement that there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer attributed to marijuana is contradicted by this information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the certainty of the statement by stating that there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer attributed to marijuana. The expert's verdict mentions that the research supporting this claim comes with significant caveats and more research is needed."}
