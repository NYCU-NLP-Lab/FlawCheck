{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the effectiveness of border patrols in taking out people who have trafficked drugs. While some drug arrests have been made at checkpoints, it is not clear if this happens \"every time\" or if it is the primary focus of these patrols.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that every border patrol has resulted in the apprehension of drug traffickers. The evidence provided only mentions drug arrests made at checkpoints, but it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all border patrols.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that drug arrests at checkpoints are part of the federal government's role. However, the U.S. Supreme Court and state Supreme Court have ruled that checkpoints must primarily be intended for immigration enforcement, not drug searches. This raises doubts about the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the fact that drug arrests at checkpoints are carried out by local law enforcement, not federal agents directly. This alternative explanation suggests that the federal government's role may not be as direct or significant in these drug arrests as implied in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the role of the federal government in drug arrests at checkpoints. While the claim attributes these arrests to the federal government's role, it is clarified that local law enforcement is responsible for carrying out these arrests.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations and restrictions placed on drug searches at immigration checkpoints by the U.S. Supreme Court and state Supreme Court. These courts have ruled that drug possession checkpoints are inappropriate and go beyond the intended purpose of immigration enforcement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that drug arrests at checkpoints are not primarily carried out by federal agents but by local law enforcement. This contradicts the claim's assertion that \"they've taken out people who have trafficked drugs\" as if it is solely the federal government's role."}
