{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Donald Trump \"kicked\" a crying baby out of a political rally, when in fact he only made a comment about the baby being removed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's comment about the baby being removed was an act of hostility or intolerance towards the baby, when there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Donald Trump kicked a crying baby out of a political rally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star, who witnessed the incident and stated that Trump never actually ordered the baby to be removed, but rather made a comment after the mother had already left the room with the baby.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading headlines and mischaracterizing the incident, as acknowledged by the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump did not physically kick the baby out of the rally, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual sequence of events by not fully acknowledging that the mother and the baby returned to their seats later in the rally, as mentioned by the expert's verdict."}
