{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Vermont is becoming racially diverse, as the increase in non-white populations is described as slight.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Vermont is indeed becoming increasingly diverse, as the increase in non-white populations is minimal and not statistically significant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that inviting SNL viewers to Vermont will showcase its increasingly diverse communities, without providing evidence or examples to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in non-white populations, such as migration patterns or changes in data collection methods."}
