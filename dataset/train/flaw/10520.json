{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that NASA did not confirm the Earth will experience 15 days of darkness in November 2017.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential changes that the Earth could endure by stating that it will experience total darkness for 15 days.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible source provided to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the interactions between Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun will cause a blackout on Earth, which is a problematic assumption as it is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations to the claim, such as the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus being a normal astronomical event that does not result in a blackout on Earth."}
