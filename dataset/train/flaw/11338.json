{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the idea that the CDC has abruptly stopped reporting flu deaths altogether.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the CDC has stopped reporting flu deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lower number of flu deaths in the current season is due to the CDC's decision to stop reporting, without considering other factors such as the impact of COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the possibility that the lower flu death numbers could be attributed to factors other than the CDC's reporting, such as increased vaccination rates or changes in public health measures."}
