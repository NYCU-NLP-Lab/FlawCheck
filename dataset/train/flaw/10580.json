{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Pope Francis decreed that Catholics cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, when in fact there is no evidence of any such decree from Pope Francis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that Pope Francis made such a decree.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that a letter from Pope Benedict XVI in 2004, which does not mention Hillary Clinton, is somehow applicable to the 2016 election and the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pope Francis did not issue any decree forbidding Catholics from voting for Hillary Clinton.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of a letter from Pope Benedict XVI, rather than any actual decree from Pope Francis."}
