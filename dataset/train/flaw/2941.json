{"Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that they asked Paul's campaign for the numbers used to arrive at the conclusion but did not receive a response. Therefore, there is a lack of supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if the income tax were eliminated, the revenue would be the same as it was 10 years ago. This assumption may not be valid as it does not take into account other factors that could affect revenue.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of eliminating the income tax by suggesting that the revenue would only be the same as it was 10 years ago. The expert mentions that the difference between the two numbers is about 12 percent, which is a significant shortfall.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that the claim \"falters at times\" because the difference between the two numbers widens to a roughly 30 percent shortfall when adjusted for inflation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that Paul advocates reducing the budget through various measures such as slashing the defense budget and abolishing federal functions. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, rather than solely relying on the elimination of the income tax."}
