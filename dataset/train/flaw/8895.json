{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the difference in spending between prisons and schools in South Carolina by presenting the numbers without providing context or considering other factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that South Carolina spends too much on prisons and not enough on schools. It only provides the per inmate and per student spending figures without further analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spending disparity between prisons and schools reflects distorted priorities without considering the complexities and factors involved in budget allocation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in spending, such as the higher costs associated with providing 24-hour care, security, and other services for inmates compared to students.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying it to a matter of spending disparities without considering other factors that impact education and criminal justice systems.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that South Carolina's spending on prisons and schools is not the largest disparity among states, suggesting that the claim may be misleading or overstating the issue."}
