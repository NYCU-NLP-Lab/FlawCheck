{"Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the Firearm Owners Protection Act signed by Reagan. The provision mentioned in the claim is not an outright ban on fully automatic rifles, but rather restrictions on private sale and ownership.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough support or evidence to fully substantiate the assertion that Reagan \"banned ownership of fully automatic rifles\" and \"supported the assault weapons ban.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the provisions mentioned in the expert's verdict constitute a ban on fully automatic rifles and support for the assault weapons ban, which is debatable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Reagan did not outright ban ownership of fully automatic rifles, but rather imposed restrictions on their private sale and ownership."}
