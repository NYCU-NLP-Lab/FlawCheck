{"Lack enough support": "The claim that 70% of people living in abject poverty are women lacks sufficient statistical evidence to support it, as confirmed by the World Bank, UN Women, and UN Development Programme.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the original statistic from 1995 is still accurate and applicable today, despite doubts raised by experts and organizations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts suggest that the real figure of women living in poverty is likely lower than 70%, indicating the existence of alternative explanations or factors influencing poverty rates."}
