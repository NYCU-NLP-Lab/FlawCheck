{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Ann Kirkpatrick votes with her party by stating that she votes with her party \"nearly 90 percent of the time.\" The actual numbers provided by CQ Roll Call show that her party support ranged from 84-88 percent in recent years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that Ann Kirkpatrick votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time. It only mentions that the ad's claim \"checks out based on the numbers we found,\" without further elaboration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation as it mentions that historically, most members of Congress vote along party lines, and the partisan divide has worsened in the last 60 years. This suggests that high party support is not unique to Ann Kirkpatrick but rather a common trend among members of Congress.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it acknowledges that Ann Kirkpatrick has voted against party lines on certain occasions, such as her support for the Ratepayer Protection Act and her vote against the American Clean Energy and Securities Act. This indicates that she does not always vote in alignment with her party.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by equating voting with the party to support for President Barack Obama. While it states that Kirkpatrick's support of Obama was 76-77 percent in certain years, it does not provide evidence to directly link her party voting record to her support for the president.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support Ann Kirkpatrick receives from her party by stating that she votes with her party \"nearly 90 percent of the time.\" The actual numbers provided show that her party support ranged from 84-88 percent, which is still a significant majority of the time."}
