{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no substantial evidence to prove that Angeli would testify against the president and help Senators who want to convict him.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Angeli was willing to testify against President Trump in his second impeachment trial, but the nature of his comments remained unknown at the time of writing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Angeli's attorney stated that his client's attitude towards the president had changed since the insurrection, but it does not provide a clear explanation for why Angeli would be willing to testify against Trump.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that Angeli was willing to testify against Trump in his second impeachment trial, but the expert's verdict mentions that no statement to the contrary has been made by Angeli's attorney.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the attorney representing Angeli stated that his client was previously \"horrendously smitten\" by Trump but currently felt betrayed by him. This suggests that Angeli's opinion of Trump may have changed over time, indicating a potential bias in the claim.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any potential biases of understating in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any potential biases of exaggeration in the claim."}
