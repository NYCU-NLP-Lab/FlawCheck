{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not from a recent protest at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) but from a 2016 protest in New Delhi against the RSS.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photo shows university students protesting against fee hike, while the actual protest in the photo was against the RSS following the suicide of a university student in Hyderabad.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up its assertion that the photo is from a recent protest at JNU.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the presence of an anti-RSS placard at the protest indicates that the students were protesting against the RSS, when in fact the protest was specifically about the suicide of a student.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the photo is from a previous protest and not related to the current fee hike protests at JNU."}
