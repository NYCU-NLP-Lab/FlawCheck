{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the achievement of balancing the budget with an $11 billion deficit, as the expert's verdict points out that the deficit calculation was dismissed as the \"old way of budgeting\" and the structural deficit still existed in subsequent years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence that the deficit was not fully addressed and was dismissed as an outdated calculation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that balancing the budget with an $11 billion deficit was a significant achievement, without considering the methods used to achieve it or the ongoing structural deficit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the claim, such as the dismissal of the deficit calculation as the \"old way of budgeting\" and the governor's ability to sign a budget that does not fully meet spending obligations."}
