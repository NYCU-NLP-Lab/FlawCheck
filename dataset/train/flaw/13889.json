{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the effectiveness of the treatment protocol mentioned by Dr. Zelenko. The lack of published data, study design, and analysis raises doubts about the validity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the treatment protocol mentioned by Dr. Zelenko is effective in preventing hospitalizations, complications, and deaths in COVID-19 patients. However, without proper scientific evidence or clinical trials, it is an assumption that may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the reported outcomes, such as the natural course of the disease or other factors unrelated to the treatment protocol used. Without a control group or comparative analysis, it is difficult to attribute the outcomes solely to the treatment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no published scientific evidence or consensus supporting the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc as a treatment for COVID-19. The FDA and other health authorities have cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials or hospital settings due to potential risks.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the positive outcomes by stating \"ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations.\" Without proper data or analysis, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of these claims.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying solely on Dr. Zelenko's word without providing any verifiable evidence or supporting studies. This lack of transparency and scientific rigor raises doubts about the reliability of the claim."}
