{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the study's findings by stating that masks have a \"negligible impact\" on COVID-19 outcomes, which is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that state-issued mask mandates were associated with significant decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or references to back up its assertion that masks have a negligible impact on coronavirus numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the study's findings support the idea that mask mandates have no statistical difference, which is a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict states that the study actually supports the premise that mask requirements help limit exposure to the virus and reduce the spread of COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation by falsely interpreting the study's findings to suggest that masks have a negligible impact on COVID-19 outcomes, which contradicts the expert's verdict."}
