{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the California law by stating that it legalizes child prostitution, when in fact it only decriminalizes it for minors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that child prostitution is still illegal in California and that sex traffickers will still face consequences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate its assertion that child prostitution is now legal in California.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the new law allows anyone under the age of 18 to engage in prostitution or solicit money for sex, which is not true.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing the complete story and omitting important details about the law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the law, such as treating minors involved in prostitution as victims rather than criminals."}
