{"Understate": "The claim states that health care premiums for consumers have doubled since 2001. However, the expert's verdict reveals that the actual increase in premiums for single people was 79 percent and for family coverage was 89 percent. This suggests that the claim may be understating the actual increase in premiums.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data used to support the claim comes from the 2009 Employer Health Benefits Survey. While this is considered a definitive source, the data only stretches from 1999 to 2009. This lack of more recent data may be seen as insufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the claim refers to the period since 2001, even though it is not explicitly stated in the claim. This assumption may be problematic as it could lead to a misinterpretation of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that if the employee-paid portion of health benefits is considered separately, the claim is accurate. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the doubling of premiums, such as changes in the employee contribution.", "Falters at times": "While the claim asserts that health care premiums have doubled, the expert's verdict points out that the actual increase falls slightly short of doubling. This suggests that the claim may falter in accurately representing the extent of the increase in premiums.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the cost of benefits did not actually double, although they are in the ballpark. This contradicts the claim's assertion that premiums for consumers have doubled."}
