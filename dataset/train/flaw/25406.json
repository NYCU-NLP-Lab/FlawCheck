{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there are more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining is supported by data from The Solar Foundation's \"National Solar Jobs Census 2013\" report. However, there is no mention of any specific data or report supporting the number of jobs in the coal mining industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of jobs in the solar industry is greater than the number of jobs in the coal mining industry without providing a clear basis for comparison or considering other factors that may affect job numbers in each industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there are different methodologies and definitions used in determining the number of jobs in the coal mining industry. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the data that could impact the comparison between the two industries.", "Contradict fact": "The expert mentions that the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited a higher number of jobs in the coal mining industry compared to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This contradicts the claim that there are more jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.", "Understate": "The expert mentions that the claim is reminiscent of a previous statement by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse that there are more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in the country. However, there is no mention of any comparison or statistics related to the number of jobs in the oil and gas industry, which could potentially understate the significance of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim itself or in the expert's analysis."}
