{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the CDC by stating that they are \"flying diseased caravan migrants into U.S. for medical treatment\" when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that the CDC is involved in flying migrants for medical treatment. The CDC has denied these allegations and there is no documentation or proof provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flight from San Diego to Georgia, which was a routine military transport mission, was related to the CDC and the transportation of diseased migrants. There is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the flight was a routine military transport mission, as stated by the pilot of the flight. This explanation contradicts the claim that the CDC was involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the flight was not registered to the CDC, but to the Georgia-based Phoenix Air Group. The claim also contradicts the statement from the CDC that no such operation has taken place.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using a photo from a 2014 Washington Times story about the transportation of Ebola patients, which does not accurately represent the flight in question. This undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
