{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the shark found on the beach, as the expert's verdict states that the image distorted the size of the animal to suggest a much larger shark was killed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or context for the image of the half-eaten shark found on a Florida beach.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by presenting the image as inexplicable, without considering alternative explanations or the actual circumstances of the shark's death as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the shark was likely eaten by another shark, suggesting an alternative explanation for the half-eaten carcass found on the beach."}
