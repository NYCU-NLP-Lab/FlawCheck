{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by House Speaker John Boehner exaggerates the impact of Obamacare by stating that there has been a net loss of people with health insurance.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Obamacare by not considering the decrease in the number of uninsured Americans according to a Gallup poll and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no final tally or comprehensive data to determine the exact number of people who have gained or lost health insurance due to Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people who lost their insurance plans due to not meeting Obamacare's minimum benefits and coverage requirements is equal to the number of people who have not gained coverage through the state and federal marketplaces.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in the number of people with health insurance, such as changes in the existing insurance market and fluctuations caused by insurance companies canceling plans that didn't meet Obamacare's coverage standards."}
