William Westmoreland's schedule does not align with Carson's account.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide concrete evidence or sources to back up the statement that the words \"full scholarship to West Point\" are used on the West Point website.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of the words \"full scholarship\" in recruitment ads and publications equates to a specific scholarship offer made to Carson.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that the use of the words \"full scholarship\" in recruitment ads and publications is a general term used to describe the fully funded college experience at West Point."}
