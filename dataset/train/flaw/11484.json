{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"The Capitol was built by slaves\" lacks sufficient historical records and evidence to fully support it. Early historians did not pay much attention to the role of laborers, including slaves, in the construction of the Capitol, and the available records are incomplete.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of slave involvement in the construction of the Capitol. While the task force acknowledged that the full story may never be known, they did find evidence of slave participation in the construction.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times due to the limited historical record and incomplete information about slave involvement. The task force report acknowledges the challenges in determining the exact number of slaves who contributed to the construction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that slaves were involved in the construction of the Capitol, but this assumption has only gained attention and research in recent years. Earlier historians did not focus on the role of slaves, and the claim relies on newer research and personal interests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that slaves played a significant role in the construction of the Capitol, alternative explanations or perspectives may exist. The claim does not consider other potential factors or labor sources involved in the construction."}
