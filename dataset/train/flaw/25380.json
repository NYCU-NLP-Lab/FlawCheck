{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Obamacare tax on the middle class by stating that 75% of the tax falls on them. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a comment made by Steve Moore, but it does not provide enough evidence or support to validate this percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a comment made by Steve Moore and cites a CBO report, but it does not provide further details or evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obamacare tax disproportionately affects the middle class without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the individual mandate acts like a tax but stopped short of explicitly calling it a tax. This implies that there may be alternative interpretations or explanations for the impact of the Obamacare tax on the middle class."}
