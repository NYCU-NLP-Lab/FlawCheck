{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the candidate is the only one to have reduced the size of government, without acknowledging the potential for other candidates to have done so as well.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support it, as it only references a report by the Cato Institute without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reducing spending is the only measure of reducing the size of government, without considering other aspects such as the scope of government programs or regulations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in spending, such as the waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid, which may have influenced the decrease in spending."}
