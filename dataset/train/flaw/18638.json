{"Understates": "The claim \"Says he 'strongly supports legalization for Dreamers'\" may understate Senator Cornyn's actual support for Dreamers, as there are instances where he opposed or did not support legislation that would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully confirm Senator Cornyn's strong support for the legalization of Dreamers, as his voting record on Dreamer-related legislation is mixed and there are instances where he did not support comprehensive immigration reform.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Senator Cornyn's statement of support for Dreamers translates into strong action and consistent support, which may be a problematic assumption given his voting record and opposition to certain bills.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Senator Cornyn's statements and actions regarding Dreamers, such as political considerations or prioritizing border security components over comprehensive immigration reform."}
