{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to verify the authenticity of the photograph and could not contact the company credited with the image. This lack of direct verification raises doubts about the claim's support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph shows a massive amethyst geode from Uruguay based on the accompanying description. However, the expert's verdict highlights the lack of direct verification and the inability to contact the source, which raises questions about the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the pictured geode is consistent with other locally sourced geodes and that the Artigas region in Uruguay is known for producing large amethyst geodes. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the origin of the geode in the photograph, such as it being a genuine specimen from Uruguay.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Instagram post by Nowar Minerals Inc. described the rock as \"22 feet tall\" and weighing a \"mind-boggling 26,000 lbs.\" This description could be seen as an exaggeration to enhance the impact and impressiveness of the geode.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions the unsuccessful attempts to contact Nowar Minerals Inc., which raises doubts about the reliability and consistency of the information provided. This suggests that the claim may falter at times due to the lack of available information."}
