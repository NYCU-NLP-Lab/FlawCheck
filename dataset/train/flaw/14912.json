{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the production of the flu shot caused the influenza virus to mutate into a more virulent strain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the nurse's statement implies that the H3N2 virus is a mega-bug created as a result of the production of a vaccine against it, which is a misinterpretation of the vaccine manufacturing process.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the flu shot production on the influenza virus mutation by suggesting it drove the deadly 2017-2018 flu season.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive understanding of the flu shot manufacturing process and misrepresenting the nurse's statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the severity of the 2017-2018 flu season, such as the dominant flu strain (H3N2) being naturally more severe and causing more severe symptoms."}
