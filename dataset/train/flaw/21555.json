{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the frequency of child deaths due to lack of access to clean water and sanitation. The expert's investigation found that the statistic provided by Matt Damon was slightly different (one death every 21 seconds) from the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's investigation found that Water.org, the charity co-founded by Matt Damon, did not provide source material to back up the statistic. This lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of access to clean water and sanitation is the sole cause of child deaths every 20 seconds. However, there may be other contributing factors that are not mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for child deaths, such as other diseases or factors that may contribute to mortality rates in children.", "Falters at times": "The expert's investigation found a slight discrepancy in the statistic provided by Matt Damon and the one found on Water.org's website. This inconsistency suggests that the claim may falter at times in accurately representing the frequency of child deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the statistic provided by Matt Damon (one death every 21 seconds) is slightly different from the claim (one death every 20 seconds).", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the severity of the issue."}
