{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Indians celebrating a British victory, suggesting that if they had resisted instead, India would have gained freedom much earlier.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that Indians celebrated a British victory and that Robert Clive wrote about it in his autobiography.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Indians celebrated the loss of their own kings and that throwing stones at the British would have led to India's freedom, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support these assumptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claims made, such as the historical context of the British East India Company's colonization efforts in the 18th century and the fact that Robert Clive was born after the supposed events mentioned in the claim."}
