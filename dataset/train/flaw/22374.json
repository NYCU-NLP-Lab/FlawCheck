{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of executive orders signed by President Trump to combat child trafficking. The expert's verdict clarifies that Trump signed two executive orders specifically targeting human trafficking.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that 9 executive orders were signed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that signing executive orders is the only or primary way to combat child trafficking, without considering other legislative actions or measures taken by the administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may have been a misinterpretation or confusion with the number of anti-trafficking laws passed during the Trump administration, rather than executive orders.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only two executive orders were signed by President Trump specifically targeting human trafficking, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of executive orders signed by President Trump to combat child trafficking, as there were only two, not nine."}
