{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than the study from which it was cited. This suggests that there may not be enough support for the claim to accurately represent the average debt of Ohio students.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average debt of Ohio students graduating from a four-year college or university is nearly $27,000. However, the expert's verdict highlights that this figure may not accurately represent the average debt due to the claim applying the average debt to a broader group than the study from which it was cited.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that interest rates on federally subsidized student loans became a political issue, and there were different proposals from Democrats and Republicans to address the issue. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the average debt of Ohio students, which are not accounted for in the claim."}
