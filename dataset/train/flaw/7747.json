{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Jill Stein is not yet on the ballot in every state. The provided information mentions that she had achieved ballot access in 23 states, with between nine and 15 more states pending. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of states where she is not yet on the ballot.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the progress made by Jill Stein and the Green Party in securing ballot access. The information provided indicates that they have achieved ballot access in 23 states and are awaiting government certification for 9 more states. This suggests that they have made significant progress in gaining access to the ballot.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and concise statement about Jill Stein's ballot access. The information provided includes various statements about the number of states where she is on the ballot, pending certification, or actively petitioning. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion and uncertainty regarding her actual ballot access.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being on the ballot in every state is the standard or expected outcome for a presidential candidate. The information provided mentions that the Green Party does not necessarily expect to qualify for the ballot in all 50 states. This assumption may overlook the challenges and varying requirements for ballot access in different states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why Jill Stein may not yet be on the ballot in every state. It does not consider factors such as logistical challenges, legal requirements, or strategic decisions made by the Green Party."}
