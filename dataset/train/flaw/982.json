{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Walmart's sale of \"satanic\" items by stating that they have 22 pages (around 440 items) of such merchandise, while the expert's verdict mentions finding 21 pages of results.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Walmart is not directly selling the \"satanic\" items, as the expert's verdict mentions that these items are not being sold directly by Walmart and that some of them have been removed from their website offerings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Walmart is selling \"satanic\" items. The expert's verdict mentions that items such as the \"Satanic Bible\" have been offered for purchase on the Walmart.com website, but it does not provide extensive evidence or proof of other \"satanic\" items being sold by Walmart.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sale of \"satanic\" items by Walmart is a deliberate choice made by the company, stating that \"Walmart is a private enterprise that can sell whatever they want. In this case, they have sold their soul.\" This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which mentions that Walmart asserts some of the \"satanic\" items have been removed from their website offerings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of \"satanic\" items on Walmart's website. The expert's verdict mentions that these items are not being sold directly by Walmart, suggesting that there may be other sellers or third-party vendors responsible for their availability on the website."}
