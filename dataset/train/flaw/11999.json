{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of earned income tax credits that illegal immigrants can be eligible for, stating it as $36,000 to $38,000, while the maximum amount a family with three or more children can claim is $6,242.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that every illegal immigrant can be eligible for these tax credits without paying anything, without considering individual circumstances or eligibility criteria.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that every illegal immigrant can be eligible for these tax credits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may affect the eligibility and amount of tax credits for illegal immigrants, such as income requirements and pay documents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that illegal immigrants who qualify for the program would be required to file tax returns and possibly qualify for the earned income tax credit, meaning they would need to pay taxes in order to be eligible for the credits.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the details and conditions of the program announced by President Obama, such as the requirement of passing background checks and paying a fee, as well as the legal challenge faced by the program."}
