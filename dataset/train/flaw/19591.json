{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that the facility construction alone will bring 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue to Missouri, without providing enough evidence or context to support these numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the numbers provided by the claimant are not included in the official economic report obtained from the university. The numbers were generated using a different report from a research foundation, which may not provide enough credibility or accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the economic impact of the facility construction will be solely responsible for bringing 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue to Missouri. It does not take into account other factors or potential alternative explanations for the projected economic impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the projected economic impact of the facility construction, such as operating costs not being included in the calculations, as suggested by the MU News Bureau Director. This suggests that the claim may not provide a comprehensive picture of the economic impact.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the numbers provided are estimates for the economic impact of the facility for the next 25 years, rather than being solely related to the construction phase. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing consistent and reliable information. The numbers cited by the claimant are not found in the official economic report, and alternative explanations for the projected economic impact are suggested, indicating a lack of clarity and consistency in the claim."}
