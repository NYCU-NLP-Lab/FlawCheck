{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times Rep. John Katko has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, as it states he has done so \"four times\" without providing specific evidence or context for these votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. John Katko promised not to vote to defund Planned Parenthood, but it does not provide direct evidence of this promise being made.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Rep. John Katko has voted to defund Planned Parenthood four times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rep. John Katko's votes, such as his stated concerns about the organization potentially breaking the law or the release of videos implicating Planned Parenthood in the sale of fetal tissue."}
