{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual decrease in border crossings by stating that they remain at historically low levels, when in fact there has been a significant decline since 2000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that border crossings remain at historically low levels, as it only provides data up until 2018.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of apprehensions is the best measure of illegal border crossings, without considering other factors that could affect the accuracy of this statistic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that the dip in apprehensions in 2017 was largely due to the temporary slowdown caused by Trump's election and tough immigration stance, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in border crossings."}
