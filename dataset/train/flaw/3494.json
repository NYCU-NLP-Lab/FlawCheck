{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that the Democrats took out \"UNDER GOD\" from the Pledge of Allegiance throughout the entire convention, when in reality it was only omitted in two caucus meetings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post and a misleading tweet by President Donald Trump, rather than concrete evidence or reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the omission of the words \"under God\" in two caucus meetings represents the entire Democratic National Convention's stance on the Pledge of Allegiance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the omission of the words \"under God\" in the two caucus meetings could be attributed to individual preferences or oversight, rather than a deliberate attempt by the entire Democratic Party to remove those words."}
