However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption is not accurate as the photograph is digitally altered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that the image was doctored and the original image shows McCartney wearing a different t-shirt."}
