{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of environmental regulations on Dow Chemical's decision to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma. The expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as market growth, new product development, and cost advantages, were also important considerations for Dow Chemical.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sole reason for Dow Chemical's decision was the impact of environmental regulations on the supply of natural gas. However, the expert's verdict indicates that Dow Chemical cited multiple factors, including stable and competitive energy costs, as well as the availability of natural gas from shale.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that environmental regulations were the primary reason for Dow Chemical's decision. The expert's verdict mentions that the Romney campaign did not provide any evidence to back up the claim, and Dow Chemical did not directly respond to the question of whether Oklahoma was considered as a possible location.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there were alternative explanations for Dow Chemical's decision, such as market opportunities, product development, and cost advantages. The company's statement also indicates that the availability of natural gas from shale in the US has changed the investment climate, making it more favorable for future projects."}
