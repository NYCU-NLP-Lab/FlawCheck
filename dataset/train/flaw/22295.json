{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the similarity between President Obama's immigration plans and President George H.W. Bush's actions by stating that they are \"roughly on the same scale.\" This could be an exaggeration of the actual similarities between the two presidents' actions.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of President Obama's immigration plans by not fully acknowledging the estimated number of undocumented immigrants that would be affected by the policy. The claim only mentions that it would apply to about 40 percent of the undocumented population, which could be an understatement of the actual scale.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support or evidence to fully back up the assertion that President Obama's plans are on the same scale as President George H.W. Bush's actions. The evidence provided in the expert's verdict mentions differing estimates and a focus on numbers, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison of the two presidents' actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations or factors that could influence the comparison between the two presidents' actions on immigration. The expert's verdict mentions that there is a debate about the legal standing of the current move and the executive actions taken by previous presidents, which suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors to consider."}
