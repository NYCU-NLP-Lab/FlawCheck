{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the amount spent on preparing for war by stating that it is over $1,000 for every dollar spent on peace creation. The expert mentions that U.S. military spending is quantifiable, but there may be debates on how much is actually spent on preparing for war.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on \"peace creation\" and how it is counted. There may not be enough concrete evidence or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a clear distinction between spending on peace creation and spending on preparing for war. The expert mentions that experts have different opinions on what should be considered part of peace or war spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the claim provided by the Williamson campaign is based on a claim made by an anti-war lobby and applies to world spending, not specifically U.S. spending. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or perspectives on the spending ratio.", "Contradict fact": "The expert states that U.S. military spending is indeed huge, contradicting the claim that it is over $1,000 for every dollar spent on peace creation. However, it is important to note that the expert also mentions the difficulty in quantifying spending on peace creation.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that the claim provided by the Williamson campaign is essentially just another claim and does not provide clear evidence or support. This suggests that the claim may falter in terms of providing sufficient backing.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the spending ratio by stating that it is over $1,000 for every dollar spent on peace creation. The expert mentions that the spending ratio can vary wildly and that the nation spends much less on peace-building."}
