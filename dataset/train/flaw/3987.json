{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Richard Cordray's collection of credit card accounts and mortgages, stating that he \"secretly collected hundreds of millions\" of them.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by suggesting that Cordray collected data on his own initiative, when in reality he collected it as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or citations to support its assertion that Cordray's data was hacked over 200 times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cordray's collection of financial data was improper or illegal, when in fact it was allowed by law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided view of Cordray's data collection, failing to mention that supporters, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, praised the idea of collecting real-time data for effective regulation of consumer financial markets."}
