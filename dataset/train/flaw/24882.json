{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that there were \"Muslim ties\" to the Notre Dame fire.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks credible sources to support the suggestion that Muslims were responsible for the fire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2016 incident with a car parked outside Notre Dame, which contained full gas tanks and documents written in Arabic, is related to the fire, without any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the French government's statement that the cause of the fire remained unknown and that investigators were treating it as an accident, suggesting alternative explanations without evidence."}
