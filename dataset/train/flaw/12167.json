The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced understanding of the situation, highlighting the limitations of the gun registration system and the selective nature of confiscation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Germany had a gun registration system in place before Hitler came to power.

The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, highlighting the spotty nature of registration and the selective confiscation of weapons."}
