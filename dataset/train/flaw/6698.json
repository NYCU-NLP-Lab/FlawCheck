{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of PolitiFact by stating that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was listed as the governor who told the most lies, and Governor Chris Christie made it into PolitiFact's top five of 'Lie-en Governors'. This is an exaggeration because PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled such a list.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was listed as the governor who told the most lies or that Governor Chris Christie made it into PolitiFact's top five of 'Lie-en Governors'.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the rankings provided by the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin accurately reflect the truthfulness of the governors. However, PolitiFact Editor Bill Adair states that suggestions of governors being in the top five for falsehoods are inaccurate and meaningless.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the rankings provided by the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin. It is possible that the rankings are based on a limited sample size or biased selection of fact-checks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled a list of the governors who told the most lies, as mentioned by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by distorting facts, as mentioned by the expert's verdict. The claim attributes a list to PolitiFact that does not exist and makes inaccurate statements about the truthfulness of the governors.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim."}
