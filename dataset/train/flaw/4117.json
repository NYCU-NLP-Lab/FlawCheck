{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Donald Trump's tax plan by stating that it gives the wealthy and corporations \"more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.\" The expert's verdict provides data that suggests the increase in after-tax incomes and tax cuts under Trump's plan are higher than the Bush tax cuts, but it does not explicitly support the claim of it being \"more than a factor of two.\"", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Clinton campaign's data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. However, the expert does not provide specific details or evidence from these analyses to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wealthy and corporations would benefit from Trump's tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts. This assumption may be seen as problematic as it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the impact of the tax plans on different income groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides information about the tax cuts under the Bush tax plan and Trump's tax plan. This information suggests that the wealthy would receive higher tax cuts under Trump's plan compared to the Bush tax cuts. However, it does not rule out the possibility of alternative explanations or factors that may influence the overall impact on the wealthy and corporations."}
