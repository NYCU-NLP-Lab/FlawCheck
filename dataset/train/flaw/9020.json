{"Understate": "The claim may understate the tax burden on Virginia families under both Tim Kaine and George Allen, as it only compares the average state and local taxes paid during their respective administrations, without considering other factors that could affect the overall tax burden.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only relies on data from the Tax Foundation, which includes taxes paid to other states, and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the tax burden on Virginia families.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax burden on Virginia families is solely determined by the actions of the governor, without considering other factors such as federal tax policies or economic conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in tax burden between the two administrations, such as changes in federal tax policies or economic factors beyond the control of the governors."}
