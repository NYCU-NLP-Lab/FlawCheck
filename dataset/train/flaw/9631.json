{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement that state and local government tax receipts have never been higher, as it fails to consider the impact of the pandemic and the shifting of revenues between quarters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that state and local government tax receipts have never been higher.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high tax receipts in one quarter indicate overall financial stability for state and local governments, without considering the broader context or the impact of the pandemic on revenues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the high tax receipts in the third quarter, such as the shifting of revenue due to extended tax deadlines and the exclusion of local governments' revenue and job losses.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that state and local revenues are down overall when considering the entire pandemic period, as stated by state budget experts.", "Understate": "The claim understates the need for federal aid to state and local governments by presenting a misleading picture of their financial situation based on a single quarter's tax receipts."}
