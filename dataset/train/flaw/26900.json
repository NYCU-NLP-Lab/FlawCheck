{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the reliance on coal for electric generation in the 18th Congressional District by stating that \"100% of electric generation comes from coal.\" While all power generating plants within the district are coal-fired, residents also receive electricity from other sources such as nuclear power plants and hydro-electric plants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully justify the statement that \"every single household in this district will see a huge increase in their energy bills if Cap-and-Trade would become law.\" The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the electricity sources in the 18th Congressional District. While coal-fired power plants are located within the district, residents also receive electricity from other sources such as nuclear power plants, natural gas power plants, and hydro-electric plants.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a complete and accurate picture of the electricity sources in the 18th Congressional District. While it is true that all power generating plants within the district are coal-fired, residents also receive electricity from other sources outside the district.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that residents in the 18th Congressional District receive electricity from sources other than coal-fired power plants. It only focuses on the coal-fired power plants within the district and does not acknowledge the presence of other sources such as nuclear power plants, natural gas power plants, and hydro-electric plants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the implementation of Cap-and-Trade would result in a huge increase in energy bills for every single household in the 18th Congressional District. This assumption is not supported by specific evidence or data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that residents in the 18th Congressional District receive electricity from sources other than coal-fired power plants. While the claim states that \"100% of electric generation comes from coal,\" it fails to acknowledge the presence of other sources such as nuclear power plants, natural gas power plants, and hydro-electric plants."}
