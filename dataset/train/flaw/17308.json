{"Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that they have not been able to source the specific picture of the kiwi bird skeleton and its unusually large egg. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient evidence or support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph shows a real skeleton of a kiwi bird and its unusually large egg. However, the expert mentions that similar pictures they have seen are models of a kiwi bird skeleton and an egg in its body. This raises the possibility that the photograph may not be depicting a real skeleton and egg, but rather a model or representation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides additional information about the kiwi bird, such as its egg-to-body ratio and the behavior of the chicks. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations for the photograph, such as the possibility that it shows a model or artistic representation of a kiwi bird and its egg."}
