Department of Defense and attributes a statement to Judge Kavanaugh that he did not make.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Judge Kavanaugh's ruling in Sack v. Department of Defense supports the idea that \"polygraphs can be accepted as gospel by employers,\" which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists as the ruling in Sack v. Department of Defense was related to the denial of Freedom of Information Act requests and did not involve employers or the use of polygraph tests in hiring decisions."}
