{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that a Hong Kong protester was thrown from a pedestrian footbridge, while the expert's verdict states that the video actually shows a rubbish bin being thrown onto the street.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or context to prove that a protester was thrown from the footbridge. The expert's analysis and additional footage suggest otherwise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the object seen falling from the footbridge is a person, but the expert's analysis and additional footage indicate that it is a rubbish bin. This assumption is problematic and misleading.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the incident captured in the video. The expert's analysis suggests that the gathering under the footbridge may have been related to torchlight activities, indicating a different context than the claim implies."}
