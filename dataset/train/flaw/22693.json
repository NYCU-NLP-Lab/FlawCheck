{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that it is the first time in the state's history that the Pride flag has been raised at the State Capitol, when in fact it was raised in 1990 for a few hours.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current raising of the Pride flag is significant and historic, without considering the previous instance in 1990.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the Pride flag had been raised before in 1990, albeit for a short period of time."}
