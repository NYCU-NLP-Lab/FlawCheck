{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the role of Senator Chris Dodd in allowing banks to hand out huge bonuses. The expert's verdict mentions that Dodd inserted an amendment in the stimulus bill, but it does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that he single-handedly allowed for the bonuses without any government oversight or regulation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Senator Chris Dodd's amendment specifically allowed banks bailed out with taxpayer money to hand out huge bonuses. The expert's verdict mentions that Dodd inserted an amendment, but it does not provide specific details or evidence about the content of the amendment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Senator Chris Dodd's involvement in drafting parts of the stimulus bill and inserting an amendment automatically means that he allowed banks to hand out huge bonuses without any government oversight or regulation. This assumption is problematic as it does not consider other factors or potential limitations of the amendment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the existence of the amendment or the decision to allow banks to hand out bonuses. The expert's verdict mentions that the terms negotiated by the Federal Reserve and Bush's Treasury Department did not include a ban on bonuses, suggesting that there may have been other factors involved in the decision.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the role of other individuals or entities involved in the decision to allow banks to hand out bonuses. The expert's verdict mentions that the Federal Reserve and Bush's Treasury Department negotiated the terms, but the claim focuses solely on Senator Chris Dodd's involvement.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts."}
