However, there is no evidence or context provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was actually shot in Cuba, not in a convent school in India.

This explanation suggests that the video was not intended to target convent schools in India, as claimed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
