{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in property taxes by stating that they have gone up \"almost 30 percent\" since 2012. The actual increase, according to the expert's analysis, is 11 percent on average and 12 percent according to TCAD's calculations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that incomes have only risen 4 percent. The expert's analysis does not provide any data or comparison regarding income growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in property taxes is disproportionate to the rise in incomes, suggesting a negative impact on residents. However, without concrete data on income growth, it is difficult to determine the validity of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative factors that could contribute to the increase in property taxes, such as changes in property values, inflation, or additional services provided by the city.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all properties experienced a significant increase in taxes. The expert's analysis shows that some properties faced lower taxes in 2016 compared to 2012.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual increase in property taxes by focusing on the average increase of 11 percent, while some properties experienced a much higher increase of up to 24 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of property taxes on residents' financial situation. It fails to consider the potential benefits or services provided by the city that could justify the increase in taxes."}
