{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the movie \"Shazaam\" starring Sinbad as a genie exists lacks evidence, such as no extant footage, still shots, news articles, or movie reviews mentioning it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the movie \"Shazaam\" starring Sinbad as a genie is real based on collective false memories and the conflation of the name \"Sinbad\" with a fictional sailor who had adventures involving genies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that some fans may be misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s, \"Kazaam,\" which featured Shaquille O'Neal as a genie."}
