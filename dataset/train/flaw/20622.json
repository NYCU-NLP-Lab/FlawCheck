{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Russians now own all of the photographs of users who did the \"age challenge\" using FaceApp. There is no evidence supporting this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Russians now own all of the photographs. The expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear what FaceApp stores on its servers and what it does with that data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because FaceApp is based in Russia, it automatically poses a national security risk. However, the expert's verdict states that the concern relates more to personal data privacy and that being based in Russia alone is not a cause for concern.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the concerns raised. The expert's verdict suggests that the main concern is not about Russians owning all the photographs, but rather about the lack of informed consent and uncertainty about how FaceApp handles the uploaded images.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that FaceApp does not take all of the images off users' phones when they use the app. It only accesses the images that are uploaded.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the facts and creating unnecessary panic. The expert's verdict highlights the mistaken alarm raised by a software developer and the subsequent sensationalist headlines that falsely claimed \"Russians now own all your old photos.\""}
