The expert's verdict provides additional details about the company's net worth and the length of time they have been advertising during the Super Bowl, suggesting that this decision is a significant departure from their usual practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing evidence or data to back up the statement. While the expert's verdict provides additional information and quotes from Anheuser-Busch representatives, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that Budweiser's decision is a response to the ongoing pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Budweiser's decision to forgo Super Bowl advertising and allocate funding to COVID-19 vaccination awareness and education is a direct response to the pandemic. The expert's verdict does not provide any direct evidence or statements from Budweiser confirming this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Budweiser's decision to reallocate funding is a strategic business move rather than a direct response to the pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that Budweiser will still have a corporate commercial during the Super Bowl featuring other products, suggesting that their decision may be more focused on promoting their brand and expanding their impact beyond just beer products."}
