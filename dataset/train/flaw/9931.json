{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that the claim made by Dan McCready about Dan Bishop \"removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions\" is an exaggeration. The bill sponsored by Bishop does not explicitly remove coverage for pre-existing conditions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that under Bishop's \"association health plans,\" insurance companies don't have to pay for medications for pre-existing conditions. However, the expert's verdict states that Bishop's bill explicitly states that insurers cannot deny coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Bishop wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and replace it with something better, but it does not provide specific evidence or details to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Bishop's bill aims to provide coverage for small businesses and trade associations through association health plans as an alternative option for those who can't afford ACA plans. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for Bishop's support of association health plans rather than removing coverage for pre-existing conditions.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim made by McCready that Bishop wants to remove coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. It states that Bishop's bill explicitly includes coverage for pre-existing conditions.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if there are any instances where the claim falters, as the expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or weaknesses in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim understates any aspect of the situation or issue at hand."}
