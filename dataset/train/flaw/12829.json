{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Trump's proposal by stating that it would exclude all ballots mailed by U.S. military personnel overseas, when in fact it would only exclude those ballots from being finalized on election night.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or support for the assertion that President Trump's proposal would exclude military ballots. It does not provide any specific information or legal basis to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or references to back up the statement about excluding military ballots. It relies solely on the expert's verdict to counter the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that President Trump's proposal would automatically exclude military ballots, without considering alternative processes or procedures that may be in place for counting those ballots separately.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for how military ballots could be handled, such as being counted separately after the election night results are finalized."}
