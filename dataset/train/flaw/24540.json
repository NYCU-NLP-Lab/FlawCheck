{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Every year the state loses 8,000-10,000 acres of land in bear country\" lacks enough support. The research done by the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University found that the combined urban growth in the seven counties where the 2010 bear hunt occurred totaled 4,780 acres per year, which is significantly lower than the figure cited by the Sierra Club.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loss of land in bear country is solely due to human development and building houses in the middle of the woods. However, there may be alternative explanations for the loss of land, such as natural factors or other human activities not mentioned in the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the loss of land in bear country. It solely focuses on human development as the cause of the loss, without considering other potential factors that may contribute to habitat loss.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual loss of land in bear country. The research mentioned in the provided information only focuses on the seven counties where the 2010 bear hunt occurred, and it does not account for potential habitat loss in other areas that the Sierra Club includes in their definition of \"bear country.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of accurately representing the extent of land loss in bear country. The Sierra Club's numbers, as cited in the claim, do not align with the research conducted by the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University, indicating a potential inconsistency or error in the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the combined urban growth in the seven counties where the 2010 bear hunt occurred was lower than the figure cited by the Sierra Club. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the extent of land loss in bear country. The research from the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University suggests that the actual loss of land may be lower than the figures cited by the Sierra Club."}
