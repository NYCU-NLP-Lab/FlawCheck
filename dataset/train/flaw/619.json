{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which most TV networks refuse to air political campaign ads containing falsehoods. The expert's verdict states that broadcast networks are generally required to run candidate ads under federal law, although there are some exceptions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Facebook has a partnership with third-party fact-checkers to debunk viral hoaxes and demote that content. However, Facebook exempts politicians from the fact-checking program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support in terms of specific examples or data to demonstrate that most networks refuse to air false political ads while Facebook does not.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Facebook allowing false political ads is a significant issue, without considering the broader context of political advertising regulations and the role of private platforms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Facebook allows false political ads, such as its policy of not \"refereeing political debates\" or blocking politicians' speech."}
