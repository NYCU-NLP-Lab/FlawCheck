{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the video, as it suggests that the trashed ballots are evidence of election fraud that dashed Trump's re-election hopes. However, the expert's verdict states that the facts do not support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion of trashed ballots for Donald Trump being evidence of election fraud.

The expert's verdict points out that the claim is unfounded and contradicted by the facts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the trashed ballots, stating that they were spoiled ballots mistakenly marked by voters and subsequently destroyed as per election procedures. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's assertion of election fraud.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the trashed ballots shown in the video were actually spoiled ballots, not valid ballots for Donald Trump. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Oklahoma State Election Board to support this contradiction.", "Understate": "There doesn't seem to be any significant understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There doesn't seem to be any evident instances where the claim or the expert's verdict falters at times."}
