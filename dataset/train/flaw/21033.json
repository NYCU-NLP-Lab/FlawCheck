{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that nearly half of the counties in Missouri have not reported positive COVID-19 cases, while the actual number is 18% (20 counties out of 114).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the state House Rep. Louis Riggs made an error in his statement by quickly glancing at the department's map, which resulted in an incorrect estimation. This suggests that the claim falters at times due to inaccurate information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of counties not reporting positive COVID-19 cases is nearly half, without providing substantial evidence or clarification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some cities in Missouri, such as Columbia and St. Louis, have extended their stay-at-home regulations. This alternative explanation suggests that the lack of reported positive cases in certain counties could be due to stricter measures implemented in those areas."}
