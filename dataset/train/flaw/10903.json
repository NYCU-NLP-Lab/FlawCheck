{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of regulatory filings required by the new financial services law. The expert's verdict mentions that the number provided by Boehner is not exactly accurate but close enough. It also mentions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce website expresses dismay with the legislation and provides different numbers for required regulatory rulemakings, studies, and reports.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that the new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings. The expert's verdict mentions that Boehner's office pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce website expressing dismay with the legislation, but it does not provide specific evidence or sources for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of regulatory filings required by the new financial services law is significant and may require a significant amount of oversight. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis to support or challenge this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations for the claim or suggest any conflicting information or perspectives."}
