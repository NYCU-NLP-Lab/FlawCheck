{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the increase in black unemployment rate since the recovery began. While the rate did increase, it did not necessarily increase significantly or at a drastic level.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fluctuations in the black unemployment rate since the recovery began. The expert's verdict mentions that the rate has zig-zagged and peaked at certain points, which suggests that the claim may not fully acknowledge these fluctuations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or statistics to support the statement that the black unemployment rate has increased since the recovery began. The expert's verdict provides some data, but it does not explicitly state whether the increase is significant or substantial.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in black unemployment rate is directly related to the recovery. However, there may be other factors at play that contribute to the fluctuation in unemployment rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in black unemployment rate. It solely attributes it to the recovery, without exploring other potential factors such as changes in industries, job availability, or economic policies."}
