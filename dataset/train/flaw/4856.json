{"Understate": "The claim may understate the efforts made by immigration officials to go after visa violators. The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does prioritize the removal of violent undocumented immigrants, but it also acknowledges that the agency investigates and arrests a small percentage of visa overstays.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that \"we make no effort to hold [visa overstays] accountable to that or uphold the law.\" The expert's verdict highlights that there are limited resources devoted to visa overstays compared to border enforcement, but it does not provide comprehensive data on the extent of efforts made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigrants with visa overstays are not being held accountable or that no efforts are being made to uphold the law. The expert's verdict suggests that while there may be limitations in enforcement, there are prioritization criteria in place, and efforts are being made to address visa violators.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the limited enforcement efforts against visa overstays. The expert's verdict mentions that resources are prioritized towards violent undocumented immigrants and that there may be limitations in terms of available data and enforcement capacity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some efforts are being made to address visa overstays, although they may be limited in scope and resources. The expert's verdict highlights that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does go after visa violators, albeit with prioritization criteria.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its assertion that \"we make no effort to hold [visa overstays] accountable to that or uphold the law.\" The expert's verdict suggests that while there may be limitations and challenges in enforcement, some efforts are being made to address visa overstays.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of effort in holding visa overstays accountable and upholding the law. The expert's verdict indicates that while there are limitations and challenges, there are still some efforts being made to address visa violators."}
