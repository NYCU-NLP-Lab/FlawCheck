{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Obama's votes on taxes by suggesting that he voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000, when in reality, the votes were on non-binding budget resolutions that expressed approval for tax increases but did not directly change the tax code.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's votes on budget resolutions equate to actual votes on legislation that sets policy, which is a problematic assumption. The expert explains that budget resolutions are blueprints for the federal budget and do not have the force of law or include precise details on taxes or spending.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000. The expert points out that the votes in question were on non-binding budget resolutions and were not expected to directly raise taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama's tax proposals are crafted to target tax increases on those with higher incomes, specifically couples making $250,000 or more a year, or $200,000 for singles. The claim misrepresents Obama's tax proposals by suggesting that he would favor tax increases for incomes of $42,000.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Obama's votes on budget resolutions. The expert clarifies that the votes expressed approval for tax increases but did not directly raise taxes, and that Obama's tax proposals target higher income brackets."}
