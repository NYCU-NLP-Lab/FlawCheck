{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of pioneering therapies on reducing the fatality rate by stating an 85% decline solely due to these treatments.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of expanded testing and a shift towards younger people in explaining the decline in the fatality rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the specific percentage of the decline in the fatality rate attributed to pioneering therapies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in the fatality rate is solely due to pioneering therapies, without considering other factors such as expanded testing or demographic shifts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the alternative explanation that the decline in the fatality rate could be attributed to expanded testing and a shift towards younger people catching the virus rather than higher-risk older individuals."}
