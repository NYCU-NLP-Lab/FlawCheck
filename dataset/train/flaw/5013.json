{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump opened all National Parks and wildlife refuges to coal mining. The expert's verdict clarifies that the executive order signed by President Trump lifted a temporary moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining, but did not permanently open all National Parks and wildlife refuges to coal mining.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that President Trump opened National Parks and wildlife refuges to coal mining.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lifting of the moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining automatically means that all National Parks and wildlife refuges are now open to coal mining. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the moratorium was temporary and did not completely close public lands to coal mining even before it was lifted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining was implemented by the Obama administration to review coal production's alignment with greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, rather than to completely halt coal production on public lands.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the situation and not accurately conveying the details of the executive order and the previous moratorium on coal mining on public lands. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation of the events and clarifies the limitations of the claim."}
