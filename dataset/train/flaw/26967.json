{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the issue by stating that only a quarter of Oxford colleges did not admit a single black student in a whole year group at least once between 2015 and 2017, without providing further details on the overall representation of black students at Oxford.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a quarter of Oxford colleges did not admit a single black student in a whole year group between 2015 and 2017. More specific information or statistics would be needed to fully support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of admission of black students in certain Oxford colleges is solely based on racial bias, without considering other factors that may contribute to the underrepresentation of black students, such as academic qualifications or application rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the underrepresentation of black students at Oxford, such as differences in application rates or academic qualifications, which are not addressed in the claim. This suggests that the claim may overlook other factors that contribute to the issue."}
