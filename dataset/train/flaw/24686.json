{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify if Obama and Romney actually agreed on tying minimum wage increases to inflation. The expert's verdict mentions that they decided to check it out, indicating that there may be insufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama and Romney agreed on tying minimum wage increases to inflation based on Obama's statement. However, this assumption may be problematic as it is not clear if Romney explicitly agreed to this proposal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Obama's statement, such as political rhetoric or attempting to portray bipartisan support for his minimum wage proposal. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations, indicating a potential bias.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Obama and Romney agreed on very little during the 2012 presidential campaign. This suggests that the claim may falter at times, as it goes against the general understanding that the two candidates had significant policy differences.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of agreement between Obama and Romney by simply stating that they agreed on tying minimum wage increases to inflation. The expert's verdict suggests that their agreement may have been more nuanced or limited in scope.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama and Romney had significant policy differences during the 2012 presidential campaign. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of agreement between Obama and Romney by presenting it as a significant point of agreement. The expert's verdict suggests that their agreement on the minimum wage issue may have been relatively minor in the context of their overall policy differences."}
