{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of money still owed by Missouri on the bonds issued to build the Edward Jones Dome. The expert's verdict states that the correct amount is $47.45 million, which is significantly lower than the claimed $60 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that Missouri still owes $60 million on the bonds. The expert's verdict includes information from the state budget and the 2018 State Debt Report to provide a more accurate figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $60 million figure is accurate without questioning its validity or providing any context. The expert's verdict highlights discrepancies in the numbers and the need for clarification from the source.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for the origin of the $60 million figure, suggesting that it may have been derived from a previous principal remaining on the debt or a different source."}
