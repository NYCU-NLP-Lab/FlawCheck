{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Bernie Sanders by stating that he was arrested for throwing eggs at civil rights protesters, when in fact he was arrested for resisting arrest during a protest against segregation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bernie Sanders was actually involved in civil rights activism and was a leader of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph of Sanders being arrested for resisting arrest is evidence of him throwing eggs at civil rights protesters, which is a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Bernie Sanders actually threw eggs at civil rights protesters, as there is no evidence or documentation to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that Sanders was arrested for resisting arrest during a protest against segregation, rather than for throwing eggs at civil rights protesters."}
