{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the group provided a weblink listing five separate contributions to Gov. Nathan Deal from individuals claimed to be employees of Koch brothers' companies. However, it does not provide any further evidence or details to support the claim of Gov. Deal taking at least $15,600 from the Koch brothers, their businesses, and their employees.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the group asked Gov. Deal to denounce the Koch brothers for \"funding laws like voting restrictions that hurt Georgians.\" This implies an assumption that the Koch brothers' funding directly led to the passing of laws requiring photo identification at the polls, without providing any evidence or direct connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that James S. Balloun, one of the individuals mentioned in the contributions, has made campaign contributions to a number of prominent Republicans, including Gov. Deal. This suggests that the contributions may not be solely tied to the Koch brothers and their businesses, but could be a result of individual support from various donors.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that efforts to reach Gov. Deal's office for comment were unsuccessful. This lack of response from the governor's office may indicate a potential limitation or difficulty in obtaining additional information or clarification on the claim.", "Contradict fact": "No specific contradiction of facts is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "No specific exaggeration is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "No specific understatement is mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
