{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Donald Trump decided to not work with Cambridge Analytica during the election, as there is evidence that the Trump campaign did pay Cambridge Analytica during that time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by Federal Election Commission filings that show payments to Cambridge Analytica during the election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to not work with Cambridge Analytica was made solely by Donald Trump and Brad Parscale, without considering other possible factors or individuals involved in the decision-making process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the Trump campaign did work with Cambridge Analytica during the election, as indicated by the payments made to the company."}
