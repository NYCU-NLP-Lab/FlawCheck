{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the existence of ghosts in the Singaporean cemetery, as the image has been doctored to include a warning sign about ghosts, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the image has been doctored, and the original signage does not depict a ghost but rather a person tripping over a pothole.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the warning sign about ghosts in the cemetery is genuine, when in fact it has been manipulated and is not an accurate representation of the actual signage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the image was deliberately doctored to create a false narrative or prank."}
