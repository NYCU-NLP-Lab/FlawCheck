{"Understates": "The expert's verdict suggests that studies have not proven adverse health effects of BVO found in sodas like Mountain Dew. This could be seen as an understatement because there is evidence of potential health risks associated with BVO consumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim that Mountain Dew and other sodas contain BVO is supported by the expert's verdict, which mentions that BVO was commonly found in Mountain Dew and other citrus-flavored soft drinks. However, there may be a lack of sufficient supporting evidence to fully substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that BVO was used in soft drinks primarily to help keep citrus-flavor oils suspended. The claim does not provide any evidence to support the assumption that BVO is dangerous, which could be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that BVO was used as an emulsifier in citrus-flavored soda drinks. This suggests that BVO may have been used for functional purposes rather than solely for its potential health risks."}
