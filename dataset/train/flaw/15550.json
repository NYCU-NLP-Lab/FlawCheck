{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that a search for the quote attributed to Michael Bloomberg yielded no credible results, indicating a lack of evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Michael Bloomberg made the statement about Donald Trump being a con-artist and cheat without providing any concrete evidence or sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that while Bloomberg has made negative comments about Trump in the past, there is no direct confirmation or evidence that he specifically made the statement mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the negative views of Trump held by Bloomberg by only focusing on the con-artist and cheat aspect, while ignoring other criticisms made by Bloomberg.", "Contradict fact": "The claim presents a quote attributed to Michael Bloomberg, but the expert's verdict highlights that there is no credible evidence or sources to verify the existence of this quote. Therefore, the claim contradicts the fact that the quote was actually made by Bloomberg.", "Exaggerate": "The claim portrays Trump as being universally known among millionaires as a con-artist and among business owners as a cheat, without providing sufficient evidence or support for such a sweeping statement.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of credibility and reliability due to the lack of verifiable sources or evidence to support the statement made about Trump by Bloomberg."}
