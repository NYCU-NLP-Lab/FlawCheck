{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan. It only mentions that McCain released a new strategy for victory in Afghanistan, but it does not explicitly state that he switched his position to match Obama's.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain's new policy of sending additional brigades to Afghanistan is the same as Obama's position on more troops. However, it does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that McCain has long supported the surge in Iraq, which is different from Obama's position. This suggests that McCain has not completely switched to Obama's position on troop deployments.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate McCain's change in position by stating that he switched for political reasons, without providing concrete evidence for this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or provide alternative explanations for McCain's new policy on Afghanistan. It assumes that his change in position is solely due to Obama's influence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and concise explanation of McCain's position on more troops to Afghanistan. It includes information about his support for the surge in Iraq and his new strategy for victory in Afghanistan, but it does not clearly state whether he has switched to Obama's position or not.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of McCain's new policy by not fully discussing its implications or potential impact on the situation in Afghanistan. It focuses more on the comparison between McCain and Obama rather than analyzing the merits of McCain's new strategy."}
