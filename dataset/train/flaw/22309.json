{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the power outages were caused by Russian hacking. The Department of Homeland Security and power company spokespersons have stated that the outages were caused by mechanical failures, not a cyber attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the power outages in different cities were connected and caused by the same cyber attack, without providing any evidence to support this assumption. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that there is no evidence of a cyber attack.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanations provided by the Department of Homeland Security and power company spokespersons, who attribute the outages to mechanical failures and not Russian hacking.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Department of Homeland Security does not view the outages as resulting from a cyber attack. The quote attributed to the DHS spokesperson by SuperStation95 is denied by the DHS acting press secretary.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the power outages were caused by mechanical failures, which is a significant and more plausible explanation than Russian hacking.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the power outages in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York by assuming they were all caused by Russian hacking, despite the lack of evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on the unreliable and fear-mongering source, SuperStation95, which cites an unnamed source from the Department of Homeland Security. This source is contradicted by the official statements from the DHS."}
