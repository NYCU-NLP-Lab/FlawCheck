{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and that her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget. The expert's verdict clarifies that Clinton has promised to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days, which is not the same as amnesty. Additionally, Clinton's plan does not automatically provide federal benefits to all illegal immigrants, but rather they would have to pay into the system like everyone else.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific sources to back up its assertions. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides various sources, including Clinton's website, statements from the Trump campaign, and Clinton's own words, to support their analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that granting amnesty and providing federal benefits to illegal immigrants would automatically break the federal budget. The expert's verdict points out that the cost of enrolling illegal immigrants in Medicaid or CHIP would be a matter of debate and that Clinton has stated that there should be no significant extra cost with her plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives. The expert's verdict provides additional context and information about Clinton's stance on immigration, the programs she supports, and the potential impact on federal budgets.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay any aspects."}
