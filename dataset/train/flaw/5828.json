{"Understate": "The claim may understate the risk of contracting Ebola while riding on a plane or bus by stating that it is \"extremely small\" and would require more than just sitting next to an infected individual.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that you cannot get Ebola from just riding on a plane or bus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by implying that riding on a plane or bus is completely safe from contracting Ebola, despite the advice from health officials to avoid public transportation if exposed to the virus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations as the World Health Organization notes that there is little evidence to support the spread of Ebola through being within 3 feet of an infected patient or touching contaminated surfaces, although it is still considered a low risk.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the CDC advises people experiencing symptoms to limit contact with others and avoid public transportation, which suggests a potential risk of transmission while riding on a plane or bus.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it presents conflicting information from different sources, with the expert stating that there is no \"infection free\" zone on a bus or plane, while also acknowledging the low likelihood of contracting Ebola in such settings."}
