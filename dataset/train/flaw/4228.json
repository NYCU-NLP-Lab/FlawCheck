{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the prevalence of school shooters being drugged and implies that Ritalin is a common factor in their actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that many school shooters have been on Ritalin since kindergarten.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between Ritalin and school shootings without providing substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores other potential factors, such as mental health issues and access to firearms, that may contribute to school shootings."}
