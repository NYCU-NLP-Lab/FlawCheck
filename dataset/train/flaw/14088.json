{"Lack enough support": "The claim that aspartame was originally developed as an ant poison is supported by anecdotal evidence from a single individual's experience. There is no scientific or verifiable evidence provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that aspartame was only changed to being considered non-poisonous after it was realized that more money could be made on it as a sweetener. This assumption is not supported by any evidence and is purely speculative.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the success of aspartame in controlling ant problems. It assumes that aspartame is solely responsible for the elimination of ants, without considering other factors such as changes in environmental conditions or the presence of other ant control measures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that aspartame was actually discovered accidentally during the development of an ulcer drug, not as an ant poison. The expert's verdict provides an example of accidental discoveries in science and technology, highlighting the fallacy of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of aspartame as an ant poison, stating that it works better than the most deadly poisons tried. This claim is based on anecdotal evidence and lacks scientific support.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim."}
