{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Tim Kaine proposed tax increases on people earning \"as little as $17,000.\" While Kaine did propose a 1 percent income tax surcharge, it would have applied to all income levels, not just those earning $17,000 or more.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed tax increase would directly impact people earning \"as little as $17,000.\" However, the information provided states that Virginia does not require individuals with a state adjusted income below $11,950 and married couples with a state adjusted income below $23,900 to pay state income taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Tim Kaine proposed tax increases on people earning \"as little as $17,000.\" The information provided only mentions Kaine's proposal for a 1 percent income tax surcharge without specifying the income levels it would apply to.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Tim Kaine's proposal aimed to address the state's budget deficit by implementing a 1 percent income tax surcharge across all income levels, rather than specifically targeting those earning $17,000 or more."}
