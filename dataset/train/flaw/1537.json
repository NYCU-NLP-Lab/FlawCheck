{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the surgeon's death and the Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti. The expert's verdict states that the claim heavily implies this connection through factually dubious innuendo.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the surgeon's death was related to the Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti. The expert's verdict mentions that the story never explicitly makes this claim and that the conclusion is based on innuendo.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the surgeon's death was suspicious and related to the Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti without providing substantial evidence. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is geared towards playing into anti-Clinton conspiracy theories.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the surgeon's death, such as mental health issues or personal reasons. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations explicitly but suggests that the claim's focus on conspiracy theories is misleading."}
