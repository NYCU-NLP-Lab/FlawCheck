{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Obama's military cuts by stating that it has left the U.S. with the lowest number of active-duty troops since before World War II.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the nation is at risk due to the low number of active-duty troops.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a low number of active-duty troops automatically puts the nation at risk without providing any further explanation or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in active-duty troops, such as fiscal constraints and budget cuts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the current status of active-duty troops, as the proposed cuts have not yet been implemented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the proposed military cuts have not yet been approved by Congress and therefore have not actually occurred.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the proposed military cuts by not fully exploring the potential consequences."}
