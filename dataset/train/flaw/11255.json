{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which President Obama explicitly stated he would stop signature strikes. The expert's verdict states that they couldn't find any instance where Obama literally said he would stop using signature strikes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that President Obama made a specific promise to stop signature strikes. The expert's verdict mentions that they couldn't find any instance where Obama explicitly made such a statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama did not follow through on his promise to stop signature strikes, but there is no clear evidence or statement from Obama to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the continued use of signature strikes, such as the effectiveness of targeting high-value individuals in regions where it's difficult to locate al-Qaida leaders. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no clear statement or evidence from President Obama explicitly stating that he would stop using signature strikes. The expert's verdict mentions that they couldn't find any instance where Obama made such a statement."}
