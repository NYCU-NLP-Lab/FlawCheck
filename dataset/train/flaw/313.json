{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the diversity of the incoming class of U.S. Representatives by stating that it is the \"most diverse class ever.\" While there are significant increases in the number of women and minorities, white men still hold a two-thirds majority in the 113th Congress.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the diversity of the incoming class of U.S. Representatives by not fully acknowledging the significant increases in the number of women and minorities. It fails to highlight the historical significance of the incoming Democratic caucus having a majority of women and minorities for the first time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to fully validate the statement that it is the \"most diverse class ever.\" It only provides preliminary counts of the number of women, African Americans, and Latinos, without considering other minority groups or providing a comprehensive analysis of diversity in previous classes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that diversity is solely based on the representation of women and minorities, without considering other aspects such as age, sexual orientation, disability, or socioeconomic background.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or perspectives on what constitutes the \"most diverse class ever.\" Different criteria or measurements of diversity could lead to different conclusions."}
