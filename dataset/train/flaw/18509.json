{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Hillary Clinton has been saying that Bernie Sanders is \"not qualified to be president.\" The expert's verdict suggests that there is no direct quote from Clinton stating this, but rather a summation by a CNN correspondent and a headline from a Washington Post article.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to prove that Hillary Clinton has been explicitly stating that Bernie Sanders is \"not qualified to be president.\" The expert's verdict mentions that there is no direct quote from Clinton making this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that if Hillary Clinton questions Bernie Sanders' qualifications or strategy, it means she believes he is \"not qualified to be president.\" The expert's verdict suggests that Clinton's campaign may be trying to disqualify Sanders in the eyes of Democratic voters, but it does not directly quote her as saying he is not qualified.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for why Hillary Clinton may question Bernie Sanders' qualifications. The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton's campaign may be trying to disqualify Sanders in order to defeat him and unify the party later, which could be an alternative explanation for her statements."}
