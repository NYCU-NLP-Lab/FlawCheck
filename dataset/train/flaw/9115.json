{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that Joe Biden exaggerates when he claims that Trump hasn't condemned David Duke at all. It is mentioned that Trump has condemned Duke in the past, although the level of condemnation may vary.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump's condemnation of David Duke has been inconsistent, with Trump being more forceful at times and less forceful at other times.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that the claim lacks enough support because it cherry-picks one interview to distort Trump's record on condemning Duke.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump has rejected Duke's support in interviews and called him a \"bad person\" who he disavowed on numerous occasions over the years. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Trump's actions regarding Duke.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's failure to condemn Duke and Richard Spencer is evidence of his support for racist leaders. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Trump has criticized demonstrations in which Spencer participated, indicating that his stance may not be as clear-cut as the claim suggests."}
