{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it relies on a comparison back to 2000, which was a decade before Scott Walker became governor. The data provided by Pew does not specifically attribute the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class to Walker's leadership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class is solely due to Scott Walker's leadership without considering other factors such as the decline of manufacturing in the US and the demographic characteristics of Wisconsin's population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class, such as the decline of manufacturing and the demographic characteristics of the state's population. These factors may contribute to the decline more than Walker's leadership alone.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by solely attributing the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class to Scott Walker's leadership without considering other contributing factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Pew report does not specifically attribute the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class to Scott Walker's leadership. The claim may overstate the role of Walker in this decline.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Scott Walker's leadership on the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class by not considering other factors and solely attributing it to his governance.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough evidence to directly link the shrinking of Wisconsin's middle class to Scott Walker's leadership. The claim relies on a comparison to 2000, which predates Walker's tenure as governor."}
