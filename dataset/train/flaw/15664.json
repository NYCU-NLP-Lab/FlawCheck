{"Understate": "The claim understates the cost of the dresses worn by Sasha and Malia Obama, as the expert's verdict states that each dress was worth about $20,000, while the claim states that taxpayers paid more than $40,000 for the dresses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that taxpayers paid for the dresses. The expert's verdict mentions that the First Lady's press secretary stated that the First Lady's clothing is generally paid for out of pocket, although dresses are occasionally donated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taxpayers paid for the dresses without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict suggests that the dresses were not paid for by taxpayers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the dresses were paid for by the First Lady or through donations, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
