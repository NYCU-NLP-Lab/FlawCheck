{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Illinois' overall population has grown in all but 15 of the past 95 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.", "Understate": "The claim understates the growth of Illinois' population over the past century by focusing only on the net domestic migration, which is a subset of overall population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement about Illinois losing population in 94 out of the last 95 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the slight out-trickle of people leaving the state is not a new thing, without providing evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the population decline in Illinois, such as economic factors or policy decisions."}
