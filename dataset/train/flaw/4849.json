{"Contradict fact": "The claim that COVID-19 does not spread from person to person and cannot be caught by touching surfaces contradicts the fact that the virus can indeed spread through respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces, as stated by reputable sources like the CDC and WHO.", "Understate": "The claim understates the transmission risks of COVID-19 by denying person-to-person spread and downplaying the importance of touching surfaces as a potential mode of transmission.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to substantiate its assertions. It is merely presented in a Facebook post without any credible sources or references.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government and mainstream media are intentionally lying for control purposes, which is a problematic assumption without any substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests alternative views and information, implying that there are alternative explanations or conspiracy theories that challenge the widely accepted understanding of COVID-19 transmission. However, these alternative explanations are not supported by scientific consensus or reputable sources."}
