{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of arrests made by stating that 22 employees of the Clinton Foundation were arrested on the first day of the investigation, when in fact no arrests had taken place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that arrests were made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the investigation into the Clinton Foundation would result in immediate arrests, which is a problematic assumption as investigations typically take time and arrests are not always made immediately.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no arrests had been made in connection with the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation by suggesting that the Clintons have murdered a U.S. senator and have a history of criminal activity, which is not supported by any credible evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on false information and fabricated sources, which undermines its credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
