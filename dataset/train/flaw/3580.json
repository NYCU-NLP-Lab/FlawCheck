{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Obamacare \"costing 2 million jobs\" is an exaggeration of the findings of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the projected reduction in labor stems from workers voluntarily choosing to work fewer hours, rather than employers laying off employees.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the CBO report and misinterpreting its findings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Obamacare is directly responsible for costing 2 million jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in labor hours projected by the CBO is equivalent to job losses, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the projected reduction in labor, such as workers choosing to work fewer hours due to increased access to health insurance subsidies and expanded Medicaid eligibility."}
