{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Gov. Scott Walker's estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is \"manufactured\" and a \"bogus figure,\" implying that the actual deficit is much smaller.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the $3.6 billion figure has not received much scrutiny in the media, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence or analysis to support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that Gov. Walker wants local governments to use limits on union power to offset the proposed cuts in state aid. This assumption may be problematic if it is not adequately supported or if there are alternative explanations for the proposed measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan believes a more realistic figure for the shortfall is between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or differing opinions regarding the estimated deficit."}
