{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of emails that the FBI found. It states that the FBI found \"thousands she never turned over\" and \"another 15,000 more,\" while the expert's verdict clarifies that the FBI recovered a total of about 14,900 emails, including the \"several thousand work-related emails\" that were not turned over.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FBI did not \"just recently\" find the additional 15,000 emails.

It only mentions \"thousands,\" while the expert's verdict clarifies that the total number of recovered emails was about 14,900.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for why the emails were not turned over."}
