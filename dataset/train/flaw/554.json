{"Exaggerate": "The claim that property taxes have increased by 20 percent under Chris Christie's four years of governance is an exaggeration. The actual increase, according to experts and studies, is closer to 18.5 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the 20 percent increase in property taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in property taxes is solely attributable to Chris Christie's actions as governor, while experts argue that other factors, such as previous administrations' spending and drops in state revenue during the recession, also contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts suggest that the reduction in rebates and changes in tax relief programs, rather than solely Christie's actions, may have led to the increase in property taxes.", "Contradict fact": "While property taxes have indeed increased under Chris Christie's tenure, the claim contradicts the fact that the increase is not as high as the stated 20 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the actual increase in property taxes, as studies and experts suggest that the net increase during Christie's first three years in office was closer to 18.5 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the complexities and multiple factors that contribute to changes in property taxes, making it an oversimplification of the issue."}
