{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents Trump's job approval poll numbers as \"not bad\" relative to other presidents, while the expert's verdict states that Trump's approval rating is historically low compared to other presidents at this point in their presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that Trump's job approval poll numbers are \"not bad\" relative to other presidents. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides data from Gallup and ABC News/Washington Post polling to show that Trump's approval rating is significantly lower than the average six-month presidential approval rating.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Trump's job approval poll numbers. The expert's verdict mentions that the Real Clear Politics average of Trump approval rating polls shows his rating hovering around 40 percent, which could be an alternative perspective to consider.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump's approval rating is historically low compared to other presidents at this point in their presidency. The expert's verdict provides data and historical comparisons to support this contradiction.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the severity of Trump's low approval rating by describing it as \"not bad.\" The expert's verdict emphasizes that Trump's net approval rating of -22 percent is a historic low since presidential polling began.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's job approval poll numbers are relatively good compared to other presidents without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by presenting data that shows Trump's approval rating is significantly lower than the average."}
