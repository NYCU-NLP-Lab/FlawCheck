It does not provide specific examples or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current situation, where every decision requires 60 senators, is unprecedented or unusual. It does not consider the historical context and previous instances where a supermajority was required for certain decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the current requirement of 60 senators for every decision. It does not explore other factors or political dynamics that may have led to this situation."}
