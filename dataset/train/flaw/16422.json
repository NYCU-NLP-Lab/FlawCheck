{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the threat of a super-eruption from the Yellowstone caldera by stating that NASA has admitted the risk is real and is working on a solution. The expert's verdict clarifies that the likelihood of a mega-disaster occurring in the next couple of thousand years is extremely low.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the assertion that NASA has admitted the threat of a super-eruption and is actively working on a solution. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim comes from an apocalypse-oriented website and provides no evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increased seismic activity and other events at Yellowstone indicate an imminent danger of a super-eruption. The expert's verdict explains that such activities are normal for the site and do not indicate an imminent supereruption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the events at Yellowstone, such as the normal geological processes and the lack of evidence supporting a super-eruption threat. The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and debunks the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the likelihood of a super-eruption from the Yellowstone caldera in our lifetimes is extremely low, as stated by the expert's verdict. The claim falsely suggests that NASA has admitted the threat and is actively working on a solution.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim. The claim exaggerates the threat rather than understating it.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times. The claim consistently presents a misleading and exaggerated view of the super-eruption risk."}
