{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Norwegians offer their surplus apples to the poor. The only evidence provided is a photo of apples hanging on a fence and a statement from one individual who offered her surplus apples. There is no broader data or research to support the claim that this is a common practice in Norway.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the practice of offering surplus apples to the poor is widespread in Norway based on the actions of one individual. However, the evidence suggests that this is not a common habit in the country and that most people simply throw away their fruit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the story took off because it is an unusual practice in Norway. The alternative explanation is that the claim gained attention and popularity precisely because it goes against the norm and is seen as a unique and generous act.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the rarity of the practice by presenting it as a common habit among Norwegians. The expert's verdict emphasizes that this is not a normal practice and that the individual who offered her surplus apples had to reassure passersby that they could take them.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a comprehensive and accurate representation of the situation. It fails to acknowledge that the practice is uncommon and that the individual's actions do not reflect a widespread cultural norm.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that offering surplus apples to the poor is not a common habit in Norway, as confirmed by the individual who performed the gesture and the expert's assessment.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the prevalence of the practice by presenting it as a common and widespread occurrence among Norwegians. The evidence suggests that it is an uncommon and exceptional act."}
