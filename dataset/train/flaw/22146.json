{"Exaggerate": "The claim of having \"billions in surplus\" may be an exaggeration because the expert suggests that having a healthy rainy day fund does not necessarily mean there is a surplus built to last.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert provides evidence that the surplus mentioned is not the same as a surplus and may not exceed the state's expenditures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a surplus in the rainy day fund automatically translates to a surplus in the state's overall budget, which the expert challenges by explaining the complexities of tapping into the fund and the likelihood of a revenue shortfall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by suggesting that the surplus mentioned is a result of excess oil and gas taxes and may not be a true surplus in terms of overall revenues exceeding expenditures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as the expert points out the contradictions in Republican leaders, including Governor Perry, asking for budget cuts due to an anticipated revenue shortfall while claiming to have a surplus."}
