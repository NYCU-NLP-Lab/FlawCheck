{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the legislation by stating that it would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks, even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas' marriage ban later this year. It is possible that the legislation may only apply if the ban is still in effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about the legislation being considered in Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legislation is specifically targeting same-sex marriage licenses and is motivated by discrimination against the LGBT community. It does not provide evidence or alternative explanations for the legislation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the legislation, such as a desire to uphold state sovereignty or to align with certain religious beliefs. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
