{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the nine-day deer hunt by stating that it contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin. The actual direct spending by deer hunters was estimated at $899 million in a 2006 study.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough support or evidence to back up the statement that the nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin. The evidence provided only mentions indirect spending and does not directly support the specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the revenue generated by the nine-day deer hunt is solely responsible for the $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin. However, it is mentioned that the $1.39 billion figure includes more than just the nine-day gun hunt, including a separate bow-hunt season.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the revenue generated in Wisconsin, such as other industries or factors contributing to the overall economy. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and attributes the entire revenue to the nine-day deer hunt."}
