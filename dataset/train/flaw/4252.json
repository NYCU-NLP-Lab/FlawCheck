{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Iranians given citizenship as part of the nuclear deal negotiations. The expert's verdict states that more than 23,000 Iranian-born individuals were granted citizenship or lawful permanent residency in the U.S. in 2015, but there is no evidence to support the claim of 2,500 Iranians being given preferential treatment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that 2,500 Iranians were given preferential treatment as a result of the nuclear deal negotiations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2,500 Iranians given citizenship were part of the nuclear deal negotiations, but the expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by questioning whether any relatives of Iranian government officials or the officials themselves were given preferential treatment to reside or travel in the U.S. in conjunction with the nuclear deal negotiations. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the citizenship was granted solely as part of the negotiations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama administration granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during the nuclear deal negotiations. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a quote from an Iranian politician and a Persian-language news outlet with questionable reliability. The expert's verdict highlights the questionable reliability of the sources used to support the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or expert's verdict."}
