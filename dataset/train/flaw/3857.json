{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class in almost every state with an income tax. The expert points out that while Illinois is one of the few states with a flat income tax rate, other states with graduated tax systems may not necessarily charge higher rates only on the wealthy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class in almost every state with an income tax. The expert highlights that the claim is not necessarily true for all graduated tax systems in other states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a graduated tax system is inherently fair and that charging higher rates on higher levels of income is the definition of fairness. However, this assumption may be subjective and open to debate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may influence tax rates in different states. The expert points out that the debate in Illinois is centered around replacing the flat-rate income tax with a graduated system, but there may be other factors at play in determining tax rates in different states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Illinois is one of the few states with a flat income tax rate, while the majority of states have graduated tax systems. The expert's analysis highlights this contradiction and challenges the claim's assertion that wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class in almost every state."}
