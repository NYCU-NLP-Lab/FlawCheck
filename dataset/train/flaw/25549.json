{"Lack enough support": "The claim that non-citizen voters were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina lacks enough support. The expert, Rick Hasen, states that he doesn't think it's possible, and the available data from the CCES is based on a small sample size and potentially includes errors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that non-citizen voters were responsible for Obama's victory without sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that some states have made it easier for immigrants living here illegally to get driver's licenses, which could potentially make it easier for them to vote. However, North Carolina does not allow such immigrants to get licenses at all, so it's unclear why this point is brought up.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of non-citizen voters by suggesting that they were solely responsible for Obama's victory in North Carolina. The expert points out that even if this claim were true, it would not have changed the overall outcome of the election.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama won with a significant margin in the Electoral College, receiving 365 votes compared to McCain's 173. The claim implies that non-citizen voters in North Carolina alone were responsible for Obama's victory, which is not supported by the election results.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of non-citizen voters by suggesting that they could have determined the outcome of the election in North Carolina. The expert dismisses this possibility, stating that he doesn't think it's possible.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting flawed or incomplete data from the CCES study, which the expert points out has advised against using its data in the context of non-citizen voting due to small sample size and potential errors."}
