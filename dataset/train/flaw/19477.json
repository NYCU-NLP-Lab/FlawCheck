{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Sania Mirza has to don a hijab in Pakistan, when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no pictures or evidence suggesting that Sania Mirza is required to wear a hijab in Pakistan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Sania Mirza is seen wearing a hijab in a photo from Saudi Arabia, she must also wear one in Pakistan, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for why Sania Mirza may have worn a hijab in Saudi Arabia, such as it being a personal choice or a requirement for the specific event or location, rather than a requirement in Pakistan."}
