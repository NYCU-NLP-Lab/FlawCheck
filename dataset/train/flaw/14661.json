{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Obamacare is \"the largest middle-class tax increase in history.\" The expert's verdict states that it is not the largest tax increase in U.S. history, although it does rank among the top five.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Obamacare is the largest middle-class tax increase in history. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim does not provide evidence of how the figure compares to other tax hikes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax increase under Obamacare is solely on the middle class, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is narrower and focuses on the middle class, but it does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the 40 percent figure mentioned in the claim is not a tax increase but rather an insurance premium's portion of a family's income."}
