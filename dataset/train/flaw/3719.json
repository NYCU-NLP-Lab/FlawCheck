{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a photoshopped screenshot and there is no credible evidence or official statement to confirm the ban on animal slaughter in Kashmir during Eid.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photoshopped screenshot is authentic and represents a real ban imposed by the Indian government in Kashmir. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photoshopped screenshot is fake, as confirmed by Mirror Now editor Faye D\u2019Souza. The news channel has not carried such a story and the reporter mentioned in the screenshot is currently reporting on Kerala floods, not in Kashmir.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by presenting a false narrative of a ban on animal slaughter in Kashmir during Eid, which is not supported by credible evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim as it presents a false narrative rather than downplaying any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on a photoshopped screenshot and not verifying its authenticity before circulating it on social media.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the photoshopped screenshot was created and circulated to create a false narrative and incite controversy or unrest."}
