{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of the judgment that Donald Trump had to pay. While it is mentioned that Trump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorney's fees and costs, the claim states that he had to pay \"a million dollars or so.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering by not providing a clear and accurate account of the judgment that Donald Trump had to pay. It is mentioned that it is unclear how much Trump ended up paying, as the Trump campaign did not respond. This lack of clarity in the claim can be considered a bias.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing concrete evidence or sources to verify the statement. While it is mentioned that there were media reports and a class-action lawsuit involving the hiring of Polish workers, the claim does not provide direct sources or specific details to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hiring illegal workers from Poland and having to pay a judgment is evidence of hypocrisy on Donald Trump's part. This assumption may be seen as problematic as it does not consider other factors or circumstances that may have influenced the hiring decisions or the legal outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Donald Trump's hiring of Polish workers, such as the contractor's role or Trump's knowledge of their legal status. It presents the hiring as a deliberate act by Trump without exploring other possible reasons or factors involved."}
