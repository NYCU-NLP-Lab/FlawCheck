{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the proportion of Medicaid money that is allocated for long-term care for seniors. The actual data shows that long-term care accounted for 21.4 percent of all Medicaid spending, not two-thirds as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries who are children. The actual data shows that children accounted for 48 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries, not two-thirds as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statistics provided. The expert's analysis highlights the discrepancy between the claim and the actual data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proportion of long-term care spending is equivalent to the proportion of Medicaid money allocated, which is a problematic assumption. The expert clarifies that it is two-thirds of long-term care that is paid for by Medicaid, not two-thirds of Medicaid spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may influence the allocation of Medicaid funds. It simplifies the issue by focusing solely on the proportion of money spent on long-term care for seniors and poor children."}
