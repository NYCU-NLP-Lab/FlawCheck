{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Rahul Gandhi's actions by stating that he offered namaz (Islamic prayer) at a temple, when in reality he was receiving a temple offering from a priest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Rahul Gandhi offered namaz at the temple.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that offering namaz inside a Shiv temple is inappropriate or wrong, without providing any justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that Rahul Gandhi was not offering namaz but receiving a temple offering from the priest."}
