{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the president can grant voting rights to illegal immigrants through executive order, which is a questionable assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or legal basis to support the idea that the president can use executive order to grant voting rights to newly legalized immigrants.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Constitution explicitly states that the states determine who can vote for certain offices, not the president or Congress.", "Understate": "The claim may downplay the complexity and legal limitations surrounding the granting of voting rights to non-citizens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations regarding the claim, such as the need for congressional action to change voting rights laws.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of granting voting rights to newly legalized immigrants, suggesting that it could result in Republicans losing the House in 2014."}
