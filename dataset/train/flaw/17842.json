{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that an intern made a \"white supremacist hand gesture\" without providing substantial evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the only evidence provided is a photograph showing the intern making a hand gesture, but there is no direct confirmation or clear context to determine the intent behind the gesture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the hand gesture made by the intern is a known \"white power\" sign without providing sufficient evidence or expert analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the intern's hand gesture, such as mimicking President Trump's unique manner of gesticulating, as stated by the intern himself.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on the Daily Mail's report, which did not speak to the intern or provide a named source for their story.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting factual information in the claim."}
