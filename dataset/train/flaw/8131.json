{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates China's ownership of Kenya's external debt by stating that China owns more than 70% of it, when in reality China only owns 21.3% of Kenya's external debt.", "Understate": "The claim understates China's ownership of Kenya's bilateral debt by not providing the accurate percentage, which is 72%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that China owns more than 70% of Kenya's external debt, as it only provides data on bilateral debt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that bilateral debt represents the entirety of Kenya's external debt, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the existence of other components of Kenya's external debt, such as multilateral and commercial debt, which may significantly impact the overall ownership distribution."}
