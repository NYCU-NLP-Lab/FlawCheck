{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the role of CH2M Hill in the decision to build water treatment plants to cure cryptosporidium. The expert's verdict states that the treatment plant was agreed upon because of a mandate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, not solely because of CH2M Hill's influence.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the presence of cryptosporidium in the drinking water. The expert's verdict mentions that traces of cryptosporidium were found in the water.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that CH2M Hill was the driving force behind the decision to build water treatment plants. The expert's verdict states that the decision was made based on a mandate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to build water treatment plants was solely influenced by CH2M Hill, without considering other factors such as the mandate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the decision to build water treatment plants was driven by a mandate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, rather than solely by CH2M Hill's influence."}
