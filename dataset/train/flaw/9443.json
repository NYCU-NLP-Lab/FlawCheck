{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the absence of a flag flying above the White House on Jan. 20, suggesting that it indicates the military has taken control of the government.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the flag was indeed flying above the White House on Jan. 20.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the assertion that the absence of a flag signifies a transfer of power to the military.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of the flag above the White House is used to signal martial law or the invoking of the Insurrection Act, which is a problematic assumption without any basis in reality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the absence of a flag, such as maintenance or repair work being conducted on the flagpole, as suggested by Scot Guenter, a flag expert and professor."}
