{"Lack enough support": "The claim of QR codes switching votes from Republicans to Democrats is not supported by evidence or official statements from state election officials.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the QR codes on the ballots are responsible for flipping votes, without providing any evidence or explanation for how this would occur.", "Contradict fact": "State election officials have stated that the claim of votes being flipped in the QR code is not accurate, contradicting the claim made by the Parler and Facebook posts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the QR codes on the ballots serve a different purpose and are not responsible for switching votes.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and security measures involved in the Georgia runoff elections, as it simplifies the process to a single factor (QR codes) without considering other safeguards in place.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable evidence to support the allegation of QR codes switching votes.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim alleges widespread vote switching, it is based on a single photo and does not provide any evidence of a systemic issue or widespread occurrence."}
