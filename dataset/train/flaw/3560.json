{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Muslims attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas. There were no Shariah courts in the United States at the time of the claim, although voluntary dispute-resolution services based on Islamic religious law were offered by some Muslim imams.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a chain email, which is not a reliable or verifiable source of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the establishment of a Sharia court by Muslims is an \"abomination\" and \"illegal\" without providing any evidence or legal basis for such claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions of the Muslims in Irving, Texas, such as their desire to provide voluntary dispute-resolution services based on Islamic religious law.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the actions of the Muslims in Irving, Texas. The mayor of Irving clarified that the Sharia Law Court was not approved or enacted by the City of Irving and that the decision was made by the mosque identified as starting the Sharia Court.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were no Shariah courts in the United States at the time, as confirmed by a Pew Research Center report.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information."}
