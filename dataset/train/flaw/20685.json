{"Understate": "The claim may understate the progress made by President Trump in building a border wall by not acknowledging the replacement of existing barriers with steel bollard fencing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that President Trump hasn't built any new border wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of a solid concrete wall means no progress has been made on the border wall project, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the replacement of existing barriers with steel bollard fencing can be considered as new wall construction, which contradicts the claim."}
