{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that recent state budgets have \"far exceeded\" population and inflation growth.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the evidence provided by the campaign spokesman is based on a Wall Street Journal editorial, which has flaws in its analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that recent state budgets have exceeded population and inflation growth without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The analysis by the Legislative Budget Board suggests that general revenue spending usually falls short of population and inflation growth, which presents an alternative explanation to the claim."}
