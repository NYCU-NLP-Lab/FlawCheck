{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kelly Ayotte \"voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Ayotte actually voted against stripping the companies of tax breaks they already enjoyed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving tax breaks to big oil is inherently negative without considering potential benefits or alternative perspectives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Ayotte's campaign pointed to several votes she has taken opposing tax credits for the oil and gas industry, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for her voting record."}
