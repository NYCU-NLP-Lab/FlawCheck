{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the incident by suggesting that the man spitting on the cop was specifically trying to spread the coronavirus infection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or context to support the assertion that the man in the video is an attendee of the Nizamuddin Markaz.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man spitting on the cop is connected to the Tablighi Jamaat meet and the coronavirus outbreak without providing concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video could be interpreted as a separate incident unrelated to the Nizamuddin Markaz or the coronavirus outbreak, as it has been reported in a previous incident involving an undertrial in Mumbai."}
