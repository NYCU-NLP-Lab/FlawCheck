{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of public assistance received by Walmart employees, as it states that they receive \"roughly $5,800\" per year, which is higher than any previous numbers reported.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on estimates generated by Democrats of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, rather than concrete data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim relies on assumptions made by House Democrats, such as assuming that there are likely more Walmart employees eligible for public assistance who choose not to enroll, which could expand the number of workers receiving assistance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Walmart employees may be receiving public assistance, such as factors unrelated to their wages or employment at Walmart.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing accurate and reliable information, as it is based on estimates and assumptions rather than concrete evidence.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts fact."}
