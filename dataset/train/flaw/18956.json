{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that \"every current Supreme Court Justice\" received the support of \"at least 60 Senators\" when moving a nomination forward. This may not be true for all justices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that every current Supreme Court Justice received the support of at least 60 Senators.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support of at least 60 Senators is necessary for moving a nomination forward, without considering alternative processes or scenarios.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of votes required to approve a Supreme Court nomination, such as the possibility of filibustering or the use of cloture motions."}
