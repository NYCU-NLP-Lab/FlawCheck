{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of Romney's tax plan by stating that it \"could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages, and college tuition.\" The expert points out that Romney has explicitly stated he will not reduce tax preferences for middle-income taxpayers, including homeownership and charitable giving.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's tax plan will negatively affect middle-class deductions without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption. The expert highlights that the use of the word \"could\" leaves the claim open-ended and speculative.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to validate the assertion that Romney's tax plan will target middle-class deductions. The expert mentions that Romney has made promises to preserve tax preferences for middle-income taxpayers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for Romney's tax plan. The expert mentions that Romney has set multiple goals for his plan, which may lead to conflicts in implementation."}
