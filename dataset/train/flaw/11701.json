{"Understate": "The claim understates the requirement for ICE to maintain 34,000 available beds a day, rather than filling them with detainees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the number of detainees has been increasing since 2009.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bed quota is a reflection of the number of detainees, but it is actually a requirement to maintain available beds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the bed quota exists to ensure ICE does not use the detention bed money for something less effective, according to Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies."}
