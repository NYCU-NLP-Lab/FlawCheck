{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the content of the videos by stating that there is footage of a fully formed fetus on the table with its heart beating and legs kicking, while someone says \"We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that there is no actual footage of this scenario.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents a scenario that is not backed up by the available videos. The expert's verdict explains that the claim is likely based on a 10-minute video that includes an interview with a woman discussing a similar scene, but the footage shown is stock footage and not actual footage of Planned Parenthood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the videos released by the Center for Medical Progress prove that Planned Parenthood illegally profits off of aborted fetal tissue. The expert's verdict mentions that the videos primarily show people posing as tissue brokers and talking with Planned Parenthood employees, but it does not confirm any illegal activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the content of the videos. The expert's verdict provides a different perspective by explaining that the videos are produced by an anti-abortion organization and may not accurately represent the practices of Planned Parenthood."}
