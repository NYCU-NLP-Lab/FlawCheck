{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerating Rubio's position on abortion by stating that he would take away a woman's right to choose for victims of rape or incest. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Rubio's stance on exceptions for rape and incest victims is more nuanced than what is claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rubio's position on abortion would result in taking away a woman's right to choose for victims of rape or incest. However, the expert's verdict shows that Rubio has supported legislation containing rape and incest exceptions in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the statement that Rubio would take away a woman's right to choose for victims of rape or incest. The expert's verdict provides a more detailed analysis of Rubio's stance and history on abortion, showing that there are exceptions in certain cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for Rubio's position on abortion. The expert's verdict highlights Rubio's personal views and his preference to \"err on the side of life\" rather than allowing the procedure in certain cases."}
