{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the restriction on tattooed people donating blood in Sri Lanka. It states that tattooed individuals cannot donate blood, while the expert's verdict clarifies that they are only temporarily discouraged from donating for one year as a precautionary measure against blood-borne infections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that tattooed people cannot donate blood in Sri Lanka. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides information from the Director of Sri Lanka's National Blood Transfusion Service, who clarifies the actual policy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being tattooed automatically disqualifies individuals from donating blood. However, the expert's verdict explains that having a tattoo does not result in a blanket ban on blood donation, but rather a one-year waiting period as a precautionary measure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that tattooed individuals can donate blood in Sri Lanka, albeit after a one-year waiting period. The expert's verdict provides the correct information from the Director of the National Blood Transfusion Service.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the one-year waiting period for tattooed individuals to donate blood. The expert's verdict, however, explains that this measure is in place to ensure the safety and integrity of the donated blood by screening for blood-borne infections.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual policy regarding tattooed individuals donating blood in Sri Lanka. It implies a complete ban on donation, while the expert's verdict clarifies the temporary restriction for one year.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times, as the expert's verdict consistently refutes the claim and provides accurate information from the Director of the National Blood Transfusion Service."}
