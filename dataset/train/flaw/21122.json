{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Kamala Harris proposed keeping schools open until 6 p.m. There is no mention of any official statement or bill from Harris herself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kamala Harris recently suggested extending school hours, but it fails to provide any recent or updated information on the topic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the proposed bill was from 2019 and there have been no advancements on it since then. This suggests that the claim may be outdated or no longer valid.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and potential impact of the proposed bill. It only briefly mentions the aim to align school hours with work hours to support working families, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential pros and cons of such a change.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there has been no mention of extending school hours in the Biden-Harris education plan. This suggests that the claim may be misleading or inaccurate.", "Exaggerate": "It is unclear if the claim exaggerates the significance of Kamala Harris's proposal to keep schools open until 6 p.m. without more information or context."}
