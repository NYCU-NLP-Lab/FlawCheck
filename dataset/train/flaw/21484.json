{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides two images showing scalps with an unknown medical condition. It does not provide any scientific evidence or studies to support the claim that sharing wigs can have harmful effects.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images of the scalps with a medical condition are a result of sharing wigs, without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the images used in the claim are actually from hair transplant surgeries. This suggests an alternative explanation for the condition seen in the images, contradicting the claim's assumption about the harmful effects of sharing wigs.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the images are not related to the harmful effects of sharing wigs, but rather to hair transplant surgeries."}
