{"Contradict fact": "The claim of always supporting civil unions contradicts Crist's previous statements where he expressed support for marriage between a man and a woman.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents Crist as always supporting civil unions when there is evidence of him expressing different views in the past.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it is inconsistent with Crist's previous statements on civil unions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by Crist's previous statements and actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Crist's support for civil unions is consistent throughout his political career, which is problematic considering his past statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Crist's change of stance on gay marriage, which is the shifting public opinion and his desire to align with President Obama's views."}
