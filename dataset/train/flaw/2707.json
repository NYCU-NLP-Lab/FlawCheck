Without sufficient supporting evidence, the claim may lack credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of women dying from pregnancy-related causes in Nigeria is disproportionately high compared to other countries without providing a comparative analysis or context. This assumption may be problematic without further supporting evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide any alternative explanations for the high number of deaths in Nigeria compared to other countries. It does not explore other factors that could contribute to the statistics, such as access to healthcare, socio-economic factors, or cultural practices."}
