{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Gov. Andrew Cuomo is \"stealing money from the MTA and sending it upstate for projects that have nothing to do with transit.\" The evidence provided only shows one instance of the MTA transferring funds to the Olympic Regional Development Authority, which is a routine practice in the state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation of stealing money. The evidence provided only includes a link to a news story and a statement from the spokesman of the state Division of Budget, which explains the routine practice of charging state authorities for services.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funds transferred to the Olympic Regional Development Authority have \"nothing to do with transit.\" However, without further evidence or clarification, it is unclear whether these funds were used for projects unrelated to transit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the transfer of funds, such as the routine practice of charging state authorities for services. It presents a one-sided view without exploring other possible reasons for the transaction.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of Gov. Cuomo's stewardship of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It focuses solely on the accusation of stealing money without addressing other aspects of Cuomo's management.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the MTA's budget and financial operations. It simplifies the situation by accusing Cuomo of stealing money, while the reality may involve more nuanced financial transactions and budgetary considerations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state routinely charges state authorities for services provided by the state government, including the MTA. The accusation of stealing money overlooks this established practice and presents a misleading view of the situation."}
