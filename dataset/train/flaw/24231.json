{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Reagan was trailing Carter in the polls. The expert's verdict clarifies that Reagan was not trailing in all polls and provides specific data on the margin of difference.", "Understate": "The claim understates the factors that contributed to Reagan's victory, such as significant events in the final weeks of the campaign and the impact of the presidential debate. The expert's verdict highlights these factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides one example from the 1980 election to argue against the trustworthiness of polls. The expert's verdict mentions that the 1980 upset was anomalous and based on unique factors, indicating that this single example may not be enough to draw a general conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Reagan won in a landslide despite trailing in the polls, all polls cannot be trusted to predict election results. This assumption is problematic as it ignores other factors that may have influenced the outcome. The expert's verdict points out that the 1980 election was influenced by specific events and circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Reagan's victory, such as the impact of the presidential debate and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis. The expert's verdict provides these alternative explanations."}
