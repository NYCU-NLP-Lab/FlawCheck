{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the emergency medical responder, as he never explicitly said he was given a \"stand down\" order.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based solely on a tweet from a reporter and does not provide any additional evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the emergency responder's belief that entering the building would have saved lives is accurate, without providing any evidence or expert opinion to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the EMS provider was following standard protocol by waiting for law enforcement to secure the scene before entering."}
