{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in crime rates under Mayor Ted Gatsas by stating that it has gone up 19 percent. The actual increase is about 9 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rise in crime rates is solely due to Mayor Ted Gatsas' tenure, without considering the larger historical trends and factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that crime is \"rising\" in Manchester. The data provided only shows fluctuations in crime rates over different years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the fluctuations in crime rates, such as changes in law enforcement strategies or socio-economic factors, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that crime has actually been decreasing in Manchester this year, according to the Manchester police Chief Nick Willard.", "Understate": "The claim understates the overall increase in crime rates in Manchester by only focusing on the specific increase during Mayor Ted Gatsas' tenure. The data shows a 17 percent increase in crime rates over a longer period of time.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting incomplete and selective data to support the assertion of rising crime rates. The claim does not provide a comprehensive analysis of crime trends in Manchester."}
