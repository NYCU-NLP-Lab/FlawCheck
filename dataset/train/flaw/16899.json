{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the timeline of the photos, stating that they were taken 'circa 1700' when they were actually taken between 1900 and 1956.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos were taken in the 1700s by providing evidence that they were taken much later.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the photos were taken in the 1700s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos were taken in the 1700s based on the presence of hijabs, without considering other factors such as cultural changes and historical context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of hijabs in the photos, such as the influence of Islamic culture in Indonesia during the 1900s."}
