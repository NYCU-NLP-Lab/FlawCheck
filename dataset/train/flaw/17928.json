{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of executive orders shown in the image, as the original photo only shows one stack of documents consisting of 17 executive orders, while the altered version shows multiple stacks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as there is no evidence or verification provided for the image showing Joe Biden with large stacks of executive orders on his desk.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image accurately represents the number of executive orders signed by Joe Biden, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the image was digitally altered to create a false perception of an excessive reliance on executive orders by Joe Biden.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original photo, taken by a New York Times photographer, shows only one stack of executive orders, not multiple stacks.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an altered image as evidence without providing proper context or verification."}
