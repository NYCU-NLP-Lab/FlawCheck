{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that eggs were thrown at Amit Shah's cavalcade in Gujarat in December 2018. The only sources mentioned are a fake news website and social media posts, which are not reliable sources of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident of eggs being thrown at Amit Shah's convoy in March 2017 is the same incident being referred to in the claim. However, this assumption is not explicitly supported by evidence and may be misleading.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident of eggs being thrown at Amit Shah's convoy occurred in March 2017, not December 2018 as claimed. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance or scale of the incident by stating that \"youth gathered in huge numbers had attacked Amit Shah's convoy.\" Without proper evidence or context, it is difficult to determine the actual scale of the incident.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability by relying on a fake news website and social media posts as sources of information. This raises doubts about the veracity of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or provide alternative explanations for the incident, such as political motives or conflicts that may have led to the alleged attack. This lack of alternative explanations limits the completeness of the claim."}
