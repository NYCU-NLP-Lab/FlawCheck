{"Contradict fact": "The claim initially stated that the image depicted a military spouses gathering at the White House, but it was later revealed that the photo was taken at a different event, the annual Joint Armed Forces of Washington Luncheon (JAFOWL) on April 24, and not at the White House.", "Exaggerate": "The claim implied that no people of color were included in the gathering, but it was pointed out that the event only showed members of the Air Force Officers' Spouses' Club and that there may be a distinct under-representation of black and Asian military spouses due to the demographics of Air Force officers.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately identifying the location and participants of the event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacked enough support as it was based on an inaccurate image and incorrect assumptions about the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumed that the absence of people of color in the image was indicative of a deliberate exclusion by the White House, but it was pointed out that the event was not hosted by the White House and that the demographics of the Air Force Officers' Spouses' Club could explain the lack of diversity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided is that the demographics of the Air Force Officers' Spouses' Club, where the event took place, could explain the lack of diversity in the image."}
