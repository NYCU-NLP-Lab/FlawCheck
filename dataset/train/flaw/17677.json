{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which lobbyists are involved in running the campaign, as there are key people in the Romney campaign who are well-connected lobbyists.", "Understate": "The claim understates the involvement of lobbyists in the campaign, as there are lobbyists who have acted as media spokesmen for Romney, carrying out tasks similar to paid campaign aides.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that lobbyists are not running the campaign, as there are key people in the campaign who are lobbyists and have significant roles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a paid staffer is a requirement to be considered \"running\" the campaign, which is a problematic assumption as unpaid professionals can also play key roles in campaign activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the presence and involvement of lobbyists in the campaign contradict the statement made by Romney."}
