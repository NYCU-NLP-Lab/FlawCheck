{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of Clinton's economic plan by stating that it \"would create more than 10 million new jobs.\" The expert's verdict mentions that Moody's Analytics projected an addition of 3.2 million jobs under current law, which is just 3.2 million less than the 10.4 million jobs estimated under Clinton's plan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that Clinton's economic plan would create over 10 million new jobs. The expert's verdict mentions that Moody's Analytics projected an addition of 3.2 million jobs under current law, but there is no further evidence provided to support the claim of 10 million new jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's economic plan will be fully implemented, without considering potential roadblocks or opposition from a divided Congress. The expert's verdict mentions that Moody's Analytics does not expect all of Clinton's proposals to pass through a divided Congress, and under the \"most-likely scenario,\" the estimated job creation would be just \"a bit higher\" than under current law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the projected job creation. The expert's verdict mentions that Moody's Analytics projected an addition of 3.2 million jobs under current law, indicating that there may be other factors contributing to job creation beyond Clinton's economic plan.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting Clinton's economic plan as the sole factor for job creation without acknowledging potential limitations or challenges. The expert's verdict mentions that Moody's Analytics expects substantial roadblocks from a divided Congress, which could impact the implementation of Clinton's proposals and the projected job creation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Moody's Analytics projected an addition of 3.2 million jobs under current law, which is significantly less than the 10.4 million jobs estimated under Clinton's plan. The claim's statement of \"more than 10 million new jobs\" contradicts this fact.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim is understating the potential impact of Clinton's economic plan."}
