{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Kamala Harris' involvement in raising money to bail out protesters, suggesting that she specifically helped free an accused child rapist.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Kamala Harris urged her followers to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, she is directly responsible for the release of an accused child rapist. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Kamala Harris helped raise money to release an accused child rapist. The evidence provided only shows her support for the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which assists low-income individuals unable to pay bail.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Kamala Harris supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund to help protesters who were issued citations and not detained, rather than specifically helping an accused child rapist."}
