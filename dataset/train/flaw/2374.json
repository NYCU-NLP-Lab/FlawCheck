{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Joe Biden that he can send every qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150 billion is an exaggeration. The actual cost of the free public college plan is estimated to be double that amount, according to the Biden campaign.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual cost of the free public college plan. The estimated price tag comes to a net $300 billion over 10 years, according to the Biden campaign. A Georgetown study also found that the plan would cost federal and state governments $683.1 billion over an 11-year period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or justification for the $150 billion estimate. The Biden campaign later had to clarify and provide additional information about the cost of the plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sending every qualified person to a four-year college in their state can be achieved at a cost of $150 billion. However, this assumption is problematic as it contradicts the estimates provided by the Biden campaign and the Georgetown study.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that Biden misspoke during the interview and provided an incorrect estimate for the cost of the free public college plan. The claim was later clarified by his campaign, stating that the actual cost would be double the initial estimate."}
