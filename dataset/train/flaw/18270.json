{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no definitive proof that the photo was taken on May 20, and the governor's office denies that Whitmer was at her second home on that day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo of two cars outside a blue house and a garage is evidence that Whitmer's family spent May 20 at her second home, but this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Whitmer spent May 20 in Midland, Michigan, due to a major flood, suggesting an alternative explanation for her absence from her second home."}
