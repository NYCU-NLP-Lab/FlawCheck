{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"The Simpsons\" predicted future real-life campaigns to censor and cover up replicas of Michelangelo's \"David\" statue. The expert's verdict clarifies that the show satirized previous campaigns, rather than predicting future ones.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that \"The Simpsons\" predicted future campaigns to censor and cover up replicas of the statue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the episode in question predicted future events, but the expert's verdict suggests that it was a satirical take on previous campaigns. This assumption is problematic as it misrepresents the intent of the episode.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation, stating that the show's writers satirized previous campaigns that happened to be replicated in real life after the episode aired. This suggests that the connection between the episode and real-life campaigns may not be as direct as the claim implies."}
