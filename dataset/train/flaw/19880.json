{"Lack enough support": "The claim about Atlanta having one of the highest LGBT populations per capita is based on information from an online library and a chart published in 2006. This may not provide sufficient current and reliable data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a large LGBT pride festival, businesses marketing to the LGBT community, and mayoral candidates courting LGBT voters indicate a high LGBT population per capita. However, these factors alone may not necessarily reflect the actual population size.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Atlanta's perception of having a large LGBT population. It is possible that the city's reputation as an LGBT-friendly city attracts individuals from other areas, leading to a higher concentration of LGBT individuals in the city compared to other major American cities.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it is based on perception and anecdotal evidence rather than comprehensive and up-to-date data on the LGBT population in Atlanta.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Atlanta's ranking by stating that it is the third highest among major American cities without providing concrete evidence or comparing it to other cities.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the LGBT population in Atlanta."}
