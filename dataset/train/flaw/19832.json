{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America, when in fact there were other schools with higher graduation rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement about Rutgers' graduation rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graduation rate is solely the result of Coach Schiano's efforts, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the improvement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that other schools may have had higher graduation rates due to different academic standards or resources available to their athletes."}
