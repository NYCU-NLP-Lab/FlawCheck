{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that there is \"public robbery of goats\" at the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. The video actually shows theft and stone-pelting at a sheep market, not widespread robbery.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based solely on a viral video and social media posts. There is no additional evidence or sources provided to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the incident shown in the video is representative of the entire Maharashtra-Gujarat border. It generalizes the situation based on a single incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis reveals that the video shows theft and stone-pelting at a sheep market, and 20 people were arrested in connection with the incident. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that there is \"public robbery of goats\" at the border."}
