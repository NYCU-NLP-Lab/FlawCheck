{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that 130,000 voters could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot if the online change of address had been in place in 2008. This number may be inflated and not supported by sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that 130,000 voters could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the online change of address would have been effective in preventing the use of provisional ballots by 130,000 voters in 2008. However, there is no evidence or analysis provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why voters used provisional ballots in 2008, other than the lack of an online change of address system. The claim does not consider or acknowledge these alternative explanations, which introduces a potential bias."}
