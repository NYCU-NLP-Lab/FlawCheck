{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the state's support for the Native American protesters by failing to mention the provision of two supplemental water tanks as part of ongoing support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the state cut off water access to Native Americans protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state cut off water access to Native Americans protesting the pipeline without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the water tanks were removed because they were located at a secondary site outside the state's jurisdiction, rather than being cut off intentionally.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that neither the state of North Dakota nor the federal Department of Homeland Security cut off the water supply to protesters.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it implies that the state completely cut off water access to the Native Americans protesting the pipeline, while the expert's verdict suggests that the water tanks were only removed due to their location.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the state's actions regarding water access for the protesters."}
