{"Exaggerate\n2": "Lack enough support", "Problematic assumption\n4": "Exist alternative explanation", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the motive for the boy's murder by stating that he was killed solely because he refused to wear a dress. The expert's verdict mentions that this assertion is not based on factual information and is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the official statement from the Office of the Attorney General and the Guanajuato Prosecutor's Office does not mention clothing choice as a possible motive for the murder. The spokesperson for the Prosecutor's Office explicitly denies the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the boy was killed because of his refusal to wear a dress, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict highlights that the information is false and there is no mention of clothing choice or the child's sex as a motive for the murder.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the original reporting focused on the trauma suffered by the child and the arrest of his parent, but later iterations included rumors about the nature of his death, specifically linking it to the mother's sexual orientation. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or motives for the murder that are not mentioned in the claim."}
