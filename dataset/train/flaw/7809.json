{"Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of allocating bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers. The expert's verdict mentions that the current bridge has a narrow sidewalk and that bicyclists have to squeeze past walkers or use the auto lanes, indicating a need for more space for non-motorized vehicles. However, the claim dismisses this need by stating that there is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space for two percent of travelers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allocating 60 percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers is unnecessary. However, it does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the statement that there is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space for two percent of all travelers. It does not provide any data or analysis to back up this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for allocating 60 percent of bridge space to non-motorized transportation. It fails to acknowledge potential benefits such as promoting sustainable transportation options, reducing traffic congestion, or improving public health.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the new bridge will indeed allocate a significant portion of space to non-motorized transportation, as confirmed by the county's report. The claim's assertion that there is no reason for this allocation contradicts the actual plans for the bridge.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
