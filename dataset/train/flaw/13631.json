{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that the State of New Jersey spends on Medicaid, as it is not the second-highest spender as stated by Governor Chris Christie.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by three separate analyses that rank New Jersey as the ninth-highest spender on Medicaid, not the second-highest as claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher Medicaid spending is a negative thing, without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New York spends more money on Medicaid than New Jersey, as confirmed by the analyses mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why New Jersey's Medicaid spending is high, such as a larger population or higher healthcare costs, which are not explored or mentioned in the claim."}
