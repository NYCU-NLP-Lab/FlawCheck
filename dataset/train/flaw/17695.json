However, this assumption is not supported by sufficient evidence or comparison to other states' gaming compacts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the $3 billion in guaranteed revenue is the largest share for any state in history. There is no information or data provided to back up this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, such as the specific terms and conditions of the compact, the size of the Seminole Tribe's operations, or other economic factors.
