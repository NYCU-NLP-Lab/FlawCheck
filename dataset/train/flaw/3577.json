There is no record of such legislation existing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its validity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Australia classified its Aboriginal population as animals under the Flora and Fauna Act, which is a problematic assumption as it is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation that the myth of the Flora and Fauna Act is rooted in the 1967 Referendum and the history of discrimination against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by the Australian government."}
