{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Trump's involvement in the events at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The footage shows him and his associates watching television screens, but there is no evidence that they were livestreaming footage of supporters breaking into and vandalizing the federal building.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Trump and his closest associates held a private tent party specifically to livestream footage of the events at the U.S. Capitol. The provided expert's verdict only mentions them watching television screens, not livestreaming.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of the private tent party was to watch supporters breaking into and vandalizing the federal building. However, the expert's verdict states that the screens inside the tent depicted a crowd gathering in front of a stage where Trump would later speak for 70 minutes, not the actual breach and vandalism.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists that the purpose of the private tent party was to watch Trump's speech and the crowd gathering, rather than specifically to watch the events of the breach and vandalism. The expert's verdict mentions that the president reportedly watched the peak of the insurrection on television from inside the White House, suggesting that the events inside the tent were unrelated to the breach and vandalism."}
