{"Understate": "The claim in the ad exaggerates Clinton's stance on allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country. The expert's verdict clarifies that Clinton has repeatedly called for focusing deportations on violent criminals, implying that not all criminals would be allowed to stay.", "Problematic assumption": "The ad assumes that Clinton's immigration plan would allow all illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country, without considering any potential limitations or criteria for deportation.", "Lack enough support": "The ad lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support its claim that illegal immigrants convicted of crimes would be allowed to stay under Clinton's plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for Clinton's stance, stating that it is similar to the current policy under the Obama administration, which focuses on prioritizing threats to national security, border security, and public safety. This suggests that Clinton's plan may not be significantly different from existing policies."}
