{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the bishops' support for expanding health care by stating that they came out for it in 1919, implying a long history of support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the bishops' support for comprehensive health care goes back nearly a century.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bishops' support for more affordable and comprehensive health care in 1919 is directly comparable to the current debate over the Affordable Care Act and contraception requirements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the bishops' support for comprehensive health care in 1919, such as the specific context of post-World War I social reconstruction and the influence of Catholic social reformers."}
