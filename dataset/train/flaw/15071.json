{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which the politician has stood up to Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats to protect local control.", "Lack enough support": "While the expert provides some evidence of the politician's opposition to Senate Bill 6, it is unclear if this is sufficient to fully support the claim of consistently standing up to Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats have tried to run local schools, which may be a problematic assumption without further evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the politician's opposition to Senate Bill 6, such as political motivations or alignment with teachers unions and Democrats, which are not fully explored in the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "It is not explicitly stated whether Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats have actually tried to run local schools, so the claim may contradict this fact without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the level of opposition and action taken by the politician, as it only mentions standing up to protect local control without providing specific examples or outcomes.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times in terms of providing a clear and consistent narrative of the politician's actions and positions on local control."}
