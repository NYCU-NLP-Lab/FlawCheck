{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Thom Tillis' agreement with Mitch McConnell's statement about states going bankrupt. Tillis' comments show that he is more aligned with not providing federal dollars to states with pre-existing budget problems, but it is unclear if he wants those states to actually go bankrupt.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Thom Tillis agreed with Mitch McConnell's statement about states going bankrupt. Tillis' comments only indicate alignment with not providing federal dollars to states with pre-existing budget problems.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Thom Tillis' agreement with Mitch McConnell's statement automatically means he wants states to go bankrupt. However, Tillis' comments do not explicitly state his position on states going the bankruptcy route.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Tillis is aligned with McConnell's stance on not providing federal dollars to states with pre-existing budget problems, but his position on states going bankrupt is unclear."}
