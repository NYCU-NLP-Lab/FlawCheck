{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Bob Beckel is a Hillary Clinton strategist when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence to suggest that Bob Beckel is a Clinton strategist or that he called for the assassination of Julian Assange recently.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Beckel's comments were made recently in response to the DNC leaks, when in fact they were made in December 2010.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Beckel's comments were made in the context of a Fox News Channel segment about WikiLeaks and not as a direct call for assassination.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the context of Beckel's remarks by not providing the full statement where he suggests using \"special ops forces\" to kill Assange.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Julian Assange is Australian, not American, and therefore the legal definition of treason is not applicable to him.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting incomplete or misleading information about Bob Beckel's role as a Clinton strategist and the timeline of his comments."}
