{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the tax relief by stating \"$1 billion in tax relief for Illinois,\" when the actual proposed tax cut is valued at $917 million.", "Understate": "The claim understates the challenges and contingencies that the tax-cut plan from Rauner faces, both in the Legislature and likely the courts as well.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide concrete evidence or details about how the tax relief plan will be implemented and funded.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an overhaul to state pensions could be used to fund the tax cut, which may not be a feasible or realistic solution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the Rauner budget anticipates shifting responsibility for more than $1 billion in expenses for teacher pensions onto local property taxpayers, rather than providing direct tax relief."}
