{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which 1 percent of gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns used in crimes. The expert's verdict states that the claim has some truth but with significant caveats.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the latest federal report from 2000 is outdated, and the availability of data on gun tracing has significantly decreased since 2003.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 1 percent of gun sellers responsible for more than half of the guns used in crimes are the same as the 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers mentioned in the 2000 report. However, the report refers to \"crime guns\" rather than specifically addressing guns used in crimes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the change in federal law in 2003, which restricted the release of crime gun trace data, could be an alternative explanation for the lack of current data supporting the claim."}
