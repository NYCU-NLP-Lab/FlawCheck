{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of MS-13 gang members being deported by stating \"thousands\" without providing specific data or evidence to support this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"thousands\" of MS-13 gang members are being deported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all gang members being deported are MS-13 members, which is not supported by the available data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the decrease in MS-13 gang presence, such as increased law enforcement efforts or other factors, rather than solely attributing it to deportation."}
