{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama plans to ban trucks to avoid a repetition of the July 2016 Nice terror attack. There is no evidence or official statement supporting this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the idea that President Obama plans to ban trucks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that banning trucks is an effective solution to prevent a repetition of a terror attack like the one in Nice, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the Obama Administration's announcement of measures to prevent a repeat of the attack in Nice, such as enhancing security measures or increasing surveillance, rather than solely focusing on truck control. However, the claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
