{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that 38 states have appointed state school superintendents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that it is logical for Georgia to follow the lead of other states in appointing state school superintendents, without providing any justification for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Georgia voters have twice refused to amend the state constitution to allow for an appointed state school superintendent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by state Rep. Mike Dudgeon, who argues for appointing state school superintendents for governance reasons, rather than focusing on who is or is not elected to the position.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Georgia currently has an elected state school superintendent, implying that it is the only state without an appointed superintendent, when in fact there may be other states that also have elected superintendents.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication that the claim falters at times."}
