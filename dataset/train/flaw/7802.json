It falsely suggests that ACORN will be the sole organization responsible for collecting data from the American public.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for ACORN's involvement in the Census Bureau's partnership program, such as their role in promoting temporary Census jobs and spreading awareness about the availability of these jobs."}
