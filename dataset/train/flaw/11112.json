{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Sen. Richard Burr \"took millions from special interests\" and \"cashed in.\" While his campaigns have received millions from special interests, there is no evidence of direct bribery.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Sen. Burr became a millionaire during his two decades in the House and Senate, as well as his successful campaigning and investments in real estate and the stock market.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that Sen. Burr voted to raise taxes on working folks. The evidence provided is speculative and based on studies commissioned by Democrats and liberal think tanks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sen. Burr's vote to cut his own taxes automatically means he voted to raise taxes on working folks, without providing concrete evidence of such a vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Sen. Burr's votes on taxes, such as his concerns about budgets proposed by Democrats leading to higher taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that special interests cannot give directly to politicians, which is called bribery. The claim implies that Sen. Burr took millions directly from special interests, which is misleading."}
