{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that there has been a \"rather extraordinary amount\" of non-classroom employees added by Texas school districts over the last decade. This implies a significant increase that may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that there has been a significant increase in non-classroom employees. It only mentions the increase in the number of teachers and administrators without providing context or comparison to other factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in non-classroom employees is a problem that needs to be addressed by adjusting budgets or reducing the number of teachers. This assumption may not be supported by evidence or may overlook other factors that contribute to the functioning of school districts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in non-classroom employees, such as changes in educational policies, increased student enrollment, or the need for additional support staff in schools.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the percentage of teachers slightly decreased as a share of school district workforces, while administrators slightly increased. This contradicts the claim of a significant increase in non-classroom employees.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying it to a choice between reducing non-classroom employees or reducing the number of teachers. There may be other options or solutions that are not considered.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the data and factors involved in the increase of non-classroom employees. It relies on a single recommendation by the State Comptroller without considering other perspectives or studies."}
