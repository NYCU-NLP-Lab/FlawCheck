{"Understate": "The claim made by One New Jersey that New Jersey has fewer jobs since Gov. Chris Christie took office is understated. The expert's analysis shows that there was a net increase of jobs during Christie's tenure.", "Problematic assumption": "One New Jersey's claim assumes that the decrease in employed persons in the household survey reflects a decrease in jobs, which is a problematic assumption as the household survey measures employed persons, not jobs.", "Lack enough support": "One New Jersey's claim lacks enough support as it relies on the wrong survey (household survey) to talk about job numbers, instead of the more appropriate payroll survey.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim made by One New Jersey does not consider alternative explanations for the fluctuations in job numbers throughout Christie's tenure, such as external economic factors or regional job growth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim made by One New Jersey contradicts the fact that there was a net increase of non-farm jobs in New Jersey during Gov. Chris Christie's tenure, as supported by the expert's analysis of federal data.", "Exaggerate": "The claim made by One New Jersey exaggerates the negative impact of Gov. Chris Christie's policies on job numbers, as the expert's analysis shows that there was overall job growth during his tenure.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by One New Jersey falters at times in accurately representing the job situation in New Jersey under Gov. Chris Christie, as it fails to consider the fluctuations in job growth on a month-to-month basis."}
