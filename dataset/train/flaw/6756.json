{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals.\" This is not supported by the evidence, as not all candidates raised their hands in support and those who did did not explicitly state that it would be free.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or quotes from the debate to back up the assertion that all Democrats want to provide free health care to undocumented immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that raising a hand in support of providing coverage for undocumented immigrants automatically means supporting free health care for them. This is not necessarily the case, as some candidates emphasized the importance of immigrants contributing and paying taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the candidates' responses in the debate indicated that they were discussing providing coverage for undocumented immigrants, not necessarily free health care."}
