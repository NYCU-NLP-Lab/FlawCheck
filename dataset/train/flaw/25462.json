{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in unemployment rates between college graduates and noncollege-educated individuals. The expert's analysis shows that the unemployment rate for noncollege-educated individuals is slightly higher than 10 percent, not \"well into the double digits\" as claimed by Santorum.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any data or sources to back up the stated unemployment rates for college graduates and noncollege-educated individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the unemployment rate is solely determined by educational attainment, without considering other factors that may contribute to unemployment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in unemployment rates, such as differences in job availability or economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the unemployment rate for noncollege-educated individuals is slightly higher than 10 percent, not \"well into the double digits\" as claimed by Santorum.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the unemployment rate for college graduates by stating it as 4.4 percent, while the expert's analysis does not provide the specific unemployment rate for college graduates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing incomplete or inaccurate information, such as not providing a breakdown for \"blue-collar\" workers or not specifying the unemployment rate for college graduates."}
