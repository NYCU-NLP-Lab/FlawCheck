The expert's verdict mentions a bug on the part of the third-party data company that contributed to the security lapse.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the DNC pledged to restore the Sanders campaign's access to the voter files, suggesting that the access may not have been deliberate or improper.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a one-sided view of the situation without considering other perspectives or factors. The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive analysis of the incident."}
