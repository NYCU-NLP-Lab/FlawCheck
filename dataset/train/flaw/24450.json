{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the progressiveness of Vermont's tax system by stating it is the most progressive in the country, without sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no research that concludes Vermont's tax system is the most progressive.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations provided, such as California and Delaware having more progressive tax systems, suggesting that Vermont may not have the most progressive system.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Vermont's tax system is not conclusively the most progressive, as suggested by tax policy experts and research.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it is based on a presentation by the Vermont Department of Taxes, which itself relies on a study and a graph that do not consistently rank Vermont as having the most progressive tax system.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the people Governor Scott is talking to believe they are paying their fair share and more, which may not be a universally held belief."}
