{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Romney wants to \"take away early childhood education, slash K-12 funding, and cut college aid\" in order to pay for a tax break for multi-millionaires. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that Romney's intentions are solely focused on benefiting the wealthy at the expense of education.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence provided in the expert's verdict that directly contradicts the claim. However, it is possible that the claim may understate the complexity of the budget proposal and the potential impact on education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Romney wants to make these cuts in education to fund a tax break for multi-millionaires. It lacks enough support to fully substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's intention is solely to provide a tax break for multi-millionaires, without considering other potential reasons or motivations behind his proposed budget cuts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claims about education in the ad refer to the budget proposed by Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the proposed cuts in education, such as the influence of Ryan's budget proposal."}
