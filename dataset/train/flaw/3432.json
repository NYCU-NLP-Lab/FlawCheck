{"Understate": "The claim understates the time it took for people to receive the first Social Security check. The expert's verdict states that it actually took seven years before the first check was issued, while the claim does not accurately reflect this timeline.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that \"Social Security took seven years before anybody got the first check.\" It lacks sufficient support to validate the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Congress amended the original Social Security Act to begin dispensing monthly checks in 1940, as stated by the Social Security Administration. The expert's verdict deems the claim as \"Mostly False\" due to this contradiction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the delay in issuing the first Social Security check was due to inefficiency or other negative factors. However, the expert's verdict highlights the legal and operational challenges that the Social Security program faced, which were not mentioned in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the delay in issuing the first Social Security check, such as the legal complexities and unprecedented record-keeping involved in implementing the program. These alternative explanations are mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
