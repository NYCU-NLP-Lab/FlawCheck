{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to find a single, definitive source of data to support the claim that only 35 to 40 percent of applicants pass the high school level test to join the military.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pass rate for the high school level test to join the military is 35 to 40 percent, without providing sufficient evidence or sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that health, including obesity, is a significant disqualifying factor for military applicants. This suggests that factors other than the test itself, such as health issues, may contribute to the pass rate.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that Bush's spokeswoman clarified that he actually meant to say that about one-third fail the test, rather than pass it. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the pass rate is 35 to 40 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the pass rate by stating that it is only 35 to 40 percent, without considering other factors or variations across different branches of the military.", "Exaggerate": "While not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, the claim's use of words like \"abysmal\" and \"horrific\" to describe the pass rate could be seen as an exaggeration, especially considering the lack of concrete data supporting the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim falters by not providing enough evidence or sources to support the stated pass rate, and by potentially miscommunicating the actual pass/fail rate."}
