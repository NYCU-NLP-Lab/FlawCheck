{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the investment in education is the highest ever in the history of Wisconsin, which may not be entirely accurate based on inflation-adjusted data from previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement. The expert had to conduct research and gather data from various sources to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the investment in education is solely measured by the amount of money allocated to K-12 education and does not consider other factors or types of education funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in education funding, such as changes in federal funding or adjustments in the state's budget priorities, which may not necessarily indicate a historical high in investment.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of education funding over the entire history of Wisconsin. It only focuses on a specific period and may not accurately represent the long-term trends.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the highest inflation-adjusted year for state aid to schools in Wisconsin was in fiscal year 2003, according to data from the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. This contradicts the claim that the current investment is the highest ever."}
