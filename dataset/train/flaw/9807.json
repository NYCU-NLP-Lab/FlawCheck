This assumption is problematic as it presents the deficit as a concrete fact, while it is a projection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the financial numbers presented by the claim. The numbers cited by the claim and the evidence provided do not align accurately, raising doubts about the claim's accuracy and suggesting alternative explanations for the state's financial situation."}
