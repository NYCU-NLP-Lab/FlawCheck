{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the Indian flag being raised by Congress supporters during the Capitol Hill rioting. It presents controversy and sparks a narrative around the incident, potentially amplifying its importance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to establish a clear link between the man who waved the Indian flag and his support for Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. It relies on statements from media channels and social media users without presenting concrete proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man who raised the Indian flag is a supporter of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor based on his alleged association with him. However, this association may not necessarily indicate political support or affiliation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests an alternative explanation for the man's actions, linking it to his support for Congress MP Shashi Tharoor rather than the broader context of the Capitol Hill rioting and the motivations of the Trump supporters involved."}
