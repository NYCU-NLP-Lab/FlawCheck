{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the original source of the statistic provided by West Virginia University President E. Gordon Gee could not be identified. The data used to estimate the number of job openings and the percentage requiring advanced skills is also acknowledged as experimental and estimated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there are 20,000 jobs in West Virginia that don't have skilled workers, but the data used to estimate the percentage of job openings requiring advanced skills is from 2010 and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 38,000 job openings in West Virginia may not necessarily all require advanced skills. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the perceived lack of skilled workers in the state."}
