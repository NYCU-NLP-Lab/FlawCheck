{"Lack enough support": "The claim that hospitals in North Carolina are typically 85% full does not have enough supporting evidence. The experts could not find a specific number to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hospitals operating at 85% capacity is a major problem, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts provide alternative explanations for the high occupancy rates, such as the closure and downsizing of rural hospitals and the overall decrease in available beds in the U.S.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear definition of capacity and how it is measured, leading to potential discrepancies in understanding.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statistics provided by the North Carolina Health Association, which states that the average hospital occupancy rate in North Carolina was 61% in 2018, lower than the claimed 85%.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual occupancy rates by providing a lower estimate than what is suggested by the experts and statistics.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the problem by stating that it is a \"major problem\" without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this claim."}
