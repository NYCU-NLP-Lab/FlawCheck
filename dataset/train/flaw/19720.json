{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the speed at which $60 billion in aid was approved after Hurricane Katrina. While some of the aid was approved within 10 days, not all of it was approved on a voice vote, as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that all $60 billion in aid was approved on a voice vote.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval process for Hurricane Katrina aid was the same as the process for Hurricane Sandy aid, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that most of the $60 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina was approved through recorded votes, not solely on a voice vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the approval process of Hurricane Katrina aid, which involved both voice votes and recorded votes."}
