{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that big pharmaceuticals \"literally pay off\" generics to keep prices and competition off the market. While it is true that pharmaceutical companies compensate generic competitors to delay marketing their drugs, the claim may be exaggerated in its wording.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the practice of pay-for-delay is widespread and occurring in all cases. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the details of such settlements are secret, and not all pharmaceutical companies engage in pay-for-delay tactics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that big pharmaceuticals are paying off generics to keep prices and competition off the market. The expert's verdict provides some examples, but the claim itself does not provide enough support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for high drug prices and limited competition in the market. It solely focuses on the practice of pay-for-delay, without exploring other factors that may contribute to the issue."}
