{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the decrease in the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States by stating it has decreased by nearly 40 percent, while the expert's verdict shows it has actually declined by 39 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that the number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has plummeted by nearly 70 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in firearm-related homicides and crimes is solely due to more responsible families owning guns, which is a problematic assumption as there are other factors that could contribute to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the decrease in firearm-related homicides and crimes, such as better policing or a decline in the crack cocaine epidemic.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's verdict by stating that society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns, while the expert's verdict states that it is uncertain if society is actually safer as a result.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering other statistics, such as suicides, that could provide a fuller picture of firearms policy and safety.", "Exaggerates": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of more responsible families owning guns on the decrease in firearm-related homicides and crimes, as it does not consider other potential factors."}
