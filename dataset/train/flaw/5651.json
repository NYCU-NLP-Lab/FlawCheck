{"Lack enough support": "The claim that poor people are less likely to use drugs is not supported by the data obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which found that a higher proportion of persons living in poverty used illicit drugs compared to persons with higher incomes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that poverty is a deterrent to drug use, without considering other factors that may contribute to drug use among different socioeconomic groups.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which shows that a higher proportion of persons living in poverty actually use illicit drugs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The data obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health suggests that factors other than poverty, such as unemployment, may be more strongly associated with higher rates of drug use.", "Understate": "The claim understates the prevalence of drug use among poor individuals by suggesting that they are less likely to use drugs than people with means, when the data shows the opposite.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its attempt to support the assertion that poor people are less likely to use drugs, as the data obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health does not align with this claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
