{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost of infant childcare by stating that it is \"more than most families pay in rent\" and \"almost the same cost as in-state college tuition.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the figures provided by the candidate are accurate, but the claim may still be seen as exaggerating the comparison.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by figures from a Child Care Aware of America report, but it does not provide additional evidence or sources to support the comparison made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of infant childcare being higher than rent and similar to in-state college tuition is a problem that requires more support for working class families. This assumption may be seen as problematic if there are other factors to consider or alternative explanations for the cost disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the high cost of infant childcare, such as factors related to quality, regulations, or market dynamics."}
