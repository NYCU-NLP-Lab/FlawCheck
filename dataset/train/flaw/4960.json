{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential benefits of a proposed wall on the southern border, stating that it \"will pay for itself\" without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the proposed wall will pay for itself. The report it cites is contested, and several members involved in creating the report have objected to the way their data were used to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that keeping out illegal immigrants will result in significant cost savings for the government. However, the actual cost of immigrants in the future is highly speculative and depends on various assumptions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that several creators of the report cited have stated that their data are being misused and that keeping out illegal immigrants might actually cost the government money over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that the proposed wall will pay for itself. The alternative explanation is that the cost of the wall may outweigh any potential savings from reducing illegal immigration."}
