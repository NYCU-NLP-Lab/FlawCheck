{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a blog post and survey results from the Wisconsin Technical College System, which may not be representative of all technical college graduates or four-year college graduates nationwide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher employment rates and starting salaries for technical college graduates in Wisconsin compared to four-year college graduates are indicative of the nationwide trend, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the higher employment rates and starting salaries of technical college graduates in Wisconsin, such as regional economic factors or industry-specific demand, which are not addressed in the claim."}
