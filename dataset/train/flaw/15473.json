{"Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the lack of rainfall in large parts of Florida by simply stating that they have experienced \"years of below average rainfall.\" The expert's verdict provides more details about the impact of this lack of rainfall on the state's water supply and the attention it has drawn from various groups.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"large parts of Florida\" have experienced below average rainfall for years. The expert's verdict provides some information about statewide rainfall totals and regional rainfall measures, but it does not directly support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of rainfall is the main factor contributing to the growing shortfall in water supply across the state. While the expert's verdict mentions reduced infrastructure spending during the recession as another contributing factor, it does not provide enough information to determine if this assumption is accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduced water supply in Florida. The expert's verdict mentions overpumping by homes and industries during dry spells as another factor affecting the Floridan Aquifer, but it does not explore other potential causes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not explicitly contradict any facts provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the lack of rainfall in large parts of Florida, as the expert's verdict confirms that there have been years of below-average rainfall statewide.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not contain any specific information or statements that suggest it falters at times."}
