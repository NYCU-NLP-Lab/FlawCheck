{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which more college graduates are living at home than in decades. The claim states that \"more\" college graduates are living at home, but it does not provide specific data or evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that more college graduates are living at home than in decades. It only provides a statement made by Governor Cuomo without any additional sources or statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in college graduates living at home is solely due to student debt. It states that graduates with less debt are more likely to afford living on their own, but it does not consider other factors that may contribute to graduates living at home, such as job availability or economic factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in college graduates living at home, such as changes in cultural norms or societal expectations. It solely focuses on the issue of student debt as the primary reason for this trend.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and concise argument. It includes information about Governor Cuomo's push for tuition-free public college, but it does not directly connect this to the claim about college graduates living at home.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the increase in college graduates living at home. While it mentions that the percentage is the highest since the 1940s, it does not emphasize the potential impact or implications of this trend.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts, as it is based on a statement made by Governor Cuomo. However, it lacks sufficient evidence to support the claim, which may contradict the factuality of the statement."}
