{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the study mentioned was not peer-reviewed, published, or meant to be taken seriously. There are no follow-up studies replicating its findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that watching horror movies can be a good weight-loss strategy, without considering other factors such as diet and exercise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in calorie consumption, such as the adrenaline rush caused by the movies, rather than a direct link to reducing the risk of obesity.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a study commissioned by a movie rental service with a clear aim of increasing video sales.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of exercise for weight loss, suggesting that watching horror movies alone can be an effective strategy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no peer-reviewed or published studies supporting the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of watching horror movies on calorie consumption and reducing the risk of obesity, without sufficient evidence to support it."}
