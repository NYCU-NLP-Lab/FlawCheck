{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of new local jobs that will be created by the stadium renovation. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim of \"more than 4,000 new local jobs\" has been repeated multiple times and is being used as a selling point by the Dolphins to gain support for financing.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may not be enough evidence or support to back up the claim of creating over 4,000 new local jobs. The mailer distributed by the stadium's political action committee is mentioned, but it is not clear if there is any independent research or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the stadium renovation will directly lead to the creation of more than 4,000 new local jobs. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there is no financial penalty if the team doesn't meet the local hiring goals and there is no requirement regarding the sheer number of jobs. This raises questions about the assumption that the renovation will automatically result in the claimed number of jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention alternative explanations for the claim, but it does highlight the financial interests of the Dolphins and their political action committee in promoting the job creation figure. This suggests that there may be alternative motivations for making the claim, such as gaining public support for financing.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state that the claim falters at times, but it does highlight the omission of certain financial amounts in the mailer, which could be seen as a potential weakness or inconsistency in the claim."}
