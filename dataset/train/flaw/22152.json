{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the candidate's residency in Milwaukee by stating that he has lived there for all 61 years of his life, when evidence suggests that he actually lives in a suburb.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that living in Milwaukee for a long time automatically qualifies the candidate to understand and address the issues faced by the city's residents, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to validate the candidate's statement about living in Milwaukee for his entire life, as there is conflicting information about his actual residence in a suburb.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the candidate may have a primary residence in the suburb but still have strong connections to and involvement in the city of Milwaukee."}
