{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Trump's opposition to the Iraq War by stating that he opposed it \"from the beginning\" based on a TV interview where he did not express a clear opinion on whether the U.S. should invade.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a TV interview where Trump discussed the economy and criticized the Bush administration's handling of the decision on whether to invade Iraq proves his opposition to the war.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to Trump's statements in the TV interview is that he was criticizing the handling of the decision on whether to invade Iraq rather than expressing opposition to the war itself."}
