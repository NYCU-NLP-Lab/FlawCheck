{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the incident by describing it as \"brutal\" and stating that the victim's health is in critical condition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident is caste-based violence between Thakurs and Jatavs, without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a video circulating on social media, but there is no additional evidence or sources provided to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that the incident was not caste-based violence, but rather a conflict between bootleggers of illicit liquor. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the incident."}
