{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the relationship between missing persons and cave systems by presenting it as a strong correlation.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the map of missing persons is not comprehensive and only focuses on \"strange\" disappearances near national parks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that most people in the United States go missing near cave systems.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between the proximity to cave systems and the disappearance of individuals, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that correlation does not imply causation, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the similarities between the maps."}
