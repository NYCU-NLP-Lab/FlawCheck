{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the problem by stating that all 52 counties have average taxes above the SALT $10,000 cap.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately conveying the impact of the SALT deduction cap, as it fails to mention that many tax filers do not itemize their deductions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that all 52 counties have average taxes above the SALT $10,000 cap.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average taxes above the SALT $10,000 cap in 52 counties automatically translate to a tax increase for all residents in those counties.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the average taxes above the SALT $10,000 cap, such as variations in income levels or property values across counties."}
