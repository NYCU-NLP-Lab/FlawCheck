The video provided in the claim does not show any evidence of Pascual's death and is taken from a 2015 news report that does not mention him.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing a carjacking incident is related to the death of Piolo Pascual, without any solid evidence or connection between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it is taken from a 2015 news report that does not involve Piolo Pascual.
