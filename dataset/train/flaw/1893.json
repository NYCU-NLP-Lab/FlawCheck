{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the difference in the number of high-skilled visas issued by Canada compared to the United States. While it is true that Canada issues more high-skilled visas, the claim may overstate the difference by emphasizing the large gap between the numbers (150,000 vs. 65,000).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the comparison between Canada and the United States in terms of high-skilled visas. It does not provide additional information on the sources or methodology used to arrive at the numbers mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of high-skilled visas issued by Canada is directly comparable to the H-1B visa program in the United States. However, the claim fails to acknowledge the differences in immigration policies and pathways between the two countries, making the comparison somewhat problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the number of high-skilled visas issued by Canada and the United States. Factors such as population size, economic needs, and immigration policies may contribute to the disparity, but the claim does not explore these possibilities."}
