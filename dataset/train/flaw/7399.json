{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video shows an Italian child shouting for his mother who died because of COVID-19 is contradicted by evidence that the boy is speaking Spanish, not Italian, and that the video was published before Italy recorded its first COVID-19 death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to directly link the child in the video to a mother who died from COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the child in the video is shouting for his mother who died because of COVID-19 based on his pointing to the sky and the caption of the post. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the child's behavior in the video, such as him pointing to the sky for other reasons unrelated to his mother's death.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the emotional impact of the video by stating that viewers will feel \"so sad\" without providing evidence or data to support this claim.", "Understate": "There doesn't appear to be any bias of understating in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
