{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of high-quality, early education programs by stating that every dollar invested can save more than $7 later on. The expert's verdict questions whether this math is correct and suggests that the claim may be overstating the economic benefits.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that a White House official referred to a recent report on a long-term study, but it does not provide specific details or evidence to support the claim. This lack of sufficient support raises doubts about the validity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high-quality, early education programs can directly and significantly impact graduation rates, teen pregnancy, and crime reduction. However, the expert's verdict questions whether these assumptions are valid and whether the claimed benefits can be solely attributed to such programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that others have questioned the efforts to implement universal preschool programs, citing cost and results. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the outcomes mentioned in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "While not explicitly stated, the expert's verdict raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim's math and the validity of the economic benefits attributed to high-quality, early education programs. This contradiction to the claim's statements indicates a potential bias."}
