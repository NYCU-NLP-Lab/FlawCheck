{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the frozen waterfall is a result of the recent Texas storm. The evidence provided includes social media posts and a reverse image search, but none of them conclusively prove the connection between the storm and the frozen waterfall.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive explanation for the frozen waterfall. The expert's verdict mentions that the image is not recent, and there is uncertainty about the location and origin of the picture.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the image has been shared online in previous years, with some posts claiming it was taken in New York or Wisconsin. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the frozen waterfall, unrelated to the Texas storm.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image is not recent and has been shared online prior to the Texas storm. This undermines the claim's assertion that the frozen waterfall is a result of the recent storm.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the frozen waterfall by associating it directly with the Texas storm without sufficient evidence or confirmation of its connection.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
