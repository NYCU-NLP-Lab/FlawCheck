{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs lost in Michigan due to the Obama-Clinton war on coal. The number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or data provided to back up the assertion that over 50,000 jobs have been lost due to the Obama-Clinton war on coal in Michigan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama-Clinton war on coal is the sole reason for job losses in Michigan, without considering other factors that could have contributed to job changes in the mining and electricity generation sectors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for job losses in Michigan, such as changes in market demand, technological advancements, or shifts in energy production preferences.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Michigan is not one of the premier coal-producing states and is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Obama-Clinton war on coal would have a significant impact on job losses in the coal industry in Michigan."}
