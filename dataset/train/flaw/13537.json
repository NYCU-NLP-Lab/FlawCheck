{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential job creation impact of the health care bill by stating that it will create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately. The expert's verdict highlights that both sides make claims about job creation, but the actual impact is likely to be smaller.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cheaper health care will automatically lead to businesses hiring more workers and creating more jobs. This assumption may not hold true in all cases, as other factors can influence hiring decisions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the health care bill will create 4 million jobs. The expert's verdict mentions estimates from Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and older studies, but these do not provide a definitive basis for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Republicans argue that the health care bill could lead to job losses due to fines imposed on employers. This alternative explanation suggests that the impact on job creation is not a straightforward issue."}
