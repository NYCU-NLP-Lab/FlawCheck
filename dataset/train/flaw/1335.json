{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's advocacy for lowering the age of consent. While the claim attributes the quote directly to Ginsburg, the evidence provided suggests that she was involved in a report that discussed the need to remove sex bias in laws, including the age of consent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ginsburg's involvement in a report discussing the age of consent implies her personal endorsement of lowering it to age 12. However, the evidence provided does not explicitly support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Ginsburg advocated for lowering the age of consent to 12 years old. The evidence only suggests her involvement in a report that discussed the need for sex-neutral laws.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for Ginsburg's involvement in the report could be her commitment to removing sex bias in laws rather than specifically advocating for lowering the age of consent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing Ginsburg's position by attributing a direct quote to her without providing clear evidence of her endorsement of lowering the age of consent.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ginsburg explicitly advocated for lowering the age of consent to 12 years old. The evidence provided only suggests her involvement in a report discussing the need for sex-neutral laws.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any information."}
