{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the parking garage featured in the video is under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Public Safety, not the Austin Police Department.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific details about the connection between the broken windows and the vote to cut funding from the police department.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the broken windows in the parking garage are directly linked to the vote to cut police funding, without providing sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the broken windows, as the Texas Department of Public Safety reported that the damage was caused by a bb or pellet air gun, and no arrests have been made yet.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the damage shown in the video was discovered by law enforcement five days before the city's vote on police funding, suggesting that the two events are not directly related.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the broken windows in the context of the vote to cut police funding, as it is unclear if the damage was targeted specifically at state agency vehicles or if it was a random act of vandalism."}
