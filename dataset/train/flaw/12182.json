{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that using IBM technology could \"pay for\" health care reform, implying that it would completely cover the cost. However, the expert's analysis does not provide enough evidence to support this exaggerated claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's analysis mentions that Newt Gingrich heard about the claim from someone he trusts, but there is no further evidence or specific details provided to support the claim that an IBM leader told Obama about using IBM technology to cut fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that using IBM technology to stop paying fraudsters would be sufficient to cover the cost of health care reform. However, this assumption may not take into account other factors and expenses involved in health care reform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis raises questions about the validity of the claim by highlighting the lack of evidence and the general nature of the White House visits by IBM's CEO. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the purpose of these visits and the discussions that took place."}
