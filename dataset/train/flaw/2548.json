{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Mark Harris worked to stop Trump from being president, as there is no concrete evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that Mark Harris actively worked to stop Trump from being president.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mark Harris's support for Ted Cruz and his concerns about Trump prior to his nomination translate to actively working to stop Trump from being president, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Mark Harris's support for Ted Cruz and concerns about Trump were not necessarily aimed at stopping Trump from becoming president, but rather a strategic approach to secure their preferred nominee and defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election."}
