{"Contradict fact": "The claim that there was an earthquake in Shanghai in January 2021 contradicts the fact that there were no reported earthquakes in Shanghai during that month, as confirmed by various sources including the China Earthquake Administration and earthquake tracking websites.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the earthquake by stating that it was a 6.4 magnitude earthquake with more than 700 casualties. This is not supported by any factual evidence or official reports.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to prove the occurrence of the earthquake in Shanghai in January 2021. The expert's investigation using Google searches, earthquake tracking websites, and the China Earthquake Administration's records found no evidence of such an earthquake.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video footage provided is genuine and accurately depicts an earthquake in Shanghai. However, the expert's investigation using digital verification tools and reverse image searches found that the video contained images from different disasters in China and elsewhere, including a picture from the 2017 Sichuan earthquake.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for the video footage is that it is a compilation of images from different disasters, rather than a genuine recording of an earthquake in Shanghai in January 2021.
