{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of black children killed by abortion by stating that it is as high as 1,000 per day.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that abortion is the leading cause of death for black Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all abortions would have resulted in live births if not for the procedure, which is a problematic assumption as miscarriages and stillbirths are natural risks of pregnancy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim is contradicted by data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows that heart disease is the leading cause of death for black Americans, not abortion."}
