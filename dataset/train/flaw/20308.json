{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the highway by stating that China has \"opened\" an 880-kilometer highway to Pakistan, implying that it is a recent development. However, the highway mentioned in the claim, Ya'an-Xichang Expressway, has been open since April 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows the opening of a highway. While the video does show roads built on steep mountain slopes, across valleys, and over rivers, it does not explicitly demonstrate the opening of the mentioned highway.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video footage is related to the opening of the 880-kilometer highway to Pakistan. However, the video does not provide any clear connection to this specific highway.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, as the video footage is actually from the Ya'an-Xichang Expressway in Sichuan, China, and not directly linked to the China-Pakistan highway.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video footage is from the Ya'an-Xichang Expressway in Sichuan, China, and not the China-Pakistan highway as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in the provided claim."}
