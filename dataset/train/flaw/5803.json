{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of job growth in other states under the Republican governor by stating that \"most\" of Wisconsin's job growth occurred in other states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that \"18,000 of them were from the governors of other states.\" The evidence provided does not directly support this specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that job growth in other states is solely attributed to the actions of other governors, without considering other factors that may contribute to job growth in those states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Wisconsin residents got jobs in other states, such as personal choices or economic factors beyond the control of the governor. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
