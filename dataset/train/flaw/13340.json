{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in overall expenditures indicates an increase in funding from the county, without considering other sources of funding such as state contributions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility that school budgets grew even while local contributions remained flat, as suggested by the information provided about overall budgets and state funding.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the funding situation, as it only focuses on the county government's perspective and does not consider other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lack of funding increase, such as changes in enrollment or budget priorities, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the county has allocated the same amount of property-tax dollars to the county's schools every year since the 2008 fiscal year, which suggests a consistent level of funding."}
