{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of James Clapper's statement by stating that he definitively said there was no collusion, when in fact his statement was more nuanced.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that James Clapper's statement was not as definitive as Trump portrayed it to be, as Clapper later contradicted Trump's claim in a TV interview.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that \"virtually everyone else\" with knowledge of the investigation said there was no collusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that James Clapper's statement represents the views of all officials with knowledge of the investigation, which is not necessarily true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the fact that some officials with knowledge of the investigation have declined to say there is no evidence of collusion, citing ongoing investigations."}
