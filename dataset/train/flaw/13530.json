{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or proof provided to show that the video is indeed of opposition supporters smashing their TV sets after the poll verdict. The video is an old one from 2015 and cannot be representative of an event that took place in 2019.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video is not related to the Lok Sabha election result or opposition supporters. It has been previously shared with false narratives about Pakistanis breaking their TV sets after a cricket match and with a caption about a Pakistani breaking the TV when he saw a leader from Yemen.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not representative of the event it is being associated with. It is an old video that has been circulating on the internet for at least four years.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by suggesting that it shows opposition supporters smashing their TV sets in frustration over the election result. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a misleading video and false narratives to create a narrative about opposition supporters' frustration. The video is not related to the event it is being associated with.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the video is related to the Lok Sabha election result and that it shows opposition supporters smashing their TV sets. This assumption is not supported by any evidence."}
