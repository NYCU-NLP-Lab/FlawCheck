{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a lack of scientific evidence or support for the claim that cream of tartar is an effective treatment for migraine headaches.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict states that the claim is perplexing because historically, cream of tartar has not been associated with efficacy against headaches, and some sources even suggest it could be a cause of migraines. This suggests that the assumption that cream of tartar can treat migraines is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the concept of cream of tartar as a headache remedy is difficult to pinpoint, and the most explicit formulation of the notion comes from a post that posits cream of tartar as a cure for \"MSG poisoning,\" which is a largely unsubstantiated medical malady. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the belief in MSG poisoning.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the potential dangers of ingesting extremely high quantities of cream of tartar, as it can result in life-threatening cases of hyperkalemia."}
