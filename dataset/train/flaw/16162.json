{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in suggesting that U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy ordered Postal Service carriers to \"slow the mail down\" specifically to help Trump win the 2020 presidential election. The expert's verdict mentions that there were rumors and viral claims, but it does not provide concrete evidence or direct statements from DeJoy regarding this specific intention.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that DeJoy ordered Postal Service carriers to slow down mail to help Trump win the election. The expert's verdict mentions rumors and viral claims, but it does not provide substantial evidence or direct statements from DeJoy confirming this allegation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that DeJoy's appointment as Postmaster General and his political affiliation automatically translate into him ordering mail carriers to slow down deliveries to benefit Trump. This assumption may be problematic as it lacks direct evidence or statements from DeJoy confirming this allegation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were concerns about a backlog of ballots affecting the election, but it does not explore alternative explanations for any delays or issues with mail delivery. It is possible that there could be other factors contributing to mail delays, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or operational challenges within the Postal Service."}
