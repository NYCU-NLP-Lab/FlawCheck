{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of investment in opportunity zones, stating that $100 billion has been invested, while other estimates suggest a much lower figure of around $25-30 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that $100 billion has been invested in opportunity zones. The Trump administration and campaign have not provided any evidence to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the investment in opportunity zones is a result of the federal program and does not consider other sources of investment or alternative explanations for the economic growth in these neighborhoods."}
