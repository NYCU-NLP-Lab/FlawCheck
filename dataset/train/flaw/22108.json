{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that the photograph shows an African child on display in a \"human zoo\" at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium. The expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that the exhibition was not advertised or billed as a \"human zoo\" and the Congolese people were not confined or forced to participate against their will.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by using the term \"human zoo\" to describe the exhibition, while the expert's verdict explains that the term is mostly used by critics to highlight the inhumanity and racism of such displays.", "Understate": "There doesn't seem to be any evidence of understating in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not seem to falter at times as it presents a specific statement about the photograph. The expert's verdict, however, may be seen as faltering at times as it provides additional information and context about the exhibition.", "Lack enough support": "The claim and expert's verdict both provide information and context about the photograph and the exhibition, so there doesn't seem to be a lack of support in this case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim does not make any problematic assumptions. The expert's verdict, however, implies that the term \"human zoo\" is mostly used by critics to point out inhumanity and racism, which could be seen as an assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations, but the expert's verdict provides additional information and context about the exhibition, which could be seen as an alternative explanation to the claim."}
