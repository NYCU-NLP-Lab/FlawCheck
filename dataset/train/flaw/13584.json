{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the requirement of an ID to buy a beer, as it implies that it is a universal requirement when it is not.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that an ID is needed to buy a beer in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the requirement of an ID to vote is equivalent to the requirement of an ID to buy a beer, which may not be a valid comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why someone might be asked for an ID when buying a beer, such as age verification or store policies, rather than it being a legal requirement."}
