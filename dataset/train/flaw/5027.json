{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s. The provided evidence only mentions that Texas ranked first among 14 states in 2016, but there is no comparison to other states or concrete data on the number of animal deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s. The evidence provided only includes anecdotal information from a letter to the editor and a chart from an undated humane society data sheet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of sodium cyanide M-44s is solely responsible for animal deaths in Texas, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations for the deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for animal deaths in Texas, such as natural causes, other methods of predator control, or the presence of other harmful substances in the environment.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential benefits or effectiveness of sodium cyanide M-44s as a wildlife damage management tool. The provided evidence includes a statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture calling it \"an effective and environmentally sound\" tool.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on anecdotal evidence and general statements without providing specific data or comprehensive research on the topic."}
