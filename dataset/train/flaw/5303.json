However, the expert notes that pounds of food distributed may not be the best measure of need in a food bank's region.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in food delivery, such as changes in population, economic conditions, or other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of the factors contributing to the increase in food delivery.
