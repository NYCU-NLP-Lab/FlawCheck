{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to validate the correlation between the position of a statue's horse legs and the cause of a person's death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct relationship between the position of a statue's horse legs and the cause of a person's death, without considering other possible factors or variables.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis of specific statues disproves the claim by providing counterexamples where the position of the horse legs does not align with the cause of death.", "Understate": "The claim simplifies the cause of death into three categories (battle, wounds, natural causes), potentially understating the complexity and variety of causes of death.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the position of a statue's horse legs by attributing specific causes of death to each position, without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the position of a statue's horse legs may not be related to the cause of death, and alternative explanations, such as artistic choices or historical context, could be considered."}
