{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Molinaro's support for putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Molinaro voted against a bill to prohibit the use of shackles and restraints on pregnant inmates in labor, which suggests a level of support for the practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully evaluate the extent of Molinaro's support for putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth. The expert's verdict provides limited information on Molinaro's stance and does not offer additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Molinaro's vote against the anti-shackling bill equates to supporting the use of shackles on female inmates during childbirth. However, it is possible that Molinaro had other reasons for voting against the bill, which may not necessarily indicate support for the practice.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Molinaro's vote against the anti-shackling bill. It is possible that Molinaro had concerns or reservations about specific provisions within the bill, rather than supporting the use of shackles on female inmates during childbirth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times but rather presents a specific statement about Molinaro's stance on putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth."}
