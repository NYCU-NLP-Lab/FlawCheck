{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money received by Andrew McCabe's wife for her campaign, stating it as $700,000 instead of the actual amount of nearly $675,000.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by suggesting that Andrew McCabe was \"in charge\" of the FBI's investigation of Clinton's emails at the time of the donations, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Hillary Clinton personally gave the donations to McCabe's wife or had any say in the contributions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the donations from McAuliffe's PAC and the Virginia Democratic Party were directly linked to Hillary Clinton, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the donations, such as McAuliffe's efforts to support multiple Democratic candidates in the state Senate race."}
