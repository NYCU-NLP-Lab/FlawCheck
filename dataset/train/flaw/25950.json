{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo shows women of the Red Cross arriving in Normandy on D-Day to help injured troops, when in reality, the photo was taken seven months after the allied invasion of Europe and in Southern France, not Normandy.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by suggesting that it is a hidden or unknown image that is not shown in textbooks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the photo shows women of the Red Cross arriving in Normandy on D-Day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the photo is from D-Day and depicts women arriving in Normandy, when in fact it is from a different date and location.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the photo, which is that it shows women with the Red Cross arriving in Southern France to provide help to injured troops, rather than in Normandy as claimed in the post."}
