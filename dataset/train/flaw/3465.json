{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the Indian flag being raised in a Pakistan protest rally by stating that it is a historic event (\"For 70 years we were teased by people waving the flag of Pakistan here. Yesterday, the Indian flag was waved in Karachi\").", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or context to support the statement that the Indian flag was raised in a protest rally in Pakistan. The only evidence provided is a viral photo and social media posts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the Indian flag in the protest rally, such as individuals carrying flags of different countries or groups showing solidarity with India for reasons unrelated to the protest itself."}
