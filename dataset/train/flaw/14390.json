{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Obama is \"flush with cash\" and is returning to Wall Street for even more money. This implies that Obama is receiving a large amount of money from Wall Street, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that Wall Street supports President Obama. It only mentions that Wall Street bankers and financial insiders donated $42 million to Obama's last campaign, but does not provide any further data or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Obama received donations from Wall Street in the past, he is still supported by Wall Street in the present. However, this assumption may not be valid as political donations can change over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Wall Street bankers and financial insiders donated to Obama's campaign. It assumes that their donations indicate support for Obama, but there could be other reasons for their contributions such as political strategy or personal connections."}
