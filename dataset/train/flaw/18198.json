{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children rushing across the southwest border due to fear of the wall. The expert states that while many children are coming across the border, it is not at the level claimed by the statement.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of children apprehended at the southwest border. The expert provides data showing that thousands of children from Central America have been apprehended in recent years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the children are rushing across the border solely because they fear the wall. The expert states that there are other factors motivating them to come to the United States, such as seeking refugee protection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of the wall will prevent children from coming and going as they have been for decades. The expert challenges this assumption by stating that significant numbers of children are not arriving at the border because they fear the wall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the children are primarily seeking refugee protection, in the form of asylum, rather than solely fearing the wall. This presents an alternative explanation for their arrival at the border."}
