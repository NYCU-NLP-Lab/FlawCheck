{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by attributing it to \"jihadists\" and suggesting that it was an intentional attack on the temple and the idol.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the incident was carried out by \"jihadists\" or that it was a deliberate act of destruction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident was motivated by religious extremism without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the incident, stating that it could have been an accident rather than an intentional act of destruction."}
