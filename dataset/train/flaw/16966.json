{"Exaggerate": "The claim of preventing the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites, and perhaps as many as 1,400 lives may be an exaggeration as it is based on a hypothetical scenario and cannot be known for certain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the specific number of lives saved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shelter-in-place order implemented by Gov. Tony Evers is solely responsible for preventing the deaths, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in deaths, such as improved healthcare infrastructure or natural fluctuations in the spread of the virus."}
