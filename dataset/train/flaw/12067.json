{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of severe vaccine reactions by stating that between 3,000 and 4,500 cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) every year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the stated numbers of severe vaccine reactions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all reported cases of severe vaccine reactions are directly caused by vaccines, which is not supported by the available data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the reported cases in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between vaccines and adverse events, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the reported reactions."}
