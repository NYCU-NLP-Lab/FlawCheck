{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the alleged cover-up by stating that \"thousands of giant human remains\" were destroyed, without providing sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Smithsonian Institution destroyed giant skeletons to preserve the mainstream narrative of evolution. The article cited in the claim is from a questionable source, and the existence of the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) is questionable as well.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Smithsonian Institution colluded with unspecified parties to suppress evidence of giants, without providing concrete evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the alleged destruction of giant skeletons, such as lack of evidence or misinterpretation of findings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the earliest technically classified documents in the United States only date back to World War I, while the alleged discovery of giant skeletons is stated to have occurred in the early 1900s. This contradiction raises doubts about the claim's credibility.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable information. The existence of the AIAA and the credibility of the sources cited are questionable."}
