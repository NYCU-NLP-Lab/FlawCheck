{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that every time Bono claps, a child in Africa dies. This is not a factual statement and is meant to be exaggerated for effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that someone from the audience actually told Bono to stop clapping.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bono clapping is directly causing the death of children in Africa, which is a problematic assumption without any factual basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the audience member's comment, such as misunderstanding or sarcasm, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bono is known for his humanitarian efforts and activism, which goes against the idea that he would make such a statement during a concert."}
