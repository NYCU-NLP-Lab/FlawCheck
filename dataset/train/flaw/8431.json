{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"Pelosi made millions in coronavirus insider trading\" is an exaggeration. The expert's verdict clarifies that Pelosi's husband made a paper gain of about $1.1 million, not a realized profit.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation of insider trading. The expert's verdict mentions that Pelosi's husband exercised options to buy Amazon stock that later increased in value, but it was nearly two weeks before House members were briefed about the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pelosi used confidential information gained from her position to make a killing in the stock market. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that in 2011, Pelosi's husband made a profitable stock transaction involving Visa. This suggests that the gains made by Pelosi's husband in the stock market may not be solely due to insider trading related to the coronavirus pandemic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pelosi's husband's stock gains were not realized profits but rather a paper gain.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misstating the timeline for the stock trades in question and overstates the investment gains. This suggests a lack of accuracy and reliability in the claim."}
