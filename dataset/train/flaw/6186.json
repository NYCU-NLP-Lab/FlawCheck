{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Marilyn Monroe in persuading the Mocambo night club to book Ella Fitzgerald. While Monroe did help in the process, the claim may overstate her influence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that black entertainers had performed at the Mocambo club prior to Ella Fitzgerald. This suggests that race may not have been the sole or primary reason for the initial refusal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Ella Fitzgerald was refused by the Mocambo solely due to her race. The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the initial hesitation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the refusal to book Ella Fitzgerald was solely based on her race. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the owner's hesitation may have been due to Fitzgerald not being considered glamorous enough for the club.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the owner's hesitation, such as Fitzgerald's perceived lack of glamour and the presence of other black singers who had performed at the Mocambo before her.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that black singers had performed at the Mocambo before Ella Fitzgerald, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
