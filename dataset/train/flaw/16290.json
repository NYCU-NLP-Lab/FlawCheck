{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Jeanne Shaheen was \"principally involved in a plot\" to harass conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election. This could be seen as an exaggeration, as it presents the accusation as a significant and intentional conspiracy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a story published by The Daily Caller, a conservative publication, but it does not provide substantial evidence or documentation to support the accusation. The expert's analysis mentions that the provided documents mainly consist of letters from Shaheen and other Democratic Senators requesting the IRS to investigate nonprofits involved in federal election activities, which may not directly support the claim of a plot to harass conservative groups.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Shaheen's involvement in requesting the IRS to investigate nonprofits is evidence of a plot to harass conservative groups. However, this assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative motivations or interpretations for the actions taken.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis mentions that Shaheen's request to investigate nonprofits was related to their involvement in federal election activities. This suggests an alternative explanation for her actions, which may not align with the claim's assertion of a plot to target conservative groups.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact-check published by the expert, which found that it was a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens \"for their political views.\" This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the claim or expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falters at times in terms of providing convincing evidence or logical reasoning to support the accusation against Jeanne Shaheen. However, this bias is not consistently present throughout the claim."}
