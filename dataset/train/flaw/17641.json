{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it implies that the CEO of Goldman Sachs explicitly stated that he would be fine with either Bush or Clinton as president, while there is no clear evidence of such a statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the CEO of Goldman Sachs expressed support for both Bush and Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CEO's supposed statement reflects the views of the entire company, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the CEO's alleged statement, such as political fluidity or a preference for centrist candidates who maintain the financial status quo.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a clear and definitive statement from the CEO of Goldman Sachs, as there is conflicting information and lack of public statements.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the CEO's support for Clinton, as there is evidence of his past contributions and fundraisers for her campaign."}
