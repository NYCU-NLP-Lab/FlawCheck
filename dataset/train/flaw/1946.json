{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of furniture, china, and art that the Clintons were forced to return from the White House. The expert's verdict states that the aggregate value of the objects in question was much less than $200,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the claim that the Clintons \"stole\" the items. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides detailed information and sources to support their statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Clintons were forced to return the items, implying wrongdoing on their part. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the Clintons voluntarily returned or paid for some gifts due to a dispute over their ownership.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Clintons were not found to have \"stolen\" any items, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the value of the objects returned by stating a specific amount of $200,000, while the expert's verdict mentions that the aggregate value of the objects was much less than that.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the return of the items, stating that there was a dispute over whether the gifts were given to the Clintons personally or to the U.S.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making unsupported statements and using strong language (\"stole\") without providing evidence. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides a more balanced and factual analysis."}
