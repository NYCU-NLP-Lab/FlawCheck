{"Understate": "The claim understates the scientific consensus on the genetic factors contributing to homosexuality by stating that \"there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic.\" The expert's verdict mentions that if the claim had used the term \"biological\" instead of \"genetic,\" it would have been incorrect. This suggests that there is a scientific consensus that biological factors, including genetics, play a role in sexual orientation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statement that there is no scientific conclusion on the genetic basis of being gay. The expert's verdict does not provide any additional information or references to scientific studies or experts in the field.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being gay is solely determined by genetic factors and disregards other potential biological or environmental influences. The expert's verdict does not address this assumption directly but mentions that using the term \"genetic\" instead of \"biological\" is pivotal for rating the accuracy of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origins of homosexuality, such as non-genetic biological factors or environmental influences. The expert's verdict does not discuss alternative explanations either.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the scientific consensus that there is a genetic component to sexual orientation. The expert's verdict suggests that the claim would have been incorrect if it had used the term \"biological\" instead of \"genetic.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any specific aspect related to the genetic basis of being gay. The expert's verdict does not mention any exaggeration in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter or show inconsistency in its statement regarding the genetic basis of being gay. The expert's verdict does not mention any inconsistency in the claim either."}
