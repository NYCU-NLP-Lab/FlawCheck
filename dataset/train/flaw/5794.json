There is no specific evidence provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting a woman's right to choose without restrictions automatically means supporting late-term and partial-birth abortion, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Cory Booker's stance on abortion, such as his support for a woman's right to choose while still advocating for safety regulations."}
