{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which paid family leave is standard in all but five nations around the world. The expert's verdict mentions that there are only 188 countries for which policies were confirmed, not the claimed \"all but five nations.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that paid family leave is standard in all but five nations around the world. The sources provided by the spokesperson for Family Forward Oregon are not mentioned or evaluated in detail in the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of paid family leave in the United States is solely due to the country being out of step with developed nations. The expert's verdict mentions that private companies and states can set their own policies, and some states in the US already require paid leave for new moms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of paid family leave in the United States, such as different cultural, economic, or political factors that may influence policy decisions. The expert's verdict does not explore or discuss any alternative explanations either.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are countries other than the United States that do not guarantee mothers paid leave from work to care for their infants. The expert's verdict mentions that Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and four small Pacific islands also do not guarantee paid leave for mothers.", "Understate": "It is not clear if the claim is understating any information or downplaying the significance of paid family leave in other countries. The expert's verdict does not provide evidence of understatement in this case.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the global landscape of paid family leave policies. The expert's verdict mentions that they found it hard to believe that developing nations could offer a work-related benefit that the United States does not, indicating some skepticism or doubt about the claim."}
