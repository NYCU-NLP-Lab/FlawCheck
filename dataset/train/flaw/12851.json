{"Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the issue by making it sound as if McConnell voted three times to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing specifically, when in fact the legislation sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions that did not pertain to outsourcing specifically.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided by the Grimes campaign is not sufficient to prove that McConnell voted for tax breaks that specifically send Kentucky jobs overseas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McConnell's votes on the legislation were in favor of corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas, without considering the broader context and intent of the bills.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for McConnell's votes, as both laws would have given a tax benefit to companies that insource jobs and denied an already-existing tax break to companies that outsource them. This suggests that McConnell's votes were not solely in favor of outsourcing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no special provision in current law that gives corporations a deduction or any kind of tax break for moving employees out of the country.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates McConnell's role in hindering Kentucky's prosperity by attributing the outsourcing of jobs solely to his votes for corporate tax breaks."}
