{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of jobs lost to Mexico and China due to Kasich's trade deals. The expert's verdict suggests that the numbers provided are estimates based on \"displaced production\" and not on actual job losses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to back up the specific numbers mentioned (49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 jobs to China). The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers are estimates derived from studies that do not directly attribute changes in employment levels to the trade deals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kasich's trade deals were the sole cause of job losses in Ohio. The expert's verdict mentions that factors other than NAFTA and trade relations with China may have contributed to the widening trade deficit and changes in employment levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the job losses, such as imports from other countries displacing production in the US. The claim may not consider these alternative explanations and instead attributes all job losses to Kasich's trade deals."}
