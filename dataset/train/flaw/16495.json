{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the statement made by Albany Mayor Kathy M. Sheehan without providing additional evidence or sources to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that being in the country without documentation is not a crime, which is a problematic assumption as it contradicts the existence of immigration laws and regulations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as it is mentioned that federal authorities can deport undocumented immigrants, indicating that there are consequences for being in the country without documentation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that immigration violations can be considered civil violations and not necessarily crimes, as explained by legal experts and the Supreme Court case cited. However, it does not mean that being in the country without documentation is not a violation of immigration laws.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences of being in the country without documentation by only mentioning deportation as a penalty, while there may be other legal implications or penalties involved.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the legal framework surrounding immigration violations and the potential consequences."}
