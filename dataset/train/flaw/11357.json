{"Understate": "The claim understates the involvement of the University of Missouri in academic fraud by stating that they have been \"cleared of involvement.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that suggests otherwise, indicating that the university did have some level of involvement in the violations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the University of Missouri has been completely cleared of involvement in academic fraud, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict highlights that the university was indeed implicated in the violations, even if it was not intentional conduct.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the University of Missouri has been cleared of involvement in academic fraud. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim and questions its validity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation to the claim by suggesting that the university was not without fault and that their involvement in the violations cannot be completely dismissed. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of being cleared of involvement."}
