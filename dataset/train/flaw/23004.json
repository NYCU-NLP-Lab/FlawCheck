{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Sen. Steve Daines gave tax breaks to big drug companies, as the tax legislation did not specifically benefit drug makers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Sen. Daines voted for tax breaks specifically tailored to big drug companies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sen. Daines' vote for tax breaks indirectly benefited big drug companies, without providing concrete evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the tax breaks benefiting big drug companies, as the drop in the overall corporate tax rate and the treatment of repatriated overseas profits also played a role.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sen. Daines has voted for bills that seek to reduce prescription drug prices, suggesting that he solely supported big drug companies.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the tax breaks on big drug companies, as it only mentions billions of dollars in tax breaks without providing a comprehensive analysis of the overall financial benefit."}
