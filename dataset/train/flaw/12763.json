{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of ethanol on gas prices by stating that it reduced prices by 89 cents per gallon in 2010. This may be an overstatement of the actual effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that if ethanol disappeared, gas prices could rise by as much as 92 percent. It relies on a study by two economists but does not provide additional supporting evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence or absence of ethanol has a direct and significant impact on gas prices. This assumption may be oversimplified and not take into account other factors that influence gas prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for changes in gas prices, such as fluctuations in global oil prices or other market factors. It presents ethanol as the sole determinant of gas prices, which may not be accurate."}
