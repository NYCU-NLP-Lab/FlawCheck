The evidence provided in the expert's verdict does not directly support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo depicts an actual arrest of a Hong Kong resident by Taiwan police, without providing substantial evidence to back up this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the photo, such as it being a police training exercise or a staged scene, which the claim does not consider or address."}
