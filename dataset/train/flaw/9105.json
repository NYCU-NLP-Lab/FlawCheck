{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that Sen. Mary Landrieu received from BP over the last decade. The actual amount is $28,200, not $1.8 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only relies on statements made by Ed Schultz, a liberal host, without providing any concrete evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the campaign contributions from BP to Sen. Landrieu directly influence her actions and decisions regarding the oil industry. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks other factors that may influence her stance on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the campaign contributions received by Sen. Landrieu from BP, such as her representing a state heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry, rather than implying a direct influence on her actions."}
