{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money being spent on behalf of Jon Ossoff by stating that \"liberal megadonors\" are backing him with \"untold millions in dark money,\" while displaying an image with the words \"$1 billion in political spending.\" The actual estimate is that $1 billion may be spent on all candidates in both Georgia Senate elections for the entire 2020 campaign cycle.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that slightly more dark money has been spent on behalf of Jon Ossoff's opponent, Republican Sen. David Perdue, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that \"liberal megadonors\" are backing Jon Ossoff with \"untold millions in dark money.\" The evidence provided in the MarketWatch article does not speculate that $1 billion might be spent solely on behalf of Ossoff.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that the $1 billion in political spending mentioned in the MarketWatch article is specifically for supporting Jon Ossoff. The article actually refers to the possibility of $1 billion being spent by both parties combined in Georgia for the two Senate runoff elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the $1 billion estimate mentioned in the MarketWatch article includes all spending to support both Democratic and Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in Georgia, across all stages of the process, and not just dark money.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
