{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a new method discovered by Russian scientists to turn black skin white instantly. The article mentions that there is no report from Moscow Times or any other credible source that matches the claims made in the claim. Additionally, a Google search for the chemicals mentioned in the claim only returns results related to this specific claim, indicating a lack of supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph provided depicts the new method discovered by Russian scientists. However, the expert's verdict states that the photograph has been widely circulated online since 2012 and was originally posted as evidence of a sunburn, not as evidence of a scientific discovery. Therefore, the claim makes a problematic assumption about the photograph's relevance to the new method.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the photograph has a far likelier explanation as a warning about the dangers of falling asleep at the beach. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that the photograph depicts the new method discovered by Russian scientists."}
