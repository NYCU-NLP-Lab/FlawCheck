{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the presence of maggots in the jar of Bertolli tomato sauce. The only evidence provided is a Facebook post and a video, which may not be reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the maggots found in the jar were introduced during the manufacturing process or due to a compromised seal. However, this assumption is not backed by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the maggots could have been introduced to the jar after manufacturing, either at the store or in a home environment. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the maggots were present in the jar from the beginning.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that it is scientifically unlikely for maggots to survive the canning process and live in a sealed jar. This contradicts the claim that the maggots were found inside a new jar of sauce.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict is not consistent in its assessment of the claim. While it provides some evidence to challenge the claim, it also acknowledges that it is impossible to determine if the seal was broken before or after purchase.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the potential health risks or concerns associated with finding maggots in food products. It does not thoroughly address the potential implications for food safety."}
