{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the statement made by the FBI director by implying that there is absolutely no information or contact with Syrian refugees or the Syrian government, when in reality, there is a vetting process in place involving multiple agencies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of information or contact with the Syrian government or people on the ground means that it is impossible to determine the intentions of Syrian refugees. This assumption overlooks the extensive vetting process and security checks that are conducted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that there is no information or contact with Syrian refugees or the Syrian government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the FBI director's statement, such as the limitations of intelligence databases and the challenges of gathering comprehensive information on individuals from war-torn regions like Syria."}
