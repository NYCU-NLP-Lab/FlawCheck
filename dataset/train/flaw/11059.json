{"Contradict fact": "The claim that loan defaulters are being arrested in Kenya is contradicted by the evidence that the photos used in the post are from different crime scenes and unrelated to loan defaulting.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that 12 people have been arrested for failing to pay loans, when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the photos used in the post are unrelated to loan defaulting and do not provide evidence of arrests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos in the post are related to loan defaulting, which is a problematic assumption as they are from different crime scenes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for the photos is that they are from unrelated criminal cases, such as baby stealing and anti-terrorism operations, rather than arrests for loan defaulting."}
