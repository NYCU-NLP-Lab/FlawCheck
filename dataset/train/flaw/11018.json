{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that the Obama administration \"will no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),\" while the expert's verdict clarifies that the administration will continue to enforce it until it is repealed or struck down definitively by the courts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific sources to back up the statement that the Obama administration will no longer enforce DOMA.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration's announcement that they would not defend DOMA in court means they will no longer enforce it, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the Obama administration will continue to enforce DOMA until it is repealed or struck down by the courts."}
