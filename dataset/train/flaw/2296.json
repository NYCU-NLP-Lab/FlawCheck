{"Understate": "The claim may be underestimating the percentage of individuals arrested for crimes that do not result in a criminal conviction. The expert's verdict states that over 95 percent of them do not result in a conviction, but the data provided shows that only 4.8 percent resulted in a criminal conviction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison.\" The data provided in the expert's verdict shows that 2.4 percent of the cases resolved resulted in a state prison sentence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that treating 16- and 17-year-old defendants as children in Family Court would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders. This assumption is not supported by evidence or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low percentage of criminal convictions and state prison sentences for 16- and 17-year-old defendants. It does not explore other factors that may contribute to these outcomes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New York is one of two states that can prosecute 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal courts. The expert's verdict provides this information as a context for the claim."}
