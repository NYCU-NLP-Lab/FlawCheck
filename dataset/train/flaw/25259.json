{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the nature of the executive order by stating that President Trump has already signed it, when in fact, it was only a leaked draft at the time.", "Understate": "The claim understates the existing laws that already make undocumented immigrants ineligible for public benefits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that President Trump has signed an executive order barring undocumented people from receiving welfare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that undocumented immigrants are collecting welfare, without providing evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the leaked draft, such as it being a proposal or a discussion document rather than a fully-fledged signed order."}
