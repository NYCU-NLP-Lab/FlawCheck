{"Contradict fact": "The claim that \"Four kids who took the coronavirus vaccine died immediately\" contradicts the fact that there is no evidence that children have died because of a COVID-19 vaccine.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that four kids died immediately after taking the vaccine, without providing any evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided to substantiate the claim that four kids died immediately after taking the vaccine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the COVID-19 vaccine, which is still in development, will be mandatory for going back to school and will contain RFID chips. These assumptions are not supported by any evidence or official statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations and fails to consider that the deaths of the mentioned kids could be due to other factors unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making misleading and speculative statements about the COVID-19 vaccine without providing any credible evidence or sources to support its claims."}
