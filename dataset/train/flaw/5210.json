This assumption may not be universally applicable and could overlook specific circumstances or modus operandi.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert does not consider alternative explanations for the concerns raised by skeptical social media users. They focus solely on the implausibility of the scenario and do not explore other possibilities that could explain the fears or suspicions.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not contradict any factual information provided in the claim."}
