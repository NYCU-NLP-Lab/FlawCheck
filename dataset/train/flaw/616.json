{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the risk of thieves targeting homes based on discarded boxes after Christmas, as there is zero evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the notion that thieves select homes to break into based on curbed boxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that thieves actively monitor curbed boxes as a method of selecting homes to break into, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that burglars and thieves are opportunistic and do not need any particular inspiration to commit crimes, implying that there could be alternative explanations for home break-ins after Christmas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no substantiated evidence to support the idea that curbed boxes attract thieves or increase the risk of robbery.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual risk of being robbed during the holidays, as the expert mentions that holiday-related crimes do occur but may not be directly linked to curbed boxes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the risk of being robbed while driving trash to a recycling plant as potentially higher than the risk associated with discarded boxes, without providing concrete evidence or statistics to support this comparison."}
