{"Lack enough support": "The claim \"I've been here almost every day\" lacks enough support as it is not backed up by a comprehensive schedule or evidence of the individual's presence on specific days.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being present \"almost every day\" is sufficient to address the concerns raised by Martha Raddatz and the public.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim as the individual's presence at a church event in a different locality does not directly address the question of why they didn't come to the scene of the unrest for five days.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were no tweets or releases about Ferguson on August 10, which suggests that the individual may not have been present or actively engaged with the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the individual's actual presence and involvement by only mentioning a few specific appearances and events.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and consistent account of the individual's presence and actions during the specified period.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
