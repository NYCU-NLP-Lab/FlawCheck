{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which President-elect Joe Biden and the Georgia U.S. Senate candidates misled the public. While they did promise \"$2,000 checks,\" it is acknowledged that Biden's plan included $1,400 checks, which would fulfill the campaign promise of $2,000 per person COVID-19 stimulus payments.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully acknowledging the context in which the promises were made. It fails to mention that the promises were made in the context of legislation blocked by the Senate in late December, which aimed to raise the per person payment from $600 to $2,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the accusation that President-elect Joe Biden and the Georgia U.S. Senate candidates misled the public. The provided information only presents their promises and the subsequent unveiling of Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus plan, which included $1,400 checks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the promise of \"$2,000 checks\" meant an immediate passage of such payments. It fails to acknowledge that the promise was contingent on winning the Georgia Senate races and achieving a Democratic-controlled Senate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists regarding the promises made by President-elect Joe Biden and the Georgia U.S. Senate candidates. It is stated that the promises were made in the context of legislation blocked by the Senate and that the addition of $1,400 to the already distributed $600 checks would fulfill the campaign promise of $2,000 per person COVID-19 stimulus payments."}
