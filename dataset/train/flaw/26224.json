{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Joe Biden's accomplishments by falsely stating that he was a war hero, won the Medal of Honor, was a Rhodes Scholar, graduated top of his class at Harvard Law School, built a multi-million dollar law firm in Boston, and was instrumental in creating NASA, the Peace Corps, and the Department of Homeland Security.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden never served in the US military, received multiple draft deferments, and did not win the Medal of Honor. It also contradicts the fact that he was not a Rhodes Scholar, did not graduate top of his class at Harvard Law School, and did not build a multi-million dollar law firm in Boston.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation to support the false claims made about Joe Biden's accomplishments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the Facebook fact-checkers would flag false and misleading information about Joe Biden's accomplishments, similar to how they allegedly flagged actual accomplishments of Donald Trump.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the false information presented."}
