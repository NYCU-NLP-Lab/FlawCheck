However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the police department is actually investigating the incident and does not endorse or support the sticker.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate its assertion that Victoria Police promotes the anti-Daniel Andrews sticker. The expert's verdict states that the sticker was placed on the vehicle without authorization and that the police department is actively investigating the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the anti-Daniel Andrews sticker on the police car. The expert's verdict suggests that the sticker was placed on the vehicle by an unknown person, which could indicate an act of vandalism or personal expression rather than an official endorsement by Victoria Police."}
