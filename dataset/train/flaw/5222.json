{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Trump's actions by stating that he signed a bill returning prayer in schools, when in reality, he issued guidance on school prayer similar to previous administrations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that President Trump signed a bill returning prayer in schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that prayer in schools was previously banned and that President Trump's actions have changed the status quo. However, government-sponsored prayer in public schools has been unconstitutional for decades, and President Trump's guidance does not change this.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that prayer in schools was not banned before President Trump's announcement, and therefore, it is not possible for him to have returned prayer to schools.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of President Trump's guidance by referring to it as a \"bill\" when it is actually constitutional guidance issued by the U.S. Education Department.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for President Trump's announcement and guidance on school prayer is that it may be a mechanism to support more aggressive intervention into state and local educational policies/practices and to advertise to Christian communities that the administration will advocate for them."}
