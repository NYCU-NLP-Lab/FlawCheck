{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of H.R. 1 by stating that it would allow the Boston bomber to have a right to vote, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that H.R. 1 would grant voting rights to the Boston bomber.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that H.R. 1, if enacted, would not restore voting rights to felons serving life sentences, such as the Boston bomber.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that H.R. 1 would have an effect on the voting rights of the Boston bomber, which is not supported by the actual text and provisions of the bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation by falsely attributing the provision to H.R. 1, when in reality, the voting rights of felons are already restored in some states upon their release from incarceration."}
