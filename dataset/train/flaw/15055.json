{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows Senator Leila De Lima attending a party in 2020. The video is from 2015, and there is no additional evidence presented to prove that it is from 2020.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is recent and shows Senator De Lima attending a party in 2020. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence and is based on a misleading caption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from 2015, as confirmed by keyword searches and comparison with a longer video published by ABS-CBN in 2015.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it shows Senator De Lima singing during her birthday celebration and not attending a party with Herbert Colanggo, as falsely claimed in the caption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information about the video and its context, as it misrepresents the date and purpose of the footage.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by presenting it as evidence of Senator De Lima attending a party in 2020, while it is a recording from 2015.", "Understate": "No significant understatement bias is observed in the claim."}
