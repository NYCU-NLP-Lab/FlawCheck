{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Trump's statement by stating that he said \"all Mexicans are rapists.\" The expert's verdict mentions that Trump said that some unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border are hardened criminals and rapists, but it does not provide evidence that he said \"all Mexicans are rapists.\"", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Clinton-Kaine campaign cited 16 instances since June 2015 when Trump said that some unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border are hardened criminals and rapists. However, it does not provide specific evidence or examples to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump said \"all Mexicans are rapists,\" which is a problematic assumption as it may not accurately represent his statement. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump made controversial statements about Mexican immigration, but it does not provide clear evidence that he explicitly made the claim that all Mexicans are rapists.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that experts say unauthorized Latino immigrants usually come to the U.S. looking for jobs and to reunite with families that are already there. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the presence of unauthorized immigrants, rather than solely attributing it to criminal activity."}
