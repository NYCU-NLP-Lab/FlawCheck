{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of college grads who indicated Judge Judy was a Supreme Court justice. The actual survey found that only one in ten respondents selected \"Judith Sheindlin\" as one of nine Supreme Court justices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the respondents were aware that \"Judith Sheindlin\" and \"Judge Judy\" are the same person, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why respondents selected \"Judith Sheindlin\" as a Supreme Court justice, such as confusion or misunderstanding.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Judge Judy is not a Supreme Court justice.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading headline without further scrutiny or verification.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the level of ignorance or lack of knowledge among recent college graduates about American history and government, as suggested by the ACTA report."}
