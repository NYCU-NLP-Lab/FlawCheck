{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential requirement for affordable housing at the Wolf Point West development by stating that there was no requirement, when it is unclear if the zoning amendment in 2013 triggered such requirements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully validate the assertion that there was no requirement for affordable housing at the Wolf Point West development.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction cost of creating affordable housing in a 70-story building is three times more expensive, without providing concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the zoning amendment in 2013 could have triggered requirements for affordable housing, which could be an alternative explanation for the lack of affordable units in the development."}
