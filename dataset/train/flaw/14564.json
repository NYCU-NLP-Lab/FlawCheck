{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Heidi Heitkamp has never been interested in regulatory relief until she became a candidate for the Senate and faced pressure from her opponent. However, the evidence provided suggests that Heitkamp has been working on banking issues and regulatory reform since she was elected in 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Heitkamp suddenly became interested in regulatory relief only after pressure from her opponent. The evidence provided contradicts this claim and shows that Heitkamp has been actively involved in banking issues for several years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Heitkamp has been working on banking issues and regulatory reform since 2012, as evidenced by her membership in the Senate Banking Committee and her cosponsorship of relevant bills.", "Understate": "The claim understates Heitkamp's involvement in regulatory relief efforts by suggesting that she has only shown a \"little bit\" of interest. The evidence provided indicates that she has been actively engaged in discussions, hearings, and cosponsorship of bills related to regulatory reform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that Heitkamp's interest in regulatory relief may not be solely driven by her candidacy for the Senate or pressure from her opponent. The evidence suggests that she has consistently expressed a desire for regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions throughout her tenure.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the evidence and context surrounding Heitkamp's involvement in regulatory relief efforts. It fails to acknowledge her previous work and implies a sudden change in her stance without sufficient justification."}
