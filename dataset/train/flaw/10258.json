{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that China will have twice the number of submarines as the US in just over a decade. The information provided is based on estimates and projections, rather than concrete data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that China's submarine fleet will continue to grow at a rapid pace, without considering potential factors that could hinder or slow down its expansion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in China's submarine fleet, such as modernization efforts or a shift in military strategy, which are not explored in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim potentially understates the projected size of the US submarine fleet, as it only considers general purpose boats and does not include ballistic missile submarines. The actual number of US submarines is projected to be higher than the figure provided.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that China's military numbers, including its submarine fleet, are not publicly disclosed, making it difficult to accurately quantify its size and growth.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the growth rate of China's submarine fleet by relying on estimates from a retired Navy captain who was later fired for making unauthorized statements. The credibility of these estimates is questionable.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive assessment of the projected growth of China's submarine fleet. The information provided is fragmented and relies on various sources and estimates, leading to uncertainty and inconsistency."}
