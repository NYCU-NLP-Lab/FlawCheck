{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that radio in Spain is broadcasting sacred healing verses in Sanskrit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence provided only mentions a video on Facebook and a YouTube channel owned by a Sanskrit singer, but does not establish a direct connection to radio broadcasts in Spain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the verses heard in the video are being broadcasted on radio in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is no explicit mention or evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance and impact of the alleged radio broadcasts by associating them with sacred healing verses and the Hindu religion. The evidence provided does not establish the effectiveness or relevance of these verses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question was published on a YouTube channel owned by a London-based Sanskrit singer and tutor, suggesting that the verses are not being broadcasted on radio in Spain as claimed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication provided to suggest that the claim is understating any aspect.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making assumptions without sufficient evidence and contradicting available facts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the video featuring the Sanskrit verses is not related to radio broadcasts in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather a recording made in a studio in London for the purpose of sharing pure vibrations and promoting peace of mind."}
