{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Sen. Durbin's history of misrepresenting what happens in White House meetings, as it only presents one instance from 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or examples to support the assertion that Sen. Durbin has a history of misrepresenting White House meetings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Sen. Durbin misquoted a GOP leader in 2013, he is also misrepresenting what happened in the current White House meeting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Sen. Durbin's actions, such as miscommunication or misunderstanding, rather than intentional misrepresentation."}
