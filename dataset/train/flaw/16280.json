{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that it is federal law, not state laws legalizing marijuana, that prohibits marijuana users from owning guns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that states have legalized marijuana use and subsequently banned marijuana users from owning guns as a \"back-door\" gun control measure, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that most states that have legalized marijuana use have subsequently banned marijuana users from owning guns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the federal ban on marijuana possession and firearms ownership existed before state efforts to legalize marijuana.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the circumstance, stating that gun buyers are required to disclose their marijuana use and licensed gun sellers are prohibited from selling firearms to individuals who admit to using cannabis."}
