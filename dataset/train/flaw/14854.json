{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Big Bird has \"cousins\" around the world who are orange, blue, green, and yellow. The provided evidence includes tweets and pictures, but it may not be comprehensive enough to establish the claim conclusively.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of different-colored Big Bird-like characters in various countries implies that they are Big Bird's \"cousins.\" However, this assumption may not be accurate or supported by factual information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of different-colored Big Bird-like characters in different countries. It is possible that these characters were created to cater to local audiences and may not necessarily be considered Big Bird's \"cousins\" in the show's storyline.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Big Bird is traditionally portrayed as a yellow-colored character. The existence of different-colored Big Bird-like characters challenges the established perception of Big Bird's appearance.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the different-colored Big Bird-like characters by referring to them as \"cousins.\" It is unclear if they are officially recognized as Big Bird's relatives within the show's narrative.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict provides information from various sources, including tweets and official statements, but there may be instances where the information or evidence presented falters or lacks reliability."}
