{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the crew of the USS Constitution consumed more than 250,000 gallons of liquor and no water at all during a six-month voyage in 1798 is likely an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the amount of liquor consumed and the absence of water during the voyage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crew could survive and function on such a high amount of alcohol without any water, which is unlikely and problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or variations of the story, as the details of the anecdote vary from teller to teller."}
