{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict suggests that Lt. Gov. Dan Forest exaggerated the potential risks associated with Gov. Cooper's proposed bill, specifically regarding the \"Look But Don't Touch\" policy in bathrooms.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Forest's claim was made before the bill was filed, and he based his statement on what Cooper said in a press conference. This suggests that Forest's claim may lack sufficient supporting evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "Forest's claim assumes that once HB2 is repealed, cities and counties will rush to pass transgender-friendly bathroom rules, leading to the \"Look But Don't Touch\" policy. This assumption is considered problematic by the expert.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are existing laws in place that can protect people from the acts described by Forest, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or solutions to the concerns raised."}
