{"Exaggerate": "The claim could be seen as exaggerating the issue by stating that India TV uses an image of PM Modi sweeping the floor. While it is true that India TV used a photoshopped image, it is important to note that this was not a deliberate action by the channel but rather a mistake or oversight.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used by India TV was not of PM Modi but a morphed image. This misrepresentation of facts is a significant bias.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing additional evidence or examples of India TV using incorrect information in its broadcasts. It only mentions one other incident from the previous year, which may not be sufficient to establish a pattern of behavior.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of the morphed image by India TV was intentional and malicious. While it is possible that there was negligence or lack of fact-checking, it is not explicitly stated in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for why India TV used the morphed image. It does not explore the possibility of a mistake or oversight on the part of the channel."}
