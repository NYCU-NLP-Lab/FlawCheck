{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the funding for K-12 education in Florida by stating it is the highest in history, when in fact, it is not.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the funding is the highest in Florida history.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding amount alone determines whether it is a \"record\" or not, without considering other factors such as per-pupil spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the increase in funding, such as inflation or changes in student population, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
