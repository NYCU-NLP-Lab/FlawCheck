{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the military is in charge of the country without definitive proof.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that the military is running the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden is an \"illegal president\" without providing any evidence or factual basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and evidence that contradict the claim, such as Biden winning the electoral votes and being duly sworn into office."}
