{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money being given to Iran, stating that \"billions of dollars\" are being given, when in reality it is expected to be closer to $50 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the money given to Iran will directly fund terrorists that are killing the US and its allies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Iran is the world's largest supporter of terrorism without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the money being given to Iran, which is that it is revenue from oil and gas sales that foreign banks are forced to hold.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the funds being given to Iran are not taxpayer money, but rather funds that were previously frozen under sanctions and are now being released with US permission."}
