{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of early ballots being rejected for missing signatures in Miami-Dade County. The actual percentage is less than 1%, not 23% as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion of a 23% rejection rate for missing signatures. The available data shows a rejection rate of less than 1%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 23% statistic is accurate without providing any reliable source or evidence to support it. It is based on a misinterpretation of an op-ed and a deleted tweet.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the 23% claim and the actual rejection rate. It fails to acknowledge that the 23% statistic is incorrect and misleading.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual rejection rate for missing signatures in Miami-Dade County is less than 1%, not 23% as stated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on inaccurate information and failing to provide accurate data or evidence to support the assertion of a 23% rejection rate.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
