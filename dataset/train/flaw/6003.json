{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that \"more than two-thirds\" of the aliens brought under the program weren't actually minors. This implies a high percentage and may be an exaggeration of the actual numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Central American Minors program was primarily intended for minors, but the expert's verdict mentions that it was created to bring children fleeing violence in Central America into the United States. This assumption may be problematic.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide specific data or evidence to support or refute the claim, so it may lack enough support to fully assess its accuracy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why more than two-thirds of the aliens brought under the program weren't minors. It may be possible that some individuals who were initially considered minors were later determined to be adults.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Central American Minors program was created to bring children fleeing violence in Central America into the United States, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. The claim suggests that the program largely benefits adults, which contradicts its intended purpose.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear definition of what constitutes a \"minor\" in the context of the Central American Minors program. The expert's verdict mentions that minors are considered applicants under 18, but it is unclear if this aligns with the claim's definition of minors.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or present a bias of understating the situation."}
