{"Exaggerate": "The claim includes adjectives like \"chilling,\" \"nauseating,\" \"stomach-churning,\" and \"sickening\" to describe the discovery made during the draining of Niagara Falls. While the bodies of two individuals were indeed found, the use of these adjectives may be considered an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that engineers made a \"grisly\" discovery. It only mentions the recovery of two dead bodies, but there is no further information or details provided about the nature of the discovery.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim assumes that the bodies found during the draining of Niagara Falls were a result of an engineering feat. However, there could be alternative explanations for the presence of the bodies, such as accidents or suicides unrelated to the engineering project.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the dewatering project by not emphasizing the scale and purpose of the project. It was a massive undertaking by the Army Corps of Engineers to assess erosion and study the face of the American Falls.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any established facts. The draining of Niagara Falls did occur in 1969, and two bodies were indeed recovered during the process.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at any specific point. It provides accurate information about the dewatering project and the recovery of bodies during that time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bodies found during the draining of Niagara Falls were a result of the engineering project. However, it does not provide concrete evidence or information to support this assumption."}
