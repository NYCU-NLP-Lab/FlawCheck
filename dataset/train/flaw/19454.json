{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the decline in Phoenix's murder rate was directly caused by dropping the sanctuary city policy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between dropping the sanctuary city policy and the decrease in the murder rate without considering other possible factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the decrease in the murder rate, such as changes in law enforcement strategies or other social factors, which are not explored or considered in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "Phoenix officials deny that the city ever had sanctuary policies, contradicting the claim that the murder rate dropped after abandoning such policies.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by attributing the decline in the murder rate solely to the sanctuary city policy change, without acknowledging other potential factors at play.", "Falters at times": "The claim's credibility falters due to conflicting statements from Phoenix officials and the lack of a clear consensus on whether Phoenix was considered a sanctuary city.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of dropping the sanctuary city policy by attributing a specific percentage decrease in the murder rate without providing sufficient evidence or context."}
