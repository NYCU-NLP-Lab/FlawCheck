{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the question about race has been asked by every census since the 1790 census is supported by the Census Bureau director's statement and the availability of historical records online. However, it is not clear if there is enough support to definitively conclude that this is true for every census.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that asking for an individual's race is the most private question on the census form. This assumption may be problematic as privacy concerns can vary among individuals, and other questions on the form may also be considered private by different people.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for why the question about race has been consistently asked in every census. It does not explore potential reasons or justifications for including this question.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the historical context and changes in the census questions related to race. It briefly mentions that the questions reflect changing attitudes and understandings about race but does not delve deeper into this aspect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. However, it is important to note that the claim's statement about the question on race being the most private may be subjective and not universally agreed upon.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or evidence related to the question about race on the census form.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not exaggerate any information or evidence related to the question about race on the census form."}
