{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of pot shops that would be in Florida if Amendment 2 passes, stating that there would be \"almost 2,000 pot shops\" which is more than Walmart and Walgreens combined.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there would be almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of pot shops would outnumber Walmart and Walgreens locations in Florida, without considering other factors such as population density or the potential regulations that could be put in place.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of pot shops in Florida, such as the discretion of the Legislature and the Florida Health Department in determining the regulations and number of dispensaries.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual number of Walmart and Walgreens locations in Florida, as the figures used in the claim are outdated and not accurate."}
