{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or corroboration to support the assertion that a taxi driver in Nigeria (or Zambia, or New York City) is using his cab to pick up victims. The information provided does not provide concrete proof or reliable sources to substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the unidentified man in the photograph is indeed a murderous taxi driver, without any conclusive evidence or verification.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that police officials in both New York City and Washington D.C. have stated that they have never heard of the post or any allegations about a \"murder cab.\" The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles also confirmed that the license plate mentioned in the claim does not match any registered taxi or vehicle.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by providing divergent information about the unidentified man's background and origin, with conflicting descriptions from different online sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article suggests that the Zambian Observer's claim about the man engaging in \"ritual killings\" could be an alternative explanation for the false rumor, indicating a different motive behind the dissemination of the claim.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the potential harm caused by spreading false information and hoaxes, as it highlights the dangers of sharing photographs online but does not fully address the broader consequences or impact of such actions.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim itself, but the fact that it has spread across multiple continents and countries suggests that it may have been exaggerated or sensationalized as it gained traction on social media."}
