{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the United States exporting more fuel products than it imported in 2011 by stating it as the first time since 1949.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the United States exported more gasoline, diesel, and other fuels than it imported in 2011.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that keeping fuel production and consumption within the United States would create downward pressures on gas and diesel prices and benefit families and the economy, without providing evidence or reasoning for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the increase in fuel exports, such as changes in global diesel consumption or specific factors driving exports to the Netherlands, Mexico, and Central and South America."}
