{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which President Barack Obama is trying to \"pack\" the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The expert's verdict mentions that Republican lawmakers have accused Obama of \"packing\" the court, but it does not provide concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence or examples to fully support the claim that President Obama is trying to \"pack\" the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It mentions Republican lawmakers accusing Obama of \"packing\" the court, but it does not provide any specific actions or evidence from Obama himself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's nomination of three judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is an attempt to \"pack\" the court. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence or information to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Republican lawmakers have accused Obama of \"packing\" the court, but it does not explore or provide alternative explanations for Obama's nomination of three judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. This leaves room for alternative interpretations or motives for Obama's actions."}
