{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by suggesting that if the Modi government comes back, Balochistan will be independent, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows the BJP flag being waved in Pakistan's Balochistan province.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is proof of the BJP flag being waved in Pakistan, without considering alternative explanations or possibilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the presence of the BJP flag in the video, such as the video being taken in an Indian-administered region like Jammu and Kashmir, rather than in Pakistan.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was originally posted by a BJP member in Indian-administered Kashmir, suggesting that it may not be related to Pakistan at all."}
