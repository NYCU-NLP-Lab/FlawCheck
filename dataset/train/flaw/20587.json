{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photograph shows Tulsi Gabbard with members of Antifa, when in reality it only shows her with one individual who supports Antifa.", "Understate": "The claim understates the context of the photograph by failing to mention that it was taken at the Standing Rock protests in December 2016, not at an Antifa event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the photograph depicts Tulsi Gabbard with members of Antifa, as it only shows her with one individual who supports Antifa.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that because Tulsi Gabbard is pictured with a supporter of Antifa, she herself is an \"antifa fascist fangirl,\" which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that it was taken at an environmental protest and has little or nothing to do with the Antifa movement."}
