{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the events surrounding the mass shooter by stating that a noose was hung on his locker and he was fired, which did not happen.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that the shooter returned to work and killed those he believed were involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mass shooter's actions were solely motivated by the alleged racial discrimination he experienced, without considering other possible factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the shooter had not been fired, as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the shooter's motivations and the ongoing tensions he had with his coworkers, reducing it to a single incident of racial discrimination."}
