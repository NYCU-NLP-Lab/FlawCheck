{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in stating that Kamala Harris \"lied\" about being in the second racially integrated class at Berkeley Public Schools. The evidence provided suggests that she may have been mistaken or misremembered the details, rather than intentionally lying.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it relies on a single article from a junk news and conspiracy site, Gateway Pundit, which may not be a credible source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Harris' statement about being part of the second class to integrate Berkeley public schools refers to lower grade-level schools, when in fact it may have been referring to Berkeley High School.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Harris may have been referring to her experience at Berkeley High School, which had a significant proportion of black students as early as 1963, rather than the lower grade-level schools.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Berkeley Public Schools didn't fully integrate until 1968, and Harris entered the school system in 1969."}
