{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single photograph and does not provide additional evidence or data to support the assertion that Dutch restaurants have solved the problem of dining out during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the installation of personal greenhouse booths in Dutch restaurants is a solution to the problem of dining out during the pandemic. However, it is not clear if these booths have been proven to effectively mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission or if they have been approved by government officials.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations and uncertainties surrounding the proposed dining solution. The expert's verdict mentions that the pods are not yet publicly available and the plan has not been approved by city officials, indicating that there are potential obstacles or challenges that may prevent its implementation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or solutions to the problem of dining out during the pandemic. It focuses solely on the installation of personal greenhouse booths without exploring other possible strategies or measures that restaurants could implement to ensure safety and social distancing.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting incomplete or untrue information. The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph was often shared on social media with incomplete or false information, suggesting that there may be inaccuracies or misrepresentations surrounding the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the pods are not yet publicly available as a dining option and have not been approved by city officials. This contradicts the assertion that Dutch restaurants have already solved the problem of dining out during the pandemic.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effectiveness or widespread implementation of the personal greenhouse booths. It presents the solution as if it has already been successfully implemented in Dutch restaurants, while the expert's verdict indicates that it is still a proposed solution and its availability is uncertain."}
