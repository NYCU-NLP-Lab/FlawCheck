{"Lack enough support": "The initial claim lacks enough support as it only mentions that actor Jay Johnston was photographed at the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, without providing any concrete evidence or sources to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person photographed at the Capitol riot is indeed Jay Johnston without providing definitive proof or confirmation at the time.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Johnston's name was not on the FBI's list of people arrested for their participation in the Capitol attack, which was updated on March 1.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of the arrest of Jay Johnston on June 7, 2023, as it only mentions it briefly without providing further details or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the photograph resembling Jay Johnston, such as mistaken identity or a look-alike, which are not explored or discussed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, such as the initial uncertainty about the person's identity in the photograph and later confirming it to be Jay Johnston.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it mainly focuses on the identification of Jay Johnston in the photograph and his subsequent arrest."}
