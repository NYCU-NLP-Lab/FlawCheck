{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that New Zealand's abortion laws allow for abortion \"up to birth for any reason.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that abortions after 20 weeks are only permitted in specific circumstances, taking into account factors such as the woman's physical and mental health, and it requires agreement from two qualified health practitioners.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the assumption that clinicians would be willing to perform an abortion without considering the clinical circumstances, including the woman's health, gestational stage, and ethical/professional standards. The expert's verdict highlights that this assumption is problematic and not reflective of the actual regulations and practices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that abortion is available \"up to birth for any reason.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Abortion Legislation Act (2020) and statements from experts to refute this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the restriction on disability-selective abortion was never really there in the first place. This contradicts the claim that the \"new regime\" allows disability-selective abortion up to birth.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the abortion laws in New Zealand. The expert's verdict points out the misleading nature of the claim and provides accurate information about the regulations and circumstances under which abortions are permitted."}
