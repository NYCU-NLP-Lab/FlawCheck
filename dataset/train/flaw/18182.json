{"Understate": "The claim understates the potential consequences of impeachment by only mentioning the loss of benefits such as a pension and security detail. It fails to mention that a president who is impeached, convicted, and removed from office may also be barred from holding future office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that a president loses benefits such as a pension and security detail if impeached, convicted, and removed from office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the claim does not consider, which is that a president who is impeached but not convicted and removed from office maintains the benefits outlined in the Former Presidents Act.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a president who is impeached but not convicted and removed from office still receives the benefits bestowed on former presidents, as exemplified by President Bill Clinton's case.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by stating that it is unclear if a president who is impeached, convicted, and removed from office would lose Secret Service protection."}
