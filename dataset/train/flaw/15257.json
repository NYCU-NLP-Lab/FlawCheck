{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the debt increased under President Barack Obama, stating it as 23 percent when the actual percentage increase was more than double that amount (61 percent).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the claim of a 23 percent increase in debt under President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a lower percentage increase in debt is inherently better, without considering other factors or context that may influence the debt levels.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the debt increase under President Obama was not the lowest compared to any president going back to Ronald Reagan, as there were presidents with lower debt increases such as George H.W. Bush (52 percent).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the debt increase, such as economic conditions, legislative actions, or external events."}
