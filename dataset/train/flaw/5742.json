{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of times President Trump mentioned WikiLeaks in speeches during the last month of the campaign. The expert's verdict indicates that the actual number is around 137, which is lower than the claim's figure of over 160.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the exact number of times President Trump mentioned WikiLeaks in speeches during the last month of the campaign. The expert's verdict mentions different sources and methods used to estimate the number, but there is no definitive evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that mentioning WikiLeaks multiple times in speeches indicates a strong endorsement or support by President Trump. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the administration's view towards WikiLeaks may have changed, as indicated by statements from CIA director Mike Pompeo and U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why President Trump mentioned WikiLeaks multiple times in speeches. The expert's verdict mentions that some of the mentions may have been in reference to the content of the leaked emails rather than explicit support for WikiLeaks as an organization.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Trump's CIA director, Mike Pompeo, had a different attitude towards WikiLeaks and addressed the anonymous hacking website in a tough speech. This contradicts the claim's implication that President Trump consistently praised WikiLeaks during the last month of the campaign.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the number of times President Trump mentioned WikiLeaks in speeches during the last month of the campaign. The expert's verdict indicates that the claim's figure of over 160 may be an overestimate.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
