{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific statistics or sources to support the statement that Jews are more often the victims of hate crimes than Muslims in the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hate crimes against Jews occur more frequently than against Muslims based solely on the raw number of reported incidents, without considering the population size or rate of hate crimes per capita.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the higher number of hate crimes against Jews could be attributed to lazy reporting or the fact that there are more Jews than Muslims in the United States.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the occurrence of hate crimes against Muslims by not considering the population size and rate of hate crimes per capita.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that hate crimes against Jews outnumber hate crimes against Muslims based on the FBI's reported incidents in 2014.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the prevalence of hate crimes against Jews by not considering the population size and rate of hate crimes per capita."}
