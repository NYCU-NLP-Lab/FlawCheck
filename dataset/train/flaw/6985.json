{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by stating that \"Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don't have access to broadband.\" The expert's verdict suggests that the figure is actually higher, with 61% of rural Missourians lacking access to broadband according to the FCC.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the statement that \"Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don't have access to broadband.\" It would benefit from providing more evidence or references to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of broadband access in rural Missouri is a problem that needs to be changed. While the expert's verdict mentions the importance of broadband access for various aspects of life, it doesn't explicitly state whether it is a problem or not.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for why nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. It could be useful to explore potential reasons or factors that contribute to this issue."}
