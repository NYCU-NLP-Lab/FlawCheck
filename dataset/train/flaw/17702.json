{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict states that they searched the text of \"End of Days\" and found nothing related to \"Wuhan\" or \"Wuhan-400\".", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the book \"End of Days\" predicted the current coronavirus outbreak based on a few underlined and circled sentences in a Facebook post, without considering other factors or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the reference to \"Wuhan-400\" actually comes from a different book, \"The Eyes of Darkness\" by Dean Koontz, suggesting an alternative explanation for the mention of Wuhan in the book \"End of Days\".", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the book \"End of Days\" was published in 2008, more than a decade before the new coronavirus outbreak was reported.", "Understate": "It can be argued that the claim understates the differences between the current coronavirus outbreak and the description in the book \"End of Days\" by not mentioning the differences highlighted by Snopes, such as the fatality rate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the underlined and circled sentences in the Facebook post by suggesting that they predict the current coronavirus outbreak, without considering the context or other information in the book."}
