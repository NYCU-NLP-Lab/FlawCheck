{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the owners of the caf\u00e9 made a decision to not serve police officers based on a specific incident involving a Latino police officer. However, there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the caf\u00e9 owners have a policy of not serving police officers. The only information provided is a statement from one of the owners and an Instagram post, which may not be enough to establish a consistent policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the caf\u00e9 owners' decision, such as concerns about the behavior or actions of some police officers, rather than a blanket refusal to serve all police officers. However, this alternative explanation is not explored or discussed in the provided information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing clear and consistent information. For example, the claim states that the caf\u00e9 owners said they would not be serving police officers, but later mentions that the caf\u00e9 staff advised the police officer that the establishment does not serve the police.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance or impact of the caf\u00e9 owners' decision by not providing any information on the public reaction or the consequences faced by the caf\u00e9 as a result of their policy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the caf\u00e9 owners made a statement on Instagram confirming their policy of asking police officers to leave for the safety of their customers and themselves. The claim implies that the decision was made in February 2018, but the Instagram post mentioned is from February 22, 2018.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim."}
