{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or verification to support the existence of a holy man disguising himself as homeless.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the story is true and portrays it as a factual event, despite the lack of evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no identified pastor named Jeremiah Steepek or any church headed by a pastor with that name.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the experiment conducted at Princeton University by presenting it as a direct inspiration for the story, despite the differences in context and purpose.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the real-life incidents in 2013, where pastors did engage in similar experiments, by not giving them enough emphasis or attention.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the behavior of the congregation towards the homeless man, such as lack of awareness or personal circumstances of the individuals involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a photograph unrelated to the narrative, which raises doubts about its reliability and accuracy."}
