{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation of medical price gouging under the current Pakistani government.

However, the expert points out that the photo has been digitally manipulated and the prices on the boxes do not reflect the actual pricing of the product.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the manufacturing date stamp on the boxes predates the current PTI administration, suggesting that the price gouging cannot be attributed to the current government.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the issue of medical price gouging by presenting manipulated information and misleadingly attributing it to the current government.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing accurate information and failing to consider alternative explanations for the pricing discrepancy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that the photo has been digitally manipulated and the prices on the boxes do not reflect the actual pricing of the product."}
