{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of citizens carrying guns on crime rates by stating that \"everywhere\" there are more citizens carrying guns, crime is less.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that states with open or concealed carry have seen a 25 percent decline in crime.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between increased gun ownership and decreased crime rates without providing clear evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts point out that there are alternative explanations for the decline in crime rates, such as other coinciding trends or factors that could contribute to the decrease.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of a peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Criminology that refutes the research conducted by John Lott, which the claim is based on.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable evidence to support its assertion, as it relies on research that is not published in a peer-reviewed journal and does not specifically address open carry."}
