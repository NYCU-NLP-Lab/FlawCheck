It only provides information about changes to Facebook's policy and statements from Facebook representatives.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ban on private gun sales without background checks is an effective measure to address the issue of firearms being sold on Facebook. It does not provide any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore any alternative explanations for Facebook's policy change, such as potential legal or regulatory pressures, public relations concerns, or other business motives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the rumor that Facebook was banning all pro-gun rights groups from using their platform, stating that the ban only applies to private gun sales without background checks."}
