{"Lack enough support": "The claim that PolitiFact said Obama \"kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules\" is supported by the fact that PolitiFact rated a specific promise as \"kept.\" However, the expert's verdict suggests that there are additional promise ratings that are relevant to the claim and may provide a more comprehensive assessment of Obama's record on ethics. Therefore, the claim may lack enough support to fully capture the complexity of the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict indicates that there are at least 10 additional promise ratings relevant to the claim, and Obama's record on those promises has been more mixed. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of Obama's actions and achievements regarding ethics rules. The claim does not acknowledge these alternative explanations, potentially leading to a biased or incomplete representation of the situation.", "Understate": "The claim states that PolitiFact said Obama \"kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules.\" However, the expert's verdict suggests that there are more promise ratings relevant to the claim, indicating that the claim may understate the complexity of Obama's record on ethics rules. The claim focuses on a single promise rating, while the broader context suggests a more nuanced evaluation is necessary.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the executive order, which was the basis for PolitiFact's \"Promise Kept\" rating, has not been checked subsequently to see if it has been adhered to. This suggests that the claim may falter at times in fully assessing the impact and effectiveness of Obama's actions on ethics rules. The claim presents a snapshot of a specific promise rating without considering the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the rules.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the single promise rating mentioned from PolitiFact is sufficient to support the assertion that Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules. However, the expert's verdict highlights the existence of additional promise ratings that provide a more mixed assessment of Obama's record. This indicates that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption that a single rating represents the entirety of Obama's efforts on ethics rules.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the impact or significance of Obama's actions on ethics rules. However, without further context or information, it is difficult to determine if there is any exaggeration present in the claim."}
