{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video has nothing to do with the June 2017 terrorist attack and shows a small group of far-right extremists counter-protesting an anti-racism rally.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the support for the US President by stating that it shows Londoners expressing support, while the video actually shows a small group of people chanting in support.", "Understate": "The claim understates the context of the video by not mentioning that it was filmed in March 2017 and does not represent the general sentiment of Londoners.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video without any additional evidence or context to support the assertion that Londoners were expressing support for the US President.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the video is related to the June 2017 terrorist attack, which is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the video shows a small group of far-right extremists counter-protesting an anti-racism rally, rather than expressing support for the US President."}
