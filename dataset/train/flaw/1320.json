{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the risks and dangers of the flu shot by stating that it is \"dangerous\" and \"full of risks\" without providing sufficient evidence to support these claims.", "Understate": "The claim understates the effectiveness of the flu shot by suggesting that it has a \"supposed lack of efficacy in general\" without providing enough support or acknowledging the scientific consensus on the effectiveness of flu vaccines.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for its assertions about the ingredients of the flu shot, such as mercury, and their supposed health risks. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is largely unsubstantiated and provides a more balanced view of the ingredients and their potential effects.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pharmaceutical companies have nefarious intentions and are hiding information about the risks of the flu shot. However, the expert's verdict explains that the profit margins for flu vaccines are generally lower than other drugs and that the companies' profit is not evidence of a faulty product or nefarious intent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the flu shot can cause various health issues, such as Alzheimer's disease, but the expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and evidence that refute these claims."}
