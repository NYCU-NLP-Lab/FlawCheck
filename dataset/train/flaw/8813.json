{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the power outage in Tallahassee after Hurricane Hermine by stating that the city \"didn't have power for weeks\" when in reality, the majority of customers had their power restored within one week.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Mayor Andrew Gillum stood in the way of crews being able to restore power due to their union membership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for the delayed power restoration was because crews were not members of the right union, without providing concrete evidence or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the delayed power restoration, such as coordination issues with visiting crews and the city's engagement of assistance from other utilities."}
