{"Exaggerate": "The claim of 400,000 anchor babies born in the United States a year may be an exaggeration based on outdated estimates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient current data or evidence to support the exact number of anchor babies.", "Problematic assumption": "The term \"anchor babies\" implies intent, but there is no clear evidence to support the assumption that undocumented mothers specifically come to the US to give birth for legal status.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The numbers of anchor babies may have been higher in the mid-2000s due to a larger population of unauthorized immigrants and higher overall birth rates, but current estimates suggest lower numbers."}
