{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Mike Huckabee created a guide to identifying a secret homosexual handshake. The provided information suggests that the image of the secret handshake was already circulating on the internet and it was associated with homosexuals later on.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that Mike Huckabee created the guide. It only mentions that the image was posted on the Facebook page of Mrs. Betty Bowers, which is not clearly identified as satire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a secret homosexual handshake and that Mike Huckabee created a guide to identify it. However, there is no solid evidence or factual basis provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the image of the secret handshake. It only mentions that it was associated with homosexuals when reposted by the Landover Baptist website, but there could be other interpretations or contexts for the image."}
