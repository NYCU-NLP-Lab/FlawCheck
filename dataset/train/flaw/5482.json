{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Trump's hospital records reveal he weighs 322 pounds lacks enough support because the White House has not released Trump's hospital records and his latest physical exam results show he weighs 244 pounds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the hospital records would reveal Trump's weight to be 322 pounds, but there is no evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump's latest physical exam results released by the White House show he weighs 244 pounds, not 322 pounds.", "Understate": "The claim suggests that Trump's previous doctor understated his weight by 83 pounds, implying that his actual weight is higher than reported. However, there is no evidence or confirmation to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on online speculation and lack of transparency from the administration, which can lead to misinformation and viral claims.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents a sensationalized headline about Trump's weight based on unverified information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a result of online speculation and misinformation, rather than being based on verified hospital records."}
