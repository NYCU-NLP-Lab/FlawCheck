{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that AT&T was conducting a forensic audit of Dominion Voting Systems and that the bombing in Nashville was related to this audit. However, AT&T has denied conducting any audit, and there is no evidence to support the claim that the bombing was connected to Dominion or the audit. Therefore, the claim exaggerates the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a Facebook post and has been shared on multiple social media platforms. However, there is no credible evidence or reliable sources provided to support the claim. The lack of supporting evidence weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a connection between the AT&T audit of Dominion Voting Systems and the Nashville bombing. However, there is no factual basis or logical reasoning provided to support this assumption. It is a speculative and unfounded assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim falsely suggests that the bombing in Nashville was related to the AT&T audit of Dominion Voting Systems. However, law enforcement officials have stated that the bombing was carried out by an individual acting alone and there is no evidence linking it to the audit or Dominion. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim."}
