{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of CEOs who resigned and dumped stock in response to advance notice of COVID. Only two CEOs actually resigned and left their companies after the coronavirus surfaced in China.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that CEOs received advance information about the coronavirus and resigned to dump stock.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CEOs' resignations and stock sales were directly related to advance notice of COVID, without considering other possible reasons for their actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations for CEO resignations, such as normal succession planning and board pressure, which contradict the claim's assumption of advance notice of COVID."}
