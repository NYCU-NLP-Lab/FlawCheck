{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which people lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary. This is based on the statement from the Cato Institute study that welfare paid better than a minimum wage job in 34 states, but without further evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that people lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary. The request for more evidence from Rubio's office and the lack of response further highlights this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that government assistance disincentivizes low-income workers from working more hours or striving for a promotion, without considering other potential factors that may influence their decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks alternative explanations for why low-income workers may not work more hours or strive for a promotion, such as lack of access to education or training, limited job opportunities, or systemic barriers."}
