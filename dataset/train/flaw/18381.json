{"Understate": "The claim states that special education categorical aid from the state hasn't been raised in over a decade, which may be an understatement if the actual increase in funding has been lower than inflation or other factors that affect the cost of special education programs.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by the statement from Tony Evers, the Democratic challenger for governor, and the report from the state Department of Public Instruction, there may be a lack of additional evidence or data to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in special education categorical aid is necessary or should be expected, without considering other factors that may affect funding decisions or the allocation of resources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of increase in special education categorical aid, such as changes in special education enrollment or the effectiveness of current funding levels."}
