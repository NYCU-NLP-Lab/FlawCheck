{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Ed Perlmutter voted for \"Viagra for rapists\" paid for with tax dollars. This is an exaggerated interpretation of the health care law and its provisions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation provided to prove that Ed Perlmutter specifically voted for \"Viagra for rapists\" or that such a provision exists in the health care law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the health care law will directly pay for Viagra for rapists. It fails to acknowledge the complexities and regulations involved in the law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the provisions mentioned, such as the possibility that sex offenders may qualify for tax credits and purchase insurance policies with government subsidies, which could potentially cover prescription medications like Viagra."}
