{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of right-to-work laws on the infant mortality rate by stating that it is 15 percent higher in states with such laws.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the infant mortality rate is directly influenced by right-to-work laws.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between right-to-work laws and the infant mortality rate without considering other factors that may contribute to the disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the difference in infant mortality rates between right-to-work states and non-right-to-work states."}
