{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Nigerian pastor has been hospitalized in China due to contracting the coronavirus. The only evidence provided is a viral video of the pastor stating his intention to go to China, which does not confirm his actual travel or hospitalization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pastor's hospitalization in China is directly related to his attempt to \"destroy coronavirus.\" However, there is no concrete evidence linking his hospitalization to his supposed mission.", "Contradict fact": "The claim presents an image alongside the allegation, suggesting that it is a photo of the hospitalized pastor. However, it is revealed that the image is of a deceased Nollywood actor and not the pastor in question, contradicting the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the pastor went to China to \"end\" the coronavirus, implying that he had the ability to single-handedly eradicate the virus. This is an exaggerated claim without sufficient evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and unverified sources to support the allegation. The use of unverified information undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that the pastor's hospitalization, if true, is unrelated to his attempt to combat the coronavirus. There could be other reasons for his hospitalization in China.", "Understate": "There is no evidence in the provided information to suggest that the claim understates any aspect."}
