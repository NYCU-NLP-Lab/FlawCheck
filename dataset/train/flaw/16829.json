{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of local towns tearing up paved roads and replacing them with gravel.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that local towns are tearing up paved roads and replacing them with gravel.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in road construction funding in the state budget is directly causing local towns to tear up paved roads and replace them with gravel, without considering other factors that may be influencing the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why local towns are tearing up paved roads and replacing them with gravel, such as the need for repairs or cost considerations, that are not addressed in the claim."}
