{"Understate": "The claim \"We have never done business with Donald Trump\" understates the fact that there were business dealings between Coastal Construction, owned by Murphy's father, and Trump, although they were not direct contractual agreements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the fact that Coastal Construction had business dealings related to Trump, although not direct contractual agreements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that business dealings must only involve direct contractual agreements, ignoring the possibility of other types of relationships or connections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as Coastal Construction had business dealings related to Trump, but Trump's role was that of a licensor and not a partner in the development process."}
