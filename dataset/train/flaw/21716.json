{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decline in employment in the metals industry since it only mentions a steady decline, while the expert's verdict states that employment has declined by about 42 percent since 1990.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement about the constant production of metals in the U.S. since 1990. However, the expert's verdict provides data and analysis to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in employment in the metals industry is solely due to automation and not influenced by other factors such as foreign competition. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by mentioning that some commentators argue that foreign competition is also a crucial issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in employment, such as the impact of foreign competition or changes in market demand. The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in employment is due to a combination of technological improvements and other factors."}
