{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"Obama secretly flees US - leaves stunning evidence behind\" exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Obama fled the country in secret and left behind substantial evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Obama secretly fled the US and left behind evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's recent trip to New Zealand was related to him wanting to go into hiding due to evidence of collusion with Russia and spying on Trump. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama's trip to New Zealand was already confirmed in late February, long before the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Obama's trip to New Zealand, which is to meet with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and discuss topics such as climate change and social media's impact on politics. This alternative explanation is not considered in the claim."}
