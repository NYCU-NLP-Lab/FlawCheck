{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because the expert's verdict states that the $12 billion figure is based on contributions from immigrants and their employers, which means that it is not solely the undocumented immigrants who are responsible for paying that amount.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the calculation of the $12 billion figure is based on estimates and it is difficult to determine with certainty what portion of total taxes paid and benefits received come from earnings of unauthorized immigrants. This lack of certainty suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all undocumented immigrants who pay into Social Security are hard-working and contribute positively to the economy. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this assumption and it may be problematic to generalize about the entire undocumented immigrant population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations for the $12 billion figure, such as the inclusion of immigrants with temporary legal visas and the exclusion of those in the underground economy who would not pay taxes. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the claim and it may not be entirely accurate."}
