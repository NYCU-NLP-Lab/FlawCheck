{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to definitively determine whether the bottle carried by Gov. Andrew Cuomo was a beer or mineral water.", "Problematic assumption": "Some social media users speculated that the bottle was a beer based on the photographs, but this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photographs strongly suggest that Cuomo was carrying a bottle of mineral water, as it resembled the design of the Saratoga brand. However, due to limited visual clarity, there is a possibility of alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it is unclear what the bottle contained, as confirmed by Snopes' inquiry to Cuomo's press office.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the photographs, as they were published during a period when Cuomo faced mounting pressure to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct."}
