{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim that President Obama received the highest amount of campaign donations from Wall Street in 2008.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of money received from Wall Street directly correlates with the ability to regulate Wall Street effectively, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for President Obama's financial regulations, such as his own beliefs or external factors, which the claim does not consider."}
