{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that fake cigarettes are spreading COVID-19. The report only provides a brief mention of the seizure of fake cigarettes without any concrete evidence linking them to the spread of the virus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the coronavirus first emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, while the seizure of fake cigarettes in Meycauayan City occurred in May 2018. Therefore, it is not possible for these fake cigarettes to be spreading COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between fake cigarettes and the spread of COVID-19 without providing any scientific evidence or expert opinions to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of fake cigarettes by suggesting that they are actively spreading COVID-19. This exaggeration creates a sense of urgency and fear without sufficient evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and reliable information. The report is published on a website that mimics the news organization CNN, lacks a byline, and basic information about its publishers. These factors raise doubts about the credibility and reliability of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the seizure of fake cigarettes, such as concerns about counterfeit products or smuggling, but these are not explored in the claim."}
