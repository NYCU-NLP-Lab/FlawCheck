{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people leaving New York by stating that \"over one million\" people have left in the past decade, when in fact the population loss is around 1 million, not necessarily tied to domestic out-migration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the population loss in New York is solely due to out-migration, without considering other factors such as natural population decline or international migration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that New York leads the nation in out-migration of residents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 126,000 population loss mentioned by Tedisco refers to overall population loss, not just migration out of the state.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the population losses experienced by New York by only focusing on out-migration, without considering the total population decline over the past decade.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the population losses in New York, such as economic factors, high cost of living, or changes in demographics, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the nature of the population losses in New York, as it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation."}
