{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the reform package by stating that Board Supervisors' salaries will be cut by 20 percent and the Board's budget will be cut by 50 percent. This bias is supported by the expert's statement that Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele raised doubts about the significance of the vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the accuracy of the statement. The expert's statement mentions that the board voted to approve a reform package, but it does not provide additional details or evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval of the reform package automatically means that salaries and the budget will be cut. However, the expert's statement mentions that Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has doubts about the significance of the vote, indicating that the assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's statement mentions that there is a state bill seeking to limit the authority, role, and budget of the board. This alternative explanation suggests that the reform package approved by the board may not have the intended impact if the state bill passes."}
