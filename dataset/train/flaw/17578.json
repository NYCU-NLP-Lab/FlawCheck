{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs lost in Florida since the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program. The actual number of job losses is 211,500, not 211,000 as stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to back up the statement that 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs due to the governor's campaign with Barack Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the governor's campaign with Barack Obama and the job losses in Florida, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the job losses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job losses in Florida, such as economic downturn, industry-specific factors, or other policies that may have influenced the job market."}
