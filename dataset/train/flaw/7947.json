{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to prove that President Obama revealed in his State of the Union address that he is now against earmarks. The expert's verdict includes quotes from Obama's speeches and actions related to earmarks, but it does not directly address whether or not he made this specific statement in his State of the Union address.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama changed his stance on earmarks based on the statement made in the State of the Union address. However, the expert's verdict provides information about Obama's previous statements and actions regarding earmarks, indicating that his position has been inconsistent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for Obama's statements and actions on earmarks, such as political compromise or changing circumstances. This suggests that there may be other factors influencing Obama's stance on earmarks, rather than a simple reversal of opinion."}
