Lee's opposition to slavery and secession, ignoring the complexity of his views and actions.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Lee made mixed statements about his feelings toward slavery, particularly towards the end of the war.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Lee opposed both slavery and secession.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Lee's opposition to secession and slavery automatically absolves him from being associated with them, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Lee is associated with slavery and secession, such as his actions during the Civil War to bolster and sustain slavery."}
