{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the rarity of direct lightning strikes to the body and the chances of receiving such a strike twice in a short period of time without suffering extensive injuries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the authenticity of the video clip and its depiction of a man being struck by lightning twice.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video clip is staged/created and not actual camera footage, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the video clip may depict a side flash rather than a direct hit, which contradicts the claim's assertion of a man being struck by lightning twice."}
