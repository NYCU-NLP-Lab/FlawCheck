{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks comprehensive and recent data to support the statement that DUI arrests dropped significantly in Tampa once Uber began operating.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the presence of Uber and a decrease in DUI arrests in Tampa, which may not be the only factor contributing to the change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider other law enforcement agencies that make DUI arrests in Tampa, which could affect the overall number of DUI arrests and potentially explain any fluctuations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in presenting a clear-cut relationship between Uber and DUI arrests, as stated by the experts who found the relationship to be more complex and nuanced.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the relationship between DUIs and Uber in Tampa is not as clear-cut as presented by the claimant.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of other factors, such as law enforcement efforts or public awareness campaigns, on the decrease in DUI arrests in Tampa.", "Exaggerate": "It is unclear if the claim exaggerates the significance of Uber's presence on the decrease in DUI arrests, as the data provided is limited and cherry-picked."}
