Scott Walker and Republicans, without considering other factors or circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the state's financial situation, such as the availability of other tools to address any shortfall, which were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the $541 million tax cut signed by Gov. Walker, as it also included reductions in property and income taxes for families and businesses, and zeroed out income taxes for Wisconsin manufacturers."}
