{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that they couldn't find any credible evidence that Eric Trump actually made the comments mentioned in the claim. This suggests that the claim lacks sufficient support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the founders intended for the president to have the authority to choose governors, senators, and congressmen. This assumption is not supported by any evidence and can be considered problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the claim is false and contradicts the fact that only the president should have an election."}
