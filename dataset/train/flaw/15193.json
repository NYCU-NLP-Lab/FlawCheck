{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they asked the Trump campaign for details but are still waiting to hear back. This suggests that there is a lack of supporting evidence for Trump's claim that he recommended Ohio as the convention city.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict points out that Trump's statement seems odd because of the timing. The Republican National Committee had already named a site selection committee and had narrowed down the choices before Cleveland was ultimately picked. This suggests that Trump's claim assumes he had a significant role in the selection process, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that they found no evidence or statement from Trump regarding the selection of Cleveland as the convention city. Instead, they found articles about the closure of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Trump's claim, such as him not being involved or not considering Ohio as a recommendation at the time.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that they spoke to a member of the site selection committee who does not recall Trump's name coming up in any meeting. This contradicts Trump's claim that he recommended Ohio as the convention city.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that they are still waiting to hear back from the Trump campaign for details. This suggests that the claim may falter at times due to a lack of information or response.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence or statement provided in the expert's verdict that suggests an understatement bias in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence or statement provided in the expert's verdict that suggests an exaggeration bias in the claim."}
