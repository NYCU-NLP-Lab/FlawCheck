{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it fails to distinguish between the detention of unaccompanied minors under Obama and the separation of children from their parents at the border under Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that \"no one cared\" about the detention of over 90,000 kids under Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the detention of unaccompanied minors under Obama is comparable to the separation of children from their parents at the border under Trump.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the detention of unaccompanied minors under Obama was governed by different laws and policies compared to the separation of children under Trump's zero-tolerance policy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was significant political backlash and criticism of the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the border, suggesting that \"no one cared\" is an exaggeration.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of children detained under Obama by only mentioning the figure of 90,000, without providing context or comparison to the number of children separated under Trump's policy."}
