{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the director of the FBI, James Comey, by stating that he said \"we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East.\" In reality, Comey was discussing a flaw in the vetting process and emphasizing that it had improved significantly in recent years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Comey applies to all people coming from the Middle East, when in fact it was specifically related to the vetting process for Syrian refugees.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that the director of the FBI made the statement mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the statement made by Comey was taken out of context and distorted to support a particular political agenda.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States has a thorough vetting process in place for refugees, involving multiple government agencies, including the FBI, and extensive background checks.", "Understate": "The claim understates the improvements made in the vetting process for refugees, as highlighted by Comey, by suggesting that it is inadequate or ineffective.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the specific focus of Comey's statement, which was on Syrian refugees rather than all people coming from the Middle East."}
