{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that there is a $12 billion hole in the state budget, while the expert's analysis suggests that the adjusted figures amount to $11.8 billion, which is close to the claim but not exactly $12 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide detailed evidence or sources to back up the assertion of a $12 billion hole in the budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a balanced budget cannot have any holes or gaps, which may be a problematic assumption as budgets can still be considered balanced even if they have certain deficits or underfunded areas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation for the claimed hole in the budget, attributing it to lawmakers not covering the full projected costs of Medicaid and public schools, as well as diverting funds from dedicated accounts. This suggests that there are alternative factors contributing to the budget hole rather than simply a lack of balance."}
