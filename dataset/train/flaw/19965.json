{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people who became citizens instead of being deported, stating it could be as high as 1,800 when the actual number is 858.", "Understate": "The claim understates the problem by only mentioning 800 people when the actual number is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the number of people becoming citizens instead of being deported is due to corruption or pressing the wrong button, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why individuals may have become citizens instead of being deported, such as incomplete fingerprint records or old paper-based records missing from the digital repository."}
