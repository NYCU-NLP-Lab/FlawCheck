{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of COVID-19 on the death rate in Chicago, as the expert's verdict states that deaths don't appear to be declining.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or data provided to support the statement that COVID-19 actually lowered the death rate in Chicago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in murders in Chicago in March 2020 is directly attributed to COVID-19, which is a problematic assumption as officials have not made that attribution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in murders in Chicago in March 2020, and COVID-19 may not be the sole factor contributing to it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that deaths don't appear to be declining in Chicago, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of COVID-19 on the death rate in Chicago, as it suggests that the virus actually lowered the death rate without providing sufficient evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the death rate in Chicago and only focusing on a specific aspect (murders) without considering other causes of death."}
