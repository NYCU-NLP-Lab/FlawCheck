{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook page in question was either made private or removed entirely by Facebook, and only an archived version of the post is available. This lack of current evidence may lead to a bias of insufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that social media users may have been skeptical about the authenticity of the meme because it seemed unlikely for a pro-law enforcement page to share such a callous meme. This assumption about the behavior of a pro-police page could introduce a bias.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Facebook page is not the official page of the Chicago Police Department, but rather a group of current or former law enforcement members. The fact that the page has been known to push misinformation and racist content suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the existence of the meme, such as the actions of individuals within the group rather than an endorsement by the entire page.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that the Facebook page shared a meme mocking Jacob Blake, who was paralyzed after being shot in the back by a police officer. The expert's verdict confirms that the meme was indeed posted by the Facebook page, contradicting any claim that it did not happen.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the expert's verdict, as it provides factual information and analysis rather than making exaggerated claims.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the expert's verdict, as it provides a detailed analysis and explanation of the situation.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the expert's verdict faltering at times, as it provides consistent information and analysis throughout."}
