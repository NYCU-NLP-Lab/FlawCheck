{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"we got a very large percentage of the, quote, conservative vote\" is an exaggeration because the actual percentage of conservative Republican voters who voted for McCain in the Florida primary was less than half and lower than his opponent, Mitt Romney.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual support McCain received from conservative voters in Florida, as the exit poll results show that only 29% of self-described conservative Republican voters voted for him.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert provides evidence from exit poll results in Florida, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, which indicate that McCain did not have a significant majority of conservative voters in those states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that winning a Republican-only primary in Florida and receiving a lower percentage of conservative votes than his opponent can be considered a \"very large percentage\" of conservative support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations for McCain's lower support among conservative voters, such as his inability to coalesce the conservative vote and the fact that more conservative voters tended to vote for Romney or Huckabee instead."}
