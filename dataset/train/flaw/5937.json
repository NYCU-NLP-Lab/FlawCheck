{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Virginia made \"the largest investment ever in K-12 education\" is an exaggeration, as it is not supported when adjusted for inflation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is not supported by enough evidence or data, as it only relies on raw dollars without considering inflation-adjusted figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the largest investment in K-12 education is solely determined by raw dollars, without considering other factors such as inflation or the overall economic context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the adjusted figures show that the highest investment in K-12 education occurred in the 2008-09 school year, not during McAuliffe's governorship."}
