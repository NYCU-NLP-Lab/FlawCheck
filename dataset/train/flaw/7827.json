{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific details or evidence about the fine imposed on the Golden State Fence Company for hiring workers without documentation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fine imposed on the Golden State Fence Company for hiring workers without documentation is connected to the construction of a border wall. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the workers were hired specifically for this purpose.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the fine by stating that it was $5 million. This may be seen as an attempt to emphasize the severity of the company's actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fine was levied in December 2006 during the George W. Bush administration, not during the Trump administration as some viewers assumed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the company's hiring of undocumented workers by implying that it was limited to the construction of a border wall. In reality, the company was found to have hired undocumented workers for a variety of projects over the years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for why the Golden State Fence Company hired workers without documentation. It does not explore possible motivations or circumstances that led to this action."}
