{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that Obama was tapping his phones in October is presented as a \"fact\" without any evidence to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is made without providing any evidence to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "President Trump assumes that the alleged surveillance is illegal and compares it to the criminal acts of Nixon/Watergate, without providing any evidence or justification for these claims.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement issued by the White House press secretary, who stated that the investigation into potentially politically motivated investigations in 2016 is separate from the claim of Obama tapping Trump's phones.", "Understate": "There is no evidence provided to support the claim, therefore it understates the need for factual support in making such a serious allegation.", "Falters at times": "The White House remained silent for a day before providing a statement to address the claim, which suggests a lack of consistency or clarity in their response.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim is made without considering any alternative explanations for any potential surveillance or investigations that may have taken place."}
