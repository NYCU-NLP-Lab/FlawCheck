{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of U.S.-born Hispanics turning 18 and becoming eligible to vote by stating that it is 50,000 every month, without providing enough evidence to support this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the number of U.S.-born Hispanics turning 18 and becoming eligible to vote. The evidence provided by the expert is based on a research report from the Pew Hispanic Center, but it is not clear if this report specifically supports the claim's exact number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all U.S.-born Hispanics who turn 18 will automatically become eligible to vote, which may not be accurate as there may be other factors that determine eligibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the fact that other population groups, such as non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, also have significant numbers of individuals turning 18 and becoming eligible to vote. This alternative explanation challenges the notion that U.S.-born Hispanics turning 18 are the only significant group in terms of electoral strength."}
