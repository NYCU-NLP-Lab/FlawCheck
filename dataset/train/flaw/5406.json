{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of small businesses going out of business by using the phrase \"in record numbers.\" The data shows that while there was a peak during the recession, the number of business deaths had fallen back to previous levels by 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that small businesses are going out of business in record numbers. The data provided contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that small businesses are currently going out of business in record numbers without providing evidence to support this assumption. The data suggests that the trend has improved in recent years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of small businesses going out of business has actually decreased since the peak in 2009. The data shows that the number of business deaths had fallen back to previous levels by 2012.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the current situation for small businesses by not considering more recent data. The expert mentions that data for the last couple of years is not available, and if the trend from 2010 to 2012 holds, it would likely paint an improved picture.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the closure of small businesses, such as changes in market conditions or other factors that may contribute to business closures. The data provided only focuses on the number of business deaths without exploring potential causes."}
