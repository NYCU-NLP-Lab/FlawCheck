{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of undocumented workers who are contributing to Social Security by stating that \"millions\" are paying $12 billion a year, when the actual estimate is around 3.1 million workers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that undocumented workers are contributing $12 billion a year to Social Security. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Social Security Administration, but it does not provide additional sources or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all undocumented workers who are contributing to Social Security are doing so willingly and intentionally. It does not consider the possibility that some workers may be paying into the system unknowingly or under false identities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the $12 billion in contributions to Social Security. It attributes the entire amount to undocumented workers, without considering other sources such as employers who may be paying on behalf of their undocumented employees.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only half of the $12 billion in contributions to Social Security from undocumented workers is actually paid by the workers themselves, with the other half being paid by their employers."}
