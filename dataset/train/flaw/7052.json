{"Lack enough support": "The initial claim lacked sufficient supporting information from Sen. Mitch McConnell's office.", "Falters at times": "The fact-checkers initially rated the claim as Mostly False but later changed it to Mostly True after considering additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The initial claim assumed that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had instructed insurance companies not to inform policyholders about the impact of Obamacare, but the supporting evidence did not directly address this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The letter from CMS to Humana only addressed the communication between a government contractor and Medicare beneficiaries, and it did not mention private insurance companies communicating with policyholders, which could suggest an alternative explanation for the claim."}
