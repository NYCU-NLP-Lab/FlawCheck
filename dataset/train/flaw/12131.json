{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which corporate taxes will be the highest in the industrialized world, as it fails to mention that Japan plans to lower its corporate tax rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one source (a Wall Street Journal op-ed) and does not provide any additional evidence or data to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high corporate taxes are inhibiting business growth without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why corporate taxes may be high or the potential benefits they may bring.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Japan currently has a higher corporate tax rate than the United States, and that Japan plans to lower its rate in the near future."}
