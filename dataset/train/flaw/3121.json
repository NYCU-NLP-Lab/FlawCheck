{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of right-to-work laws on site selectors' decisions to favor certain states over others. The expert's verdict mentions a survey where 72 percent of corporate executives considered right-to-work legislation important, but it does not provide evidence of a direct causation between these laws and site selectors' decisions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that site selectors consistently shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of right-to-work states like Iowa, Indiana, and Michigan. The expert's verdict mentions a survey and quotes from consultants, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or data on the actual decisions made by site selectors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence or absence of right-to-work laws is the sole determining factor for site selectors when deciding where businesses expand or relocate. However, there may be various other factors that influence these decisions, such as infrastructure, tax incentives, workforce skills, and market demand.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why businesses may choose to expand or relocate to certain states. It solely attributes the decision to the presence or absence of right-to-work laws, neglecting other potential factors that may influence site selectors' decisions.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of site selectors' decision-making process and oversimplifying it by solely focusing on the impact of right-to-work laws. The expert's verdict mentions that manufacturing companies may be more likely to avoid unions, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the factors that site selectors consider.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis or data to support its assertion. It relies on general statements and anecdotal evidence without presenting a thorough examination of the topic."}
