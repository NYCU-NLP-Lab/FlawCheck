{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that \"Queens Village voters in NYC are receiving pre-filled out ballots for Joe Biden.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the ballot in question was the result of a voter's error and not a deliberate act by the Board of Elections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to substantiate the allegation. The expert's verdict mentions that the video in which the filled-in ballot was displayed is no longer available, and the Board of Elections confirmed that the voter in question had received a blank ballot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pre-filled ballots are illegal, without providing any evidence or legal basis for this assumption. The expert's verdict states that the Board of Elections disputed the allegation and called it \"the height of irresponsibility.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the filled-in ballot, stating that it was the result of a voter's error rather than any intentional action by the Board of Elections."}
