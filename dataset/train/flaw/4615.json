{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documentation to support its validity. The only source is a single anecdotal tweet that has not been verified or substantiated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump refused to allow a marine engineer on board his yacht solely because the man was black. This assumption may be problematic as it is based on an unverified personal anecdote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the alleged incident, such as misunderstandings, miscommunication, or other factors that were not mentioned or explored in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its credibility and reliability due to the lack of supporting evidence and the inconsistencies in the account provided by the individual making the claim."}
