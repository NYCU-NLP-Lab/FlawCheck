{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Gov. Rick Scott's approval ratings are up lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The expert's verdict mentions two different polls, but it does not provide specific approval rating numbers or a comparison to previous ratings.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that Scott's budget proposal includes cuts to the corporate tax rate and school property taxes, but it is not clear how these specific proposals relate to his approval ratings. The assumption that Scott's approval ratings are directly linked to his budget proposals is not adequately supported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict raises the question of whether Kilmeade's statement about Scott's approval ratings is accurate. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing Scott's approval ratings, such as his positions on polarizing issues or other external factors not mentioned in the provided information.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Scott's positions have been polarizing on some issues, indicating that his approval ratings may not be consistently high. This suggests that the claim of his approval ratings being up may falter or fluctuate depending on the specific issues or context.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict provides evidence from a PPP poll that shows Scott's negative numbers had actually gotten worse since taking office. This contradicts the claim that his approval ratings are up.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state that the claim exaggerates or overstates Scott's approval ratings. However, the mention of negative numbers worsening suggests that the claim may understate the actual state of Scott's approval ratings."}
