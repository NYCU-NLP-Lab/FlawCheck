{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the value of opened VHS copies of \"Black Diamond Collection\" and \"Masterpiece\" editions of Disney animated films, stating that they are not worth hundreds or thousands of dollars.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the listed VHS movies can actually fetch a nice sum for owners. The expert's verdict mentions that the value claimed by Direct Expose and Ice Pop is not supported by actual sales data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all VHS tapes in mint condition can sell for significant amounts on eBay, but the expert's verdict highlights that only a small number of extremely high-priced eBay listings may not have been paid for, and most of these listings came from new seller accounts with a 0 rating.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the high-priced eBay listings for the listed VHS tapes may be some sort of scam, as they were mostly made by brand-new sellers with low seller ratings."}
