{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of FDA regulations in creating barriers to private industry creating a test quickly for the coronavirus. While FDA regulations do play a role in the approval process, there are other factors at play, such as flawed initial test kits and the need for Emergency Use Authorization.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the testing process and the various factors that contributed to delays. It simplifies the issue by solely blaming FDA regulations, without acknowledging other challenges faced by health officials and agencies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that FDA regulations were the primary cause of barriers to private industry creating a test quickly for the coronavirus. The spokesperson for Crenshaw points to articles from various sources, but it is unclear if these articles provide comprehensive evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the FDA regulations were the main obstacle to private industry creating a test quickly. It does not consider other potential factors or alternative explanations for the delays in testing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the barriers to private industry creating a test quickly, such as flawed initial test kits, limited resources, or the need for Emergency Use Authorization.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that federal health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the inevitability of the virus spread and urged people to take precautions, indicating that they were aware of the need for testing. This contradicts the claim that FDA regulations were solely responsible for the barriers to testing.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the various factors that contributed to delays in testing. It focuses primarily on FDA regulations, neglecting other important aspects of the testing process."}
