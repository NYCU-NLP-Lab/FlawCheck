However, there is no direct evidence or verification of the location or context of the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video, which is being shared with the claim, is actually from Bangladesh and involves a different individual and school. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the incident took place in a madrasa in India.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from Bangladesh, not India. It misrepresents the location and context of the incident.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the seriousness of the issue by focusing solely on madrasas and not addressing the broader issue of sexual harassment in educational institutions in general.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim itself, as it simply states the occurrence of sexual harassment in a madrasa in India. However, the claim may be exaggerated by those who are using it to call for a ban on all madrasas based on this isolated incident.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability, as it misrepresents the location and context of the incident and lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation of sexual harassment in a madrasa in India."}
