{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks recent evidence to support the assertion that Congressman Jeff Denham agrees that all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested, and deported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Denham's stance on immigration has remained unchanged since the 2010 debate, without providing evidence of his current views.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that Denham's views on immigration may have evolved or changed over time.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing more recent evidence or statements from Denham to support the assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Denham's actual stance on immigration, as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of his views or actions on the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Denham is considered a moderate on immigration reform within the GOP and has co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform package introduced by Democrats.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Denham's stance on immigration by stating that he agrees that \"all\" illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested, and deported without providing sufficient evidence."}
