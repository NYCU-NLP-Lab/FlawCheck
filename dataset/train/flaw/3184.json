{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no other studies specifically analyzing the employment impact of the American Power Act, and the Peterson Institute study is the only one available at the time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that every major study done by a legitimate group would come to the same conclusion about the job creation potential of the cap-and-trade legislation, which may not be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations as other economic studies of generic cap-and-trade plans, as well as ones analyzing the version passed by the House, have reached conclusions about job impact that contradict the findings of the Peterson Institute."}
