{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that the Muslims entered the tribal land to offer namaz on Eid, and the tribals attacked them fearing a land grabbing attempt. The evidence provided does not clearly support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Muslims entered the tribal land with the intention of occupying it, which may be a problematic assumption without sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided in the expert's verdict does not offer enough support to conclusively prove the claim. The photographs and reports mentioned do not explicitly mention the motive behind the attack or the intention of the Muslims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the clash between the two groups that are not mentioned in the claim or the evidence provided. The claim does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the incident.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and accurate representation of the events. The evidence provided does not offer a comprehensive and consistent account of the incident.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the facts presented in the evidence. The expert's verdict mentions that the OpIndia article and the Twitter handle attributed information to Dainik Jagran that could not be found in the report. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by simplifying it to a conflict between Muslims and tribals over land grabbing. The evidence provided suggests that there may be more nuanced factors at play in the incident."}
