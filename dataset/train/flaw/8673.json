{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of out-of-state legislators in the House and state Senate by stating that \"over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia.\" The actual numbers show that there is a net addition of only four members born outside the state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides the number of legislators born inside and outside Virginia without further analysis or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being born outside Virginia makes legislators \"not even Virginians by grace yet,\" implying that they are not fully connected to the state's culture. This assumption is problematic and may be biased.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in out-of-state legislators, such as population shifts, political alignments, or qualifications of the candidates."}
