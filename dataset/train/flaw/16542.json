{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the film and TV industry in Georgia by stating that it supports more than 24,000 direct jobs and pays local workers more than $1.68 billion in wages. This could potentially be an overstatement of the actual impact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the numbers of jobs and wages mentioned. It simply refers to a press release from the Motion Picture Association of America, which may not be sufficient evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the film and TV industry's impact on Georgia is solely positive, without considering any potential negative consequences or trade-offs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data released by the Motion Picture Association of America was part of a push for Trade Promotion Authority, suggesting that there may be alternative motives or reasons for promoting the industry's impact in Georgia.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a comprehensive and unbiased view of the film and TV industry's impact in Georgia. It may not consider potential drawbacks or limitations of the industry's presence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating the impact of the film and TV industry in Georgia."}
