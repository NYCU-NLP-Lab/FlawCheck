{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Covid-19 does not exist and that the current measures are a freedom grab, without providing sufficient evidence to support these claims.", "Understate": "The claim understates the effectiveness of social distancing and masks by stating that there is no science behind these measures and that they are proven harmful to health and immunity. This contradicts official advice from the NHS and the World Health Organization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for its statements about the PCR test, vaccines, and the global population having permanent chronic illness and Autism. It does not provide any evidence or sources to back up these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graphic is genuine and issued by the UK's NHS, despite the NHS denying producing it. This assumption undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the graphic was created by an Australia-based Instagram user and does not reflect the official stance of the UK's NHS."}
