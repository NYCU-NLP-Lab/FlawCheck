{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the total number of jobs that depend on trade with Mexico and Canada in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict states that the total number of jobs is actually more than 230,000, while the claim only mentions 44,000 jobs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is supported by a graphic attributed to the National Association of Manufacturers, but it does not provide any additional sources or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all jobs dependent on trade with Mexico and Canada in Wisconsin are manufacturing jobs. The expert's verdict points out that the claim omits the word \"manufacturing,\" indicating that it is not limited to manufacturing jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the total number of jobs supported by trade with Mexico and Canada is actually more than 230,000, not just the mentioned 44,000 jobs. This suggests that there are alternative ways to interpret the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the total number of jobs supported by trade with Mexico and Canada in Wisconsin is actually more than 230,000, not just 44,000 jobs.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of trade with Mexico and Canada on job dependence in Wisconsin by only mentioning 44,000 jobs when the actual number is much higher.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by omitting the word \"manufacturing,\" which leads to a misunderstanding of the specific types of jobs dependent on trade with Mexico and Canada in Wisconsin."}
