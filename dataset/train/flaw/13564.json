{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the gas prices under the Obama-Biden administration by stating that they averaged well over $5 per gallon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that gas prices averaged well over $5 per gallon under Obama and Biden.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high gas prices during a specific period were solely due to the actions of Obama and Biden, without considering other factors such as global oil prices or geopolitical tensions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average national gas price over the eight years of the Obama-Biden administration was $2.96 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for gas prices, such as fluctuations in global oil markets and geopolitical factors, which can impact prices regardless of the administration in power."}
