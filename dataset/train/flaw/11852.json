{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of dropping Common Core on the school's performance by stating that it \"soars to number one\" without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate its assertion that dropping Common Core was the driving force behind the school's high test scores.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rejection of Common Core was the sole reason for the school's success, without considering other factors that may have contributed to its performance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the charter school never actually adopted Common Core in the first place, making it illogical to attribute its success to dropping it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the school's high test scores, such as the school's specific curriculum or teaching methods.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying the impact of Common Core on student performance and implying that dropping it automatically leads to improved outcomes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on misleading or false information, as fact-checkers have rated it as false and the school principal disputes the claim."}
