{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by offenders with no prior convictions. The expert's verdict suggests that first-time offenders are not truly \"first-time\" drunk drivers and have likely driven drunk multiple times before being arrested.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions. However, the expert's verdict points out that the statistic focuses on drivers who had been drinking, which is a broader category than just \"drunken drivers.\"", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the best data found does not directly address who caused the accidents, indicating that there may not be enough support for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the statistic provided by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation does not consider drivers' complete records and only counts post-1989 convictions as \"prior.\" This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not accurately reflect the true causes of drunk driving deaths and injuries.", "Understate": "It is unclear if there is any understatement bias present in the claim based on the information provided."}
