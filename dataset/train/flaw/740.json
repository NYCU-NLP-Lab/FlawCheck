{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"doubling and tripling your taxes\" is an exaggeration according to the expert's verdict. Biden's tax plan would result in increases of less than 6% for the majority of Americans and an average increase of about 40% for the top 1% of earners.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or analysis to back up the assertion that taxes would be doubled or tripled under Biden's tax plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden's tax plan would result in significant tax increases for all individuals, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that the increases would mainly fall on high-income earners and corporations, and would not nearly double or triple taxes for people at any income level on average.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden's tax plan does not propose doubling or tripling taxes. The expert's verdict provides evidence from multiple analyses that debunk this claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim as it is making an exaggerated assertion rather than downplaying the impact of Biden's tax plan.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times. The expert's verdict consistently refutes the claim and provides evidence to support their assessment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias in the claim as it does not present any alternative explanations for the potential impact of Biden's tax plan."}
