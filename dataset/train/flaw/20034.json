{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Glenn Grothman that the federal government is currently borrowing 20% of the budget may be an exaggeration. The expert's analysis shows that the borrowing figure has actually decreased to 13.8% and is predicted to drop further in the future.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the federal government is currently borrowing 20% of the budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the borrowing figure of 20% indicates significant differences in government spending between President Obama and Glenn Grothman. However, the expert's analysis suggests that the decreasing borrowing figure does not necessarily support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the borrowing figure, such as the economic recovery boosting tax revenues and reducing the need for emergency assistance, which have contributed to the decrease in deficits during President Obama's presidency."}
