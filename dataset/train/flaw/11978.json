{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Obamacare is the \"biggest tax increase in American history\" may be seen as an exaggeration, as it fails to consider inflation-adjusted figures and other measures of tax increases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one article from FactCheck.org, which itself concludes that the attack is misleading and the raw-dollar measure is a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the size of a tax increase can be determined solely by raw dollar amounts, disregarding other factors such as inflation and the percentage of GDP.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations, such as the Forbes opinion column that argues the reform law is the largest tax increase when considering premiums paid for health insurance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that, when adjusted for inflation, a tax hike under GOP President Ronald Reagan in 1982 is the largest tax increase, not Obamacare.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively using evidence that supports its argument while ignoring contradictory evidence that undermines its validity.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
