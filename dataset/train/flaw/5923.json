{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in turnout between the Patriots' visit with President Trump and their visit with President Obama. The photos provided in the claim lack context and do not accurately represent the full turnout of the team.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to accurately compare the turnout for the Patriots' visits with both presidents. The photos provided in the claim do not provide a comprehensive view of the entire team and staff present.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in turnout between the Patriots' visits with President Trump and President Obama is significant. However, the claim does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the difference in the photos. The Patriots pointed out that in 2017, more than 40 staff members were seated on the South Lawn instead of lining the staircases, which could have affected the visual representation of the turnout."}
