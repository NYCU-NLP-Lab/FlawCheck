{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that six states \"decided to stop counting\" votes, when in fact, none of the states mentioned in the claim stopped counting votes altogether on election night.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that six states stopped counting votes. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to pause or delay counting votes in certain states was done with the intention of favoring Joe Biden, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The delays in election results were due to an influx of mail-in ballots, not because the states decided to stop counting votes. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged in the claim."}
