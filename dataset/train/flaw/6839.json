{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ronald Reagan said he felt like he \"was the one shaking hands with the president\" when he met Donald Trump.

However, the expert's verdict suggests that there is no basis for such an assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that while there are photos of Reagan and Trump together, the meetings did not inspire Reagan to speak highly of Trump as claimed in the post.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the meeting between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump by attributing a profound statement to Reagan that he never actually made.", "Understate": "There doesn't appear to be any understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a false statement attributed to Ronald Reagan, which is contradicted by the expert's verdict.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases listed (Falters at times, Exaggerate, Understate) are applicable to the claim or the expert's verdict."}
