{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that 58 cents out of every R1 paid in taxes goes towards paying the salaries of public servants, while the expert's verdict indicates that public servant salaries will take 51.4 cents out of every R1 in total taxes.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual amount of tax revenue used for public servant salaries, as the expert's verdict mentions that the wage bill plus debt repayments together take up 72.4% of tax revenue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific sources or evidence to back up the claim, whereas the expert's verdict refers to the South Africa's June 2020 supplementary budget and the statements made by the finance minister and the shadow minister.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all tax revenue is used solely for paying the salaries of public servants, but the expert's verdict mentions that the main budget revenue comes from various sources, including non-tax revenue.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that gross tax revenue was reduced and the government is now anticipating R304 billion less than expected, which may impact the amount of tax money going towards public servant salaries."}
