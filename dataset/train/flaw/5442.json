Jim Doyle and the DNR have mismanaged the deer herd and put hunters last.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the deer population is solely due to mismanagement by Gov. Jim Doyle and the DNR, without considering other factors such as habitat loss or natural population fluctuations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the deer population, such as environmental factors or changes in hunting practices."}
