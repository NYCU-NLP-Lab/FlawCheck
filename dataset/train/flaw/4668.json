{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Boris Johnson said his party has \"wiped out the national debt\" lacks evidence or any concrete support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Conservatives nearly doubled the debt from \u00a3950 billion to \u00a31.8 trillion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Boris Johnson made the statement, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual debt figures by not mentioning the current debt of \u00a31.8 trillion (81% of GDP) and the debt of just over \u00a31 trillion (64% of GDP) in May 2010.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the achievement of \"wiping out the national debt\" by Boris Johnson's party, as there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "It is possible that Boris Johnson made the claim somewhere other than during his keynote conference speech, but there is no evidence to support this alternative explanation."}
