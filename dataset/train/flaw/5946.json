{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the extent to which the FBI can block individuals from purchasing dynamite or an AK-47, as the expert's verdict mentions that the FBI can set off notifications and take enhanced investigative methods in response to such purchases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the FBI doesn't have the power to block individuals from buying dynamite or an AK-47. The expert's verdict provides some information on FBI notifications and counterterrorism investigations but doesn't fully address the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ability to prevent terror suspects from boarding airplanes should also extend to blocking them from buying dynamite or an AK-47. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the different regulations and authorities involved in aviation security and firearms sales.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that the lack of power to block individuals from buying dynamite or an AK-47 is a flaw or inconsistency in the system. However, there may be alternative explanations for why such power is not granted, such as constitutional rights or the need for due process in restricting access to firearms."}
