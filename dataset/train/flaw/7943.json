{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as the growth rate of Hispanic-owned businesses is not exactly three times the national average, but slightly more than twice as fast.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on data from the Census Bureau survey conducted in 2010, and the most recent data available is from 2007.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth rate of Hispanic-owned businesses is directly related to the population growth of the Hispanic community, which may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the higher growth rate of Hispanic-owned businesses, such as specific economic or cultural factors that are unique to the Hispanic community."}
