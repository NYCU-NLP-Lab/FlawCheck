{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in the value of the minimum wage today compared to 1968. The expert's investigation found different calculations and interpretations of the data, suggesting that the claim may not accurately represent the extent of the difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific details about the study it is referencing. The expert's investigation reveals that the study mentioned by the congressman is not directly analyzing the minimum wage but rather quoting another study. This lack of direct analysis weakens the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the value of the minimum wage is solely determined by inflation. However, the expert's investigation reveals that there are different calculations and interpretations of the data, suggesting that other factors may also contribute to the difference in value.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation highlights alternative calculations and interpretations of the data, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the difference in the value of the minimum wage today compared to 1968. This indicates that the claim may not consider other factors that could contribute to the difference."}
