However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the changes were related to the removal of certain protections for small-scale farmers, rather than a complete loss of rights.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to substantiate the assertion that Michigan residents lost their farming rights. The expert's verdict provides additional context and information to clarify the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the impact of the changes in law."}
