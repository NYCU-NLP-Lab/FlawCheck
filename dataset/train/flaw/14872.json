{"Lack enough support": "The claim that each person in Nigeria generates an average of 0.65 kg of waste per day lacks sufficient supporting evidence. The expert's verdict does not provide any specific data or sources to back up this claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration considering that the expert's verdict states that Nigeria generates over 62 million tonnes of waste a year. If each person were to generate 0.65 kg of waste per day, the total waste generation would be significantly higher than the reported 62 million tonnes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that waste generation is uniform across all individuals in Nigeria. However, this may not be the case as waste generation can vary depending on various factors such as lifestyle, income, and location.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that Lagos alone has an estimated waste generation of over 15,000 tonnes every day. If this fact is accurate, it suggests that the average waste generation per person in Nigeria is likely to be higher than 0.65 kg per day.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for waste generation in Nigeria. Factors such as population density, urbanization, and industrial activities may contribute to higher waste generation rates in certain regions or among specific demographics."}
