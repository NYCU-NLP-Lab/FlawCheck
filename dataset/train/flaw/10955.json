{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Eric Cantor \"voted to fully fund Obamacare in October\" lacks enough support as it is based on Cantor's vote for a continuing appropriations bill that funded federal programs, including Obamacare, for a finite period of three months.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for the appropriations bill that funded federal programs, including Obamacare, means fully funding the law. However, experts argue that this is a problematic assumption as it does not imply an endorsement of Obamacare or funding for more than a finite period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cantor has been at the center of dozens of Republican attempts to repeal or gut the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that he is not soft on Obamacare.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Cantor's opposition to Obamacare by solely focusing on one vote for a continuing appropriations bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Cantor's vote for the appropriations bill, which was to end a federal government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, rather than a direct endorsement or full funding of Obamacare.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not considering the broader context of Cantor's stance on Obamacare and his involvement in attempts to repeal or gut the law.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Cantor's support for Obamacare by implying that his vote for the appropriations bill equates to full funding of the law, which experts argue is not the case."}
