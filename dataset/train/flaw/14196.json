{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of debt reduction during the Clinton presidency by stating that $600 billion was paid down on the national debt, when in reality, one form of debt dropped by nearly $453 billion and the total debt increased by roughly $400 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement about balancing the budget and achieving surplus budgets.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in one form of debt is equivalent to a reduction in the national debt as a whole, which is a problematic assumption as the total debt increased during the same period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that while Clinton achieved four consecutive surplus budgets, the reduction in the national debt was not as significant as claimed due to other factors such as the increase in total debt.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were previous periods of at least four consecutive surplus budgets, such as the period between fiscal years 1927 and 1930, which undermines the claim of it being the first time in more than 70 years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a misleading picture of the debt reduction during the Clinton presidency, failing to accurately represent the increase in total debt despite the surplus budgets."}
