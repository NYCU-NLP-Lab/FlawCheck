{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency compared to Ronald Reagan's presidency. The expert's verdict states that the increase in employed people was 18% under Reagan and 21% under Clinton, which is not a hundred times more as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty was a hundred times more under Clinton. The expert's verdict provides statistical data comparing the employment numbers under both presidents, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim of a hundred times difference.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty is solely due to the policies implemented by the presidents. However, the expert's verdict does not analyze the specific policies or factors that contributed to the changes in employment and poverty rates, suggesting that the claim's assumption may be problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in employed people was higher under Clinton's presidency compared to Reagan's presidency, but not a hundred times more as stated. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the claim is not accurate in terms of the actual numbers.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the positive impact of Reagan's presidency on job creation and poverty reduction by suggesting that it was significantly lower than Clinton's. However, the expert's verdict does not explicitly address this bias.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations for the difference in the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty between the two presidencies."}
