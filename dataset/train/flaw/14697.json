{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Pennsylvania is the \"only state in the country not to tax drillers,\" when in fact there are other states without a severance tax on natural gas extraction, such as Iowa.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Pennsylvania is the only state without a severance tax on drillers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that drillers in Pennsylvania have not paid their fair share, without providing sufficient evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Pennsylvania may not have a severance tax, such as the imposition of impact fees and the distribution of revenue to local and state governments to offset impacts associated with natural gas drilling."}
