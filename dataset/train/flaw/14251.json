{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish the credibility of the discovery. The articles do not provide information about how the discovery was deemed credible or verified.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the correlation between stars and Mayan cities found by the Canadian teen is a valid method of discovering lost cities. This assumption may be problematic as it is not supported by previous scientific research or expertise.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of its credibility. The articles mention that the boy's study focus was inspired by 2012 Mayan doomsday prophecies, which raises questions about the motivations and biases behind the discovery.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the correlation between stars and Mayan cities. It presents the discovery as a definitive finding without exploring other potential factors or variables that could explain the correlation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the discovery by presenting it as a simple correlation between stars and Mayan cities. The articles mention that if the satellite photographs are verified, the city would be among the largest Mayan population centers ever discovered, suggesting a much greater significance.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact and novelty of the discovery by stating that \"no other scientist had ever found such a correlation.\" This statement implies that the Canadian teen's discovery is groundbreaking and unprecedented, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Contradict fact": "No clear contradiction of facts is evident in the claim."}
