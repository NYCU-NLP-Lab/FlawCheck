{"Understate": "The claim understates the current limitations and availability of diagnostic and antibody tests for the novel coronavirus. The expert's verdict highlights that there are still limitations and not enough tests for every American who wants to return to work.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by suggesting that there should be no problem for any American to have access to both diagnostic and antibody tests. The expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that the answer is quite clearly no, as there is not enough capacity to offer testing broadly.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that there should be no problem for any American to have access to both types of tests. The expert's verdict provides evidence that testing is still limited and below proposed benchmarks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that there are adequate levels of testing for the coronavirus to allow states to lift stay-at-home orders and restart businesses. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by stating that testing is still limited and not enough for every American who wants to return to work.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or acknowledge the differing opinions and estimates on the number of tests needed for the U.S. to reopen. The expert's verdict mentions that there isn't a consensus on the number of tests needed due to different assumptions and approaches taken by different groups."}
