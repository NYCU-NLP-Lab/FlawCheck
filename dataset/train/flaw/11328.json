{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Navy SEALs arrested Hillary Clinton lacks any evidence to support it. There is no credible source or verifiable information provided to back up the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hillary Clinton has been active on social media, appearing in interviews, and promoting her podcast after the alleged arrest. This contradicts the notion that she was arrested and being held in custody.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the alleged actions taken by the Navy SEALs, including firing a tranquilizer dart into Clinton's neck, taping her mouth shut, and covering her head in a black cloth bag. These details seem exaggerated and lack credibility.", "Understate": "There is no understatement bias present in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable information. It relies on an unnamed source in Donald Trump's \"orbit\" and is published on a website called Real Raw News, which is not known for its credibility. This raises doubts about the reliability of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton was arrested by Navy SEALs based on an unnamed source without providing any substantial evidence. This assumption is problematic as it lacks credibility and relies on unverified information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the claim is entirely false and unsubstantiated. The lack of media coverage, Clinton's active presence on social media, and the absence of any credible evidence suggest that the claim is baseless."}
