{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of governors who have worn blackface by stating that there are more of them than black governors. In reality, there are only two governors who have apologized for wearing blackface.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of black governors by stating that there are zero black governors. In reality, there have been two African American governors in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement about the number of governors who have worn blackface.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of governors who have worn blackface is significant enough to compare it to the number of black governors. However, without sufficient evidence, this assumption is questionable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the lack of black governors is not solely due to governors wearing blackface but could be influenced by other factors such as systemic racism or limited opportunities for black candidates."}
