{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that there are \"literally two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of Congress,\" which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that they contacted Klobuchar's campaign for confirmation of the claim's source but did not receive any further information. This lack of confirmation or additional evidence may suggest a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of pharmaceutical lobbyists directly correlates with their influence and power over Congress. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks other factors that contribute to policymaking and decision-making processes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that the number of lobbyists per member of Congress varies depending on the definition of the pharmaceutical industry. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations or interpretations of the claim, highlighting the need for further clarification or context."}
