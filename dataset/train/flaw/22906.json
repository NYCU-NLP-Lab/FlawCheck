{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Jacky Rosen openly supported Hillary Clinton during the presidential caucus in February.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is evidence from interviews and articles that Rosen openly supported Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rosen's refusal to weigh in on the presidential race means she does not support either Sanders or Clinton, without considering other reasons for her refusal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Rosen may have chosen not to publicly endorse a candidate during the presidential caucus in order to maintain neutrality in her own campaign."}
