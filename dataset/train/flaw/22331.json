{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) brought coyotes into the state to control the deer population. However, the expert's verdict states that TWRA has never been involved in any coyote relocation, suggesting that this assumption is problematic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the TWRA brought coyotes into the state for the purpose of controlling the deer population. The expert's verdict states that TWRA has never engaged in coyote relocation and that the idea is a common myth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that TWRA has never been involved in any coyote relocation, as stated by the expert's verdict. This indicates that the claim is not supported by factual information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an unsupported and contradictory statement about the TWRA's involvement in bringing coyotes into the state. The expert's verdict highlights the inconsistency in the claim and provides a more accurate explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that coyotes are not effective deer hunters, implying that the TWRA would not have brought them in to control the deer population. This challenges the claim's assumption and offers an alternative perspective."}
