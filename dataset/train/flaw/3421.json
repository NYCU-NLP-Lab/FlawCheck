{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it states that Crayola accepts boxes of \"dead markers\" for recycling at no cost to consumers, but the provided expert's verdict states that the program is only open to schools in the contiguous 48 United States and parts of Canada, and individual customers are not eligible to send their markers directly to Crayola for recycling.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that Crayola accepts boxes of \"dead markers\" for recycling at no cost to consumers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Crayola accepts all types of markers for recycling, but the expert's verdict states that the program also accepts non-Crayola markers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations or consider other possibilities for marker recycling programs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations of the program by not mentioning that it is currently on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic and that it is unknown when it will resume.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the program is not open to homeschoolers, daycares, or other institutions as of August 2017, which is stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the accessibility of the program by stating that it is open to all consumers and accepts boxes of \"dead markers\" at no cost, when in reality it is limited to schools in specific regions and does not accept markers directly from individual customers."}
