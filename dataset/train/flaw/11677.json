{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost to taxpayers, stating a loss of $750 million, when in fact the new embassy was entirely paid for by the sale of old embassy leases and other U.S. property in London.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the new embassy did not cost the U.S. taxpayer anything, as stated by the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that the new embassy is in a \"lousy location,\" as State Department officials have stated that the old location did not meet modern security standards and was overcrowded.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that selling the old embassy site and building a new one was a bad decision, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the decision to sell the old embassy site and build a new one was based on security and space considerations, rather than solely financial factors."}
