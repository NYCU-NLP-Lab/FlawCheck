Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the scientific data from high school sports levels in numerous different states can be directly applied to the situation in New York without considering potential differences in COVID-19 transmission rates, testing protocols, or other factors. This assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decision to resume high-risk sports, such as political pressure or economic considerations. It presents the scientific data as the sole reason for the decision, which may overlook other factors at play.", "Falters at times": "While the claim asserts that there is scientific data supporting the safety of high-risk sports, it does not provide specific details or counterarguments that could address potential limitations or conflicting evidence. This lack of comprehensive information may suggest that the claim falters at times.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information. It presents the assertion that it is safe to play high-risk sports based on scientific data without downplaying or minimizing the significance of this claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not exaggerate any information. It presents the assertion based on scientific data without inflating or overstating its importance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or information. It aligns with the decision made by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to allow higher risk sports to resume and the information provided by Assemblymember Colin Schmitt and other sources."}
