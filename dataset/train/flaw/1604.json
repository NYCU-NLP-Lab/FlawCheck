{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the speaker released \"way more\" tax information than Bruce Rauner, implying a significant difference in the amount of information disclosed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the speaker released more tax information than Bruce Rauner.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the release of tax information is a measure of transparency or suitability for office, without providing a clear rationale or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in tax disclosure between the speaker and Bruce Rauner, such as legal or personal considerations, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to present a clear and supported argument, as it does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to back up the assertion made."}
