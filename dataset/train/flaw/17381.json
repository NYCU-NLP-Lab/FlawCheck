{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of processed foods that contain GMOs. The expert's verdict mentions that the Grocery Manufacturers Association states that 70-80 percent of all foods we consume contain genetically modified ingredients, not just processed foods. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the prevalence of GMOs in processed foods.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of GMOs in processed foods is a problem or something to be concerned about. The expert's verdict mentions that there is little solid evidence to suggest that GMO foods pose a greater risk to consumers than non-modified counterparts, as noted by major scientific organizations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the claim that roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain GMOs. The expert's verdict mentions that the Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, stated in 2007 that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual GMOs, but it does not provide more recent or comprehensive data to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that GMO foods typically do not contain organisms themselves but are derived from genetically modified organisms. This distinction is important in evaluating the claim, as it may lead to alternative explanations or interpretations of the claim's statement about the presence of GMOs in processed foods."}
