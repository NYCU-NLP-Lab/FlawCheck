{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the threat posed by Iran's regime by stating that they declare war on the United States \"every Friday.\" While there are instances of anti-American rhetoric in Iran, it is unlikely that they declare war every week.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Iran's regime declares war on the United States every Friday.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the chants of \"Death to America\" during Friday prayers in Iran equate to a declaration of war, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the chants of \"Death to America\" during Friday prayers may be the basis for the claim, but it is possible that these chants are more symbolic or rhetorical rather than a literal declaration of war."}
