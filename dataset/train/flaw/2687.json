{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the norm for presidential candidates to release 10 or 11 years of tax returns, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that candidates have released fewer years in the past.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of tax returns typically released by presidential candidates, as the expert's verdict provides examples of candidates releasing more than 10 or 11 years of tax returns.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that it is \"typical\" for candidates to release 10 or 11 years of tax returns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the alternative explanation that the number of tax returns released by candidates may vary and is not necessarily consistent across all candidates."}
