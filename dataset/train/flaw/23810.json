{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the danger posed by Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) by stating that it could cause catastrophic danger to Earth. The expert's verdict clarifies that the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet and poses no immediate threat.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that NASA warned about the asteroid hitting Earth in April 2020. The expert's verdict explains that NASA has been monitoring the asteroid for over two decades and provides information about its size, speed, and closest approach to Earth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that NASA's warning about the asteroid hitting Earth is accurate and reliable. The expert's verdict highlights that NASA did not issue a \"warning\" about a possible catastrophic collision and that the asteroid is not listed as a potential future Earth impact event.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the possibility of the asteroid hitting Earth as the only outcome, without considering alternative scenarios. The expert's verdict emphasizes that the asteroid is expected to safely pass Earth and poses no immediate danger.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual distance between the asteroid and Earth, stating that it could hit Earth without providing the accurate distance. The expert's verdict clarifies that the asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth, which is about 16 times the distance between Earth and the moon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that NASA did not issue a warning about the asteroid hitting Earth. The expert's verdict states that NASA did not issue a \"warning\" and clarifies the actual information available about the asteroid.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information."}
