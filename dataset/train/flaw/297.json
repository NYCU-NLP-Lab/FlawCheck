{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Congressman Jack Kingston's record on raising his own pay, as it states that he voted to raise it seven times, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples of the seven times Kingston allegedly voted to raise his pay.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that voting to limit pay increases is the same as voting to raise pay, which is not necessarily true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided that Perdue's claim is based on procedural votes rather than actual votes to raise pay, suggesting that the claim may be misleading."}
