{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the policy of the Bush administration was not to add new nuclear capabilities contradicts the fact that the Bush administration proposed developing a nuclear \"bunker-buster\" weapon and talked about the need to develop weapons for \"hard and deeply-buried targets.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the Bush administration did not add new nuclear capabilities, as they did propose developing new weapons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that the Bush administration did not add new nuclear capabilities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the policy of the Bush administration was consistent throughout its tenure, without considering any potential changes or shifts in policy over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as the claim does not take into account the initial plans and proposals made by the Bush administration for developing new nuclear weapons."}
