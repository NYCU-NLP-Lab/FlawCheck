{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that there are \"at least 6 million workers\" being paid below the national minimum wage level.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the introduction of the national minimum wage will automatically improve the wages of 6 million workers. However, it does not consider potential challenges or limitations in implementing the policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why workers are being paid below the national minimum wage level, such as economic factors or employer practices.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it does not provide a clear explanation of how the national minimum wage will directly improve the wages of 6 million workers.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of workers being paid below the national minimum wage level if the actual number is higher than 6 million.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the number of workers being paid below the national minimum wage level."}
