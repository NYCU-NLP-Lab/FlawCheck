{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the story of a cow and leopard cuddling during lockdown in Assam. The only evidence provided is viral photographs and a story shared on social media, which may not be reliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs and story shared on social media are accurate and true without verifying their authenticity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident actually took place in Gujarat in 2002, not in Assam during the lockdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation to the viral story by quoting a conservator of forests who suggests that the leopard's behavior may have been modified due to living in a rural area rather than a strictly wild environment.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information about the location of the incident and the authenticity of the story."}
