{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the raid by stating that it was a \"Huge stash of assault rifles (grenade launchers in center!)\".", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that there was no news coverage of the raid on the Arizona border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of news coverage indicates a deliberate omission or conspiracy, without considering other possible reasons for the lack of coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the photos in the email actually came from a 2010 raid elsewhere in Mexico, not the Arizona border raid claimed in the email."}
