{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates President Trump's involvement in the awarding of the $100 million grant to Flint, Michigan. While some conservative outlets credited \"Trump's EPA\" for the grant, the funding was actually provided for under legislation signed by President Obama before he left office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between President Trump and the awarding of the grant. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the grant was funded by legislation signed by President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the grant was awarded solely at the behest of President Trump, without considering the role of previous legislation and the EPA's decision-making process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that both President Trump and President Obama can be credited to some extent for the grant. This indicates that there is an alternative explanation to the claim's assertion that President Trump was solely responsible for the award."}
