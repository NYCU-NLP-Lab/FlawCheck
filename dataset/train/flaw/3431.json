{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not take into account inflation, which significantly affects the comparison between funding and enrollment growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that K-12 funding growing six times faster than enrollment is a significant issue or problem. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated in the claim itself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the claim made by Gov. Bob McDonnell is partially valid but out of context. This implies that there may be alternative explanations or factors that need to be considered when interpreting the claim."}
