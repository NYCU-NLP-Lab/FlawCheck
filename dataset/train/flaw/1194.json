{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote solely due to the photo identification requirement. This assumption is problematic because there could be other factors contributing to lower voter turnout.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the estimate of 200,000 people being denied or chilled in their voting efforts. The evidence provided refers to a report commissioned by a political action committee and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all possible factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the lower voter turnout in Wisconsin, such as a lack of enthusiasm for the candidates or a belief that Trump couldn't win the state. This alternative explanation suggests that the photo identification requirement may not be the sole factor affecting voter turnout.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of the photo identification requirement by only focusing on the estimate of 200,000 people. It is possible that the actual number of affected voters could be higher.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 2016 presidential election was the first in Wisconsin where a photo identification was required to vote. This contradicts the claim's implication that the photo identification requirement was solely responsible for voter suppression in the state.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the photo identification requirement by attributing all of the lower voter turnout in Wisconsin to the law. The evidence provided does not thoroughly analyze other potential factors contributing to lower turnout."}
