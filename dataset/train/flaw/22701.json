{"Understates": "The claim may understate the evidence by not providing a direct quote or specific mention from Rick Scott where he explicitly states that education is not a \"core function\" of the state. The expert's verdict mentions that Scott talked about the core functions of government in a general way, suggesting that the claim may be an understatement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rick Scott called education not a \"core function\" of the state based on Democrats pointing to a quote where Scott talked about returning to the \"core functions\" of the state while also cutting education. However, the expert's verdict states that there is no specific mention of education being not a \"core function\" of government, suggesting that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough direct evidence or support to conclusively prove that Rick Scott called education not a \"core function\" of the state. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no specific mention of education as not a \"core function\" by Scott, indicating that the claim may lack sufficient support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Scott's statement about returning to the \"core functions\" of the state. The expert's verdict mentions that Scott talked about core functions in a general way, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for his statement."}
