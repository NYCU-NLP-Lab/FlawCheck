{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Trump's tax cuts on economic growth by stating that they \"spur economic growth,\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that corporate taxes were actually down by 28.5 percent during the first 10 months of the fiscal year, which contradicts the notion that tax cuts led to a record tax haul.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the tax cuts directly resulted in the record tax haul. The provided evidence only shows a modest increase in total receipts, which could be attributed to other factors such as population and economic growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in tax receipts is solely due to the tax cuts and the resulting economic growth, without considering other possible explanations or factors that could have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in tax haul, such as population growth and the overall growth of the economy, which could have contributed to the higher tax receipts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that corporate taxes were actually down by a significant percentage during the first 10 months of the fiscal year, which challenges the assertion that the tax cuts led to a record tax haul.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of factors other than the tax cuts on the record tax haul, such as population growth and overall economic growth, which could have played a significant role in the increase in tax receipts."}
