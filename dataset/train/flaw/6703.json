{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Stephen Zappala is \"the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide.\" This implies that no other district attorney in the state has ever convicted an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide, which may not be true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that Stephen Zappala is the only district attorney in the state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide. There is no evidence provided to show that no other district attorney has achieved such a conviction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that convicting an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide is a significant accomplishment or a measure of being tough on cops. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks other factors and actions that can demonstrate toughness on law enforcement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other district attorneys may have convicted on-duty police officers of criminal homicide, but the information is not widely known or publicized. There could be alternative explanations for why this claim is being made, such as political motives or campaign strategies."}
