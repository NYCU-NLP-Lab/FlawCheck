It only mentions the percentages without providing further context or explanation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the allocation of stimulus funds to districts is based on partisan affiliation, implying potential corruption or partisanship. However, it does not provide evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the disparity in stimulus funds, such as differences in population, economic conditions, or specific project needs in each district.
