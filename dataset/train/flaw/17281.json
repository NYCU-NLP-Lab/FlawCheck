{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the behavior of President Ramaphosa by stating that he is \"dancing like he's on drugs.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that the image in question is slightly blurred, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that President Ramaphosa is dancing like he's on drugs. The expert's verdict mentions that the image in question was taken during a visit to an informal settlement and that the woman's image is more clearly defined than the rest of the people in the picture. However, there is no direct evidence or support for the claim itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Ramaphosa's dancing behavior is indicative of being on drugs. This assumption is not supported by any factual evidence or expert analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that President Ramaphosa was testing a bed made by artisans on the side of the road during his visit to an informal settlement. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that he is dancing like he's on drugs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image in question was taken during a visit to an informal settlement and that President Ramaphosa was testing a bed made by artisans. The claim's assertion that he is dancing like he's on drugs does not align with the factual information provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making an unsubstantiated and exaggerated statement about President Ramaphosa's behavior without providing sufficient evidence or support."}
