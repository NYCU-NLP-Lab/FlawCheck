{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Sen. Bill Nelson \"hasn't done anything\" on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control, when there is evidence of his support for related legislation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are multiple examples of legislation that Sen. Nelson has supported related to gun control and school safety.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by assuming that Sen. Nelson's lack of action on gun safety or school safety means he hasn't done anything on those issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as Sen. Nelson has supported an assault weapons ban, sponsored bills related to gun safety, and voted in favor of measures on gun control."}
