{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which dogs can show jealousy based on the study's findings. The study suggests that dogs engage in behaviors that appear to be jealous, but it does not provide conclusive evidence of their subjective experience of jealousy.", "Lack enough support": "The study mentioned in the claim has been criticized for not measuring the dogs' reactions to the stuffed animal or the pail without their owners present. This lack of additional data weakens the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the behaviors observed in the study indicate jealousy in dogs. However, the study does not definitively prove that the dogs were motivated by jealousy rather than other factors such as fear or possessiveness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The study's director, Laurie Santos, suggests an alternative explanation for the observed behaviors, questioning whether the dogs were reacting out of fear rather than jealousy. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of dogs showing jealousy.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of the study's findings, as it does not mention the criticism or alternative explanations raised by experts. This omission can create a biased perception of the study's conclusions.", "Contradict fact": "There is no contradiction of fact in the claim or the provided information.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or downplay the significance of the study's findings."}
