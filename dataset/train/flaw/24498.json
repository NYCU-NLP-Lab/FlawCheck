{"Lack enough support": "The claim of there being \"273 mass shootings in the United States so far in 2017\" lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all incidents involving four or more people shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, should be classified as mass shootings. However, there are different definitions and criteria for what constitutes a mass shooting, leading to varying counts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the number discrepancy, as different organizations and sources may use different criteria and definitions for counting mass shootings. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual number of mass shootings in the United States in 2017 if other definitions or criteria are used. The claim assumes that the provided number is accurate and comprehensive.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are different counts and definitions of mass shootings. The claim presents a specific number without acknowledging the variations and discrepancies in counting methods.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the number of mass shootings in the United States in 2017 if the provided count is not accurate or if the criteria used for counting is broader than commonly accepted definitions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing specific evidence or data to support the number of mass shootings stated. It relies on general statements and quotes without presenting a comprehensive analysis or research."}
