{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the makers of Dettol knew about the coronavirus in 2019 lacks sufficient evidence or support. The provided evidence only shows that Dettol claims to kill various viruses, including \"Human Coronavirus,\" but it does not specifically mention the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan in December 2019.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mention of \"Human Coronavirus\" on the Dettol label refers to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, the expert's verdict clarifies that \"coronavirus\" is a general term for a family of viruses that includes the common cold and more serious viruses like MERS, SARS, and the novel coronavirus. Therefore, assuming that the mention on the label refers to the specific novel coronavirus is problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Reckitt Benkiser, the company behind Dettol, stated that they had not yet tested their products on the novel coronavirus and could not confirm its effectiveness. This contradicts the claim that the makers of Dettol knew about the coronavirus in 2019.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim understates any information or facts.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim exaggerates any information or facts.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim falters at times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict is that the mention of \"Human Coronavirus\" on the Dettol label refers to a general category of coronaviruses, including the common cold, rather than specifically referring to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assumption that Dettol knew about the specific novel coronavirus in 2019."}
