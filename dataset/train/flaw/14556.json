{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of pregnant women who receive abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim assumes pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of three options (abortion, adoption, or prenatal care), which may not be accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of pregnant women who visit Planned Parenthood clinics receive abortions. However, this assumption may not be supported by sufficient evidence or may overlook other reasons why pregnant women seek services at Planned Parenthood.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that 32 out of 33 pregnant women receive an abortion at Planned Parenthood clinics. The expert's verdict mentions that the sources provided by Rep. Jean Schmidt, who made the claim, are anti-abortion organizations, and their information is derived from a fact sheet from Planned Parenthood. The calculation used by these organizations may not accurately represent the full range of services provided by Planned Parenthood.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that Planned Parenthood steers pregnant women into getting abortions. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Democrats portrayed Planned Parenthood clinics as a major provider of various health services to low-income women. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for why pregnant women visit Planned Parenthood clinics, other than being directed towards getting an abortion.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive understanding of the services provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim focuses solely on the percentage of abortions performed by Planned Parenthood, neglecting other services such as adoption referrals and prenatal care.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
