{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of major attacks in the United States since 9/11. The actual number is 85, but the claim presents it as a larger problem than it is.", "Understate": "The claim understates the percentage of attacks committed by white supremacists. The claim states that 73 percent of the attacks were by white nationalist hate groups, but the actual figure is around 45 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that 73 percent of the attacks were by white nationalist hate groups. The data from the GAO report does not directly support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all far-right extremist groups are white nationalist hate groups, which is not entirely accurate. Far-right extremist groups encompass various ideologies and motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the attacks or take into account other sources that may have labeled perpetrators as white supremacists or held racist views."}
