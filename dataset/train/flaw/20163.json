{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by stating that graduation rates of players at major football colleges are \"still twenty points below their male campus peers.\" This suggests that the gap has not improved over time and may downplay the severity of the issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that graduation rates have worsened in the past three years. Without sufficient supporting evidence, the claim may lack enough support to be considered reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graduation rates of players at major football colleges should be on par with their male campus peers. This assumption may be problematic as there could be various factors influencing the difference in graduation rates, such as the demands of being a student-athlete.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the lower graduation rates of players at major football colleges. Other factors, such as academic support systems or the prioritization of athletic success over academic success, could contribute to this disparity."}
