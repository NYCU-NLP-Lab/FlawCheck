The expert's verdict does not provide evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that a majority of Americans have voted for a party with this intention. The expert's verdict does not provide any data or statistics on voting patterns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the rule change, stating that it is meant to be inclusive of all members and their families, including those who are nonbinary. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the intention is to eliminate traditional familial terms."}
