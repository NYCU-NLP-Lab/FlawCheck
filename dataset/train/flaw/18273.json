{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Eric Holder and his group made the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \"highly partisan.\" While their involvement did add a national partisan dimension to the race, it is not clear if they were solely responsible for making it highly partisan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Eric Holder and his group were the primary cause of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race becoming highly partisan. However, it fails to consider the role of the Wisconsin Republican Party in backing the opposing candidate and contributing to the partisanship.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Eric Holder and his group made the Wisconsin Supreme Court race highly partisan. It does mention Holder's involvement and the financial support provided, but it does not provide comprehensive evidence to establish a direct causal link.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the existence of alternative explanations for the high partisanship in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. It solely focuses on Holder and his group's involvement, disregarding other potential factors that may have contributed to the partisanship.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan. While it acknowledges that it \"boiled down to a ballot test between parties,\" it fails to address the contradiction between the nonpartisan nature of the race and the claim of high partisanship."}
