{"Lack enough support": "The claim of EVM tampering in Bihar elections registers votes for BJP is not supported by sufficient evidence or proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of a person casting their vote on an EVM proves that votes cast for any party were getting registered in favor of the BJP. However, this assumption is not substantiated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video shows the person's hand placed over both the BJP and BSP symbols on the EVM, which suggests that the person may have intentionally voted for the BJP. This alternative explanation challenges the claim of EVM tampering.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis of the video using InVID and finding that it was shared with Punjabi text in May 2019 during Lok Sabha elections contradicts the claim of EVM tampering in the Bihar elections.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and security measures in place for EVMs, as well as the rigorous testing and monitoring conducted by the Election Commission to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of EVM tampering by suggesting that it could affect the outcome of the entire Bihar election.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and convincing argument or evidence to support the allegation of EVM tampering."}
