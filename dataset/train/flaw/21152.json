{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the UK's universal healthcare system is \"going broke and not working.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim gives a misleading impression about the British public's opinion on the healthcare system and its funding situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the UK's universal healthcare system is failing. The expert's verdict provides polling statistics and expert opinions that contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for the NHS march is that the system is going broke and not working. However, the expert's verdict explains that the march was organized by the People's Assembly as a campaign against austerity, and not solely due to the system's financial issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the NHS march, such as the opposition to funding cuts or concerns about the quality of care. The expert's verdict provides additional context and reasons for the march, which differ from the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that public support for the NHS remains high and that the system is still valued by the British public. The expert's verdict presents polling data and expert opinions that counter the claim's assertion."}
