{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the health care law on small businesses by stating that it \"crushes\" them with billions in penalties.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that small businesses are actually being crushed with billions in penalties.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new health care law is solely responsible for penalties imposed on small businesses, without considering other factors or regulations that may contribute to such penalties.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for any penalties faced by small businesses, such as non-compliance with existing regulations or market factors unrelated to the health care law."}
