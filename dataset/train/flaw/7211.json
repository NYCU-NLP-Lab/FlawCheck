{"Exaggerate": "The claim is exaggerated in the English-speaking press, where it is puffed up into alarming claims about how hackers can steal identities by zooming in on fingerprints.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the original article from Shankei Shimbun does not explicitly mention the potential for hackers to steal identities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that hackers can extract fingerprints from peace sign selfies and steal people's identities without providing sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict that the original articles were less about the dangers of identity theft using fingerprints and more about the efforts to develop technology that could potentially prevent such theft in the future."}
