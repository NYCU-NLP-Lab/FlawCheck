{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Rubio's position on President Obama's illegal executive action by stating that he promised not to rescind it on the first day in office. The provided evidence suggests that Rubio did express support for DACA but also stated that it would have to ultimately end.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rubio's support for DACA implies support for President Obama's illegal executive action. However, the evidence provided does not directly address the legality of the action or Rubio's stance on it.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided consists of statements made by Cruz and Rubio, as well as articles from Breitbart and responses from their campaigns. While these sources provide some insight into the issue, they may not provide enough comprehensive support to fully evaluate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that Rubio's statements on Univision indicate his support for President Obama's illegal executive action. However, an alternative explanation could be that Rubio supports DACA but also believes it should ultimately end, which may not align with the characterization of the action as illegal."}
