{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claims about the number of women who died from cervical cancer in 2008 cannot be proven and the data from 2012 is incorrect. This suggests a lack of enough support for these specific claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict states that Nzelu's identification of a spike in cases in 2018 is unproven due to a lack of older data and changes in reporting methods. This suggests a problematic assumption in making conclusions about the spike in cases without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Nigeria has stopped mass screenings for cervical cancer due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the increase in cervical cancer cases, which could be related to the disruption of screening activities rather than solely the pandemic itself.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the claim about cervical cancer being the second-most common cause of cancer deaths in Nigerian women is correct, but it contradicts the claim that it is the third-most common cancer in Nigeria overall. This indicates a contradiction in the presented information.", "Understate": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, but if the claim is indeed accurate that there was a spike in cervical cancer deaths in 2018, then the expert's verdict could potentially understate the severity of the situation by suggesting that it is unproven due to lack of data.", "Exaggerate": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, but if the claim is inaccurate or unsupported, then it could potentially be an exaggeration of the actual number of cervical cancer deaths in 2018.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that some of the claims made by Nzelu cannot be proven or are incorrect, indicating that the claim falters at times in terms of accuracy and reliability."}
