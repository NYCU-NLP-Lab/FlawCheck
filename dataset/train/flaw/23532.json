{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Wisconsin is the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children, regardless of age, at bars and restaurants. The expert's verdict mentions that establishments can decline to serve parent-accompanied minors, suggesting that not all establishments in Wisconsin may allow this practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Wisconsin is the only state with this policy. The expert's verdict also mentions that the group provided state and national research on alcohol-control laws, but it is not clear if this research specifically supports the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children at bars and restaurants contributes to an unsafe drinking culture and impaired brain development associated with early-age drinking. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other factors that may contribute to alcohol abuse or the potential benefits of teaching responsible drinking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Wisconsin's high binge-drinking rates, such as cultural or social factors. The expert's verdict mentions that Wisconsin has been ranked as the nation's top binge-drinking state, but it does not explore other possible reasons for this ranking.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of facts in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the uniqueness of Wisconsin's policy by stating that it is the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children at bars and restaurants, regardless of age. The expert's verdict mentions that establishments can choose not to serve parent-accompanied minors, suggesting that this practice may not be as widespread as the claim implies.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence that the claim falters at times in terms of presenting accurate information or arguments."}
