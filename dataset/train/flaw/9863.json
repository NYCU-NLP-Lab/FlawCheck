{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of Hillary Clinton in putting together the sanctions against Iran. While she played a significant role, it is possible that other individuals and departments were also involved in the process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or details to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran. It would be helpful to provide more information or sources to validate this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sanctions were solely responsible for forcing Iran to the negotiating table. It does not consider other factors or actors that may have influenced Iran's decision to negotiate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Iran coming to the negotiating table, such as internal political dynamics in Iran, international pressure from multiple countries, or other diplomatic efforts by various actors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of other countries and international organizations in imposing sanctions on Iran. While the claim focuses on Clinton's role, it is important to acknowledge the collective efforts of multiple countries and entities in implementing and enforcing the sanctions.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive timeline or clear evidence of Clinton's involvement in the entire process. It is unclear if her role extended beyond the initial 18 months mentioned.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of facts in the claim as presented. However, without additional evidence or details, it is challenging to fully assess the accuracy of the claim."}
