{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the positions of both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on abortion by stating that they both seek an abortion \"cutoff date\" of 36 weeks and claim that late-stage fetuses feel no pain and have no rights. The expert's verdict clarifies that neither candidate specifically sought to legalize all elective abortions up to 36 weeks, and neither candidate made the claim that fetuses don't feel pain or have rights.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statements made about Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton's positions on abortion. The expert's verdict provides additional information and sources to support their assessment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have identical plans for abortions in the United States, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is vague and misleading and that the positions of the candidates are not as stated in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the positions of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on abortion. The expert's verdict provides additional context and information about their positions, including Clinton's indication that she would agree with late-term abortion bans if provisions were included for the health of the mother."}
