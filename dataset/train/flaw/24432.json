{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that the photograph showing Bernie Sanders at the civil rights march does bear a resemblance to him, but that similarity alone is not sufficient to confirm his participation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph indeed shows Bernie Sanders at the 1965 civil rights march, but the expert's verdict questions this assumption and highlights the lack of evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the man in the photograph may not be Bernie Sanders, as there is no mention of him in the caption provided by the licenser of the photograph. This implies that there could be an alternative explanation for the identity of the person in the picture."}
