{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Nike released a line of sneakers designed to look burned in retaliation against consumers who destroyed their products in protest. The provided information only mentions a viral Facebook post and a photograph of custom sneakers, which were unrelated to the protests against Nike.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nike released the burned sneakers as a response to the protests, without any concrete evidence to support this assumption. It is based on an incorrect association between the viral photograph and the protests against Nike.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the custom sneakers featured in the photograph were created by an artist, Kelsey Amy, for customers who requested grilling-inspired sneakers. The association of these sneakers with the protests against Nike is incorrect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph does not depict an official product offered by Nike. It is a custom creation by an artist and was not released by Nike as a response to the protests.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of any exaggeration bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of any faltering bias in the claim."}
