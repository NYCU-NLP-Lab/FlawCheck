{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that people who die during mass shootings don't believe in God enough. The claim is based on a viral meme that was not actually made by Tomi Lahren or posted on any official platforms associated with her.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason people die during mass shootings is due to a lack of belief in God. This assumption is not supported by any factual evidence and is based on a distorted interpretation of Lahren's actual statements about the need for prayer.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the quote attributed to Tomi Lahren is not genuine. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is a misrepresentation and was created by someone else.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Lahren's stance on the role of prayer in preventing mass shootings. While Lahren did express the belief that more prayer is needed, she did not make the extreme statement that people who die in mass shootings lack belief in God.", "Understate": "N/A", "Falters at times": "N/A", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why people die during mass shootings, such as the presence of firearms, mental health issues, or inadequate security measures. It simplifies the complex factors involved in these tragic events."}
