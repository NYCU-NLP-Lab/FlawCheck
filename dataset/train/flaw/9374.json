{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of students from New Jersey who leave their home state to be educated. The expert's verdict states that the claim is not accurate and provides statistics that show a much larger number of students nationwide pursuing education at out-of-state institutions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement that \"about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated.\" The expert's verdict also points out the lack of accuracy in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high number of New Jersey students leaving the state for education is due to a lack of capacity in in-state schools. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there may be other factors contributing to this phenomenon, such as a brain drain disproportionately happening in New Jersey.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the high number of New Jersey students leaving the state for education, such as a brain drain. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assumption of a lack of capacity in in-state schools as the sole reason for the exodus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are far more than 100,000 students nationwide pursuing a postsecondary education at an out-of-state institution, as stated by the expert's verdict. The claim's statement that \"Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount\" is not supported by the evidence.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
