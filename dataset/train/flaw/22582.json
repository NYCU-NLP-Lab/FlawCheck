{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated by implying that Romney explicitly said \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to take a shot at Osama bin Laden, when in reality he criticized Obama for suggesting an attack \"without Pakistani approval.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's criticism of Obama's stance on attacking inside Pakistan without Pakistani approval equates to him saying \"we should ask Pakistan for permission.\" This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies Romney's position.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively conclude that Romney said \"we should ask Pakistan for permission.\" The evidence provided suggests that Romney criticized Obama for his stance on attacking inside Pakistan, but does not explicitly state that he advocated for asking Pakistan for permission.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists in the fact that Romney's criticism of Obama's position may have been focused on the lack of collaboration with other nations rather than specifically asking Pakistan for permission. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may be oversimplifying Romney's stance."}
