{"Exaggerate": "The claim of the expansion of Wisconsin's school voucher program costing nearly $2 billion annually may be an exaggeration, as it is based on an estimate from the state Department of Public Instruction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only references a statement from the state Department of Public Instruction and an email from the state Superintendent of Public Instruction, both of which may be biased against the voucher program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the expansion of the voucher program would lead to a significant increase in costs, without providing evidence or considering alternative factors that could impact the cost.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the estimated cost of the voucher program expansion, such as the inclusion of potential future costs or the assumption that enrollment caps are temporary."}
