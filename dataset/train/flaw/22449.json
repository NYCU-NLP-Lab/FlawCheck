{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the support for universal basic income by stating that Thomas Paine and Martin Luther King Jr. were both champions of it, without providing enough context or evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that universal basic income passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971. More evidence or references are needed to confirm this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that universal basic income is a \"deeply American idea\" dating back centuries, without providing enough historical context or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding universal basic income, presenting it as a positive and unquestionable solution without considering potential drawbacks or criticisms."}
