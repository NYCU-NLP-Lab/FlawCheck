{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photographer was crying after Dhoni was run out in the world cup semi-finals against New Zealand. The evidence provided suggests that the image is from a different event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crying photographer is related to Dhoni's run out in the world cup semi-finals, without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image is actually from a different event, the Asian Cup in January 2019, where an Iraqi photographer was seen crying after his country lost against Qatar.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the emotional impact of the image by suggesting that it represents the photographer's reaction to Dhoni's run out, when in fact it is from a different event.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the image is not related to Dhoni's run out but is from a different event, as confirmed by various articles and social media posts."}
