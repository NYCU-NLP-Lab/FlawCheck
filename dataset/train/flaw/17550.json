{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Californians who turned down jury duty due to not being citizens. The actual number is much lower than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 449,000 noncitizens who were registered voters turned down jury duty.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 449,000 disqualified individuals were registered voters, which is not supported by the available data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the disqualified individuals may have been disqualified for reasons other than not being citizens, such as age, felony convictions, or other disqualifying factors.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the jury duty process, as individuals can be excused or disqualified for various reasons beyond citizenship status.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the California Secretary of State's office has stated that it's not true that 449,000 noncitizens were registered to vote.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by inaccurately stating that individuals \"turn down\" jury duty, whereas they can be excused or disqualified by the court."}
