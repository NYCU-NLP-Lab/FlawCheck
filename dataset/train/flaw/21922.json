{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to verify the existence of a new Boeing 797 blended-wing airliner.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the provided photograph represents a new Boeing 797 blended-wing airliner, but there is no evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that Boeing is not currently developing a blended-wing aircraft for commercial use and that the image does not represent any aircraft designed or produced by Boeing.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and research involved in developing a new blended-wing airliner by simply stating it as a fact without providing any supporting evidence or context.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of a new Boeing 797 blended-wing airliner by stating that it could reshape the air travel industry for the next 100 years without providing sufficient evidence or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the photograph, such as it being a concept or a representation of a potential future aircraft design, rather than an actual aircraft currently being developed by Boeing."}
