{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the Nigerian military is attacking ESN members in Orlu, without providing sufficient evidence or proof of such an attack.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a photo and a caption from a Facebook account known for promoting the activities of a separatist movement, without any additional credible sources or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of a helicopter posted by a Facebook account is evidence of the Nigerian military attacking ESN members in Orlu, without verifying the authenticity of the claim or the source of the image.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image being circulated as part of the military operation in Orlu was actually taken near the capital Abuja three years ago, during a different military demonstration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the image, as it was originally published in a Nigerian daily newspaper in 2018, depicting military airstrikes against Boko Haram, not the Nigerian military attacking ESN members in Orlu."}
