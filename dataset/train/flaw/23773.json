{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of President Obama leaving early on the air show, as it suggests that the entire show was held up because of his departure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on an anonymous account and a single individual's observation, which may not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that President Obama's departure caused a delay in the air show.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's departure was the sole reason for the air show being held up, without considering other possible factors that could have contributed to the delay.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the delay in the air show, such as technical difficulties or other logistical issues, which are not considered in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama praised the graduates and participated in the graduation ceremony, suggesting that he left early without any valid reason."}
