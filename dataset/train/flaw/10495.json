{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the comparison between the fictional weather map from 2050 and the real weather map from June 2019. The expert's verdict mentions that the fictional weather reports were created in 2014, but it doesn't provide any specific details or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fictional weather map from 2050 accurately represents the future climate conditions and that the real weather map from June 2019 is a reflection of those predictions. However, the expert's verdict only mentions that the temperatures in the June 2019 heat wave were within the realm of possibility, without providing any direct correlation between the two maps.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the similarities between the fictional weather map from 2050 and the real weather map from June 2019. The expert's verdict mentions that the temperatures in the June 2019 heat wave were similar to those depicted in the fictional weather reports, but it doesn't explore other factors that could have contributed to the similarities, such as natural climate variability or coincidental weather patterns.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict provides some information about the origin of the fictional weather reports and the viral image comparison, but it falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the claim. It doesn't thoroughly examine the accuracy or reliability of the comparison, nor does it address any potential biases or limitations in the data or methodology used to create the fictional weather map from 2050.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the potential exaggeration or sensationalism surrounding the claim. While it mentions that the temperatures in the June 2019 heat wave were within the realm of possibility, it doesn't provide a clear assessment of whether the comparison between the fictional weather map from 2050 and the real weather map from June 2019 accurately represents the predicted climate conditions.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of facts in the claim or the expert's verdict. Both acknowledge the existence of the fictional weather map from 2050 and the real weather map from June 2019, but the accuracy and validity of the comparison between the two maps are questionable."}
