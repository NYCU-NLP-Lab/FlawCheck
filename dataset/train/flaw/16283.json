{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Governor-elect Scott Walker's opposition to high-speed rail \"killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs\" could be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that all of those jobs would have been lost solely due to his opposition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim relies on the assumption that all the projected jobs mentioned in the report by the WISPIRG Foundation would have actually materialized.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that 13,000 jobs would have been lost. The evidence provided is based on projections and assumptions rather than concrete data.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict indicates that Governor-elect Scott Walker's opposition to the high-speed rail prematurely declared the proposal dead, suggesting that the claim may falter in accurately attributing the job losses solely to his opposition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential loss of jobs, such as changes in economic conditions or other factors beyond Governor-elect Scott Walker's control."}
