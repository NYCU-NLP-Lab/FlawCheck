{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which fast food workers rely on public assistance by stating that \"most\" of them are on some form of public assistance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that most fast food workers are on public assistance. The evidence provided is based on a study funded by a group that supports raising the minimum wage, which could introduce bias.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason fast food workers are on public assistance is solely due to low wages, without considering other factors that could contribute to their need for assistance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why fast food workers may be on public assistance, such as lack of access to affordable healthcare or education.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the median income for fast food jobs is $8.69 an hour, suggesting that the majority of fast food workers are not earning enough to support themselves without public assistance."}
