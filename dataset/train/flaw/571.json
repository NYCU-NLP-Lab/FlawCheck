{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that John Cornyn \"dodged\" the draft during the Vietnam War, implying intentional evasion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that John Cornyn's decision to go to college instead of serving in the military was a form of draft dodging.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or documentation to support the accusation of draft dodging by John Cornyn.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that John Cornyn's student deferment was a legitimate and legal way to avoid military service during that time period."}
