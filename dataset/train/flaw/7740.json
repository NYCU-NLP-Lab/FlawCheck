However, the expert suggests that this assumption may be problematic given the potential for tax savings through corporate tax \"inversion.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert presents an alternative explanation, mentioning that the merger could be driven by tax considerations rather than solely for global growth. This suggests that the claim may not fully acknowledge or consider alternative explanations for the merger."}
