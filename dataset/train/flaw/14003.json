Exaggerate: The claim states that there are \"500 million Internet users\" and \"80 million bloggers who are driving discussions in China.\" This could be an exaggeration as there might not be concrete evidence or data to support these exact numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim mentions that \"a lot of people\" are voicing frustration and discontent. However, it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support this statement. The claim lacks specific examples or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the frustration and discontent voiced by the bloggers are representative of the entire population of Internet users in China.
