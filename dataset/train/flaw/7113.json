{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"over 1 million signatures\" were submitted to recall Gov. Scott Walker. However, the actual number of signatures submitted was 931,042, which is less than 1 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that \"over 1 million signatures\" were submitted. It relies on the Democratic Party's announcement without verifying the actual number of valid signatures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the signatures submitted are valid without considering the possibility of duplicates, illegible, or fake signatures. The actual number of valid signatures is still being reviewed by the Government Accountability Board.", "Falters at times": "The claim initially presents the figure of \"over 1 million signatures\" as a fact, but later, when questioned about the discrepancy, the Democratic Party spokesperson backtracks and calls it an estimate. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the difference between the announced number of signatures and the actual count by the elections board could be due to errors or discrepancies in the way the signatures were counted."}
