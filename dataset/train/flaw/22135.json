{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the dropout rate by stating it as \"staggering\" and \"almost 61 percent.\" The expert's analysis shows that the dropout rate is calculated based only on black males compared to white males, which may not be representative of the overall dropout rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the dropout rate mentioned. The evidence provided by Moise's campaign is based on a report about black males and education, which may not accurately reflect the overall dropout rate for the entire congressional district.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the dropout rate is solely responsible for the district \"going in the wrong direction\" without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the issues mentioned, such as crime rates or unemployment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to mention or acknowledge the efforts made by Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal, who founded a dropout prevention program. This alternative explanation suggests that there are ongoing initiatives to address the dropout issue in the district.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Frederica Wilson has been actively involved in addressing the dropout issue through her dropout prevention program. By solely attributing the dropout rate to the district without mentioning Wilson's efforts, the claim contradicts this fact.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the dropout rate by only considering the rates for black males compared to white males. This narrow focus may lead to an incomplete understanding of the dropout situation in the district.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement bias in the claim or expert's analysis."}
