{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that 17 million American children were \"uninsurable\" due to pre-existing conditions when the Affordable Care Act was signed. This number may be inflated or not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the accuracy of the statement. The evidence provided by Senator Tammy Baldwin's staff is not conclusive and does not provide specific data or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 17 million children with pre-existing conditions were completely uninsurable, without considering potential alternative options or coverage available to them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the number of children with pre-existing conditions who were considered uninsurable. Factors such as specific insurance policies, coverage limitations, or individual circumstances could contribute to the perceived lack of insurability."}
