{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the state did not estimate the percentage of single and childless adults who would benefit from expanding Medicaid.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that 85% of the expansion would be for single, childless adults, but the actual estimate is 82% and it is unclear how many of that group would be single and childless.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that childless adults currently cannot receive Medicaid under any circumstances in Florida, and the expansion would change that.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the percentage of childless adults who could get Medicaid coverage under an expansion is not known, as stated by the state's chief economist."}
