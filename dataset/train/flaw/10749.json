{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Kansans who lost their health insurance due to Obamacare by stating that 20,000 people were affected, while the actual number is much lower.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance solely because of Obamacare, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the loss of coverage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 20,000 Kansans specifically lost their health insurance due to Obamacare.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the impact of Obamacare on health insurance coverage in Kansas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the nonrenewal notices sent by insurance companies were retracted, allowing the affected individuals to keep their health insurance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the loss of health insurance coverage, such as changes in insurance plans that do not comply with new standards under the Affordable Care Act."}
