{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of dialing 112 to confirm if an unmarked car is a police officer. It implies that this method applies in all 50 states and provides a direct link to state trooper information, which may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that dialing 112 is a reliable method to confirm the identity of an unmarked police car.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that dialing 112 will result in special handling of the emergency call and immediate assistance from law enforcement, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or methods for verifying the identity of an unmarked police car, such as contacting local law enforcement directly or finding a well-lit public area to pull over.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 911 is the only official emergency number in the United States, while 112 is an emergency number in other countries.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a viral Facebook post and anecdotal evidence without providing additional reliable sources or data to support its claims.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim."}
