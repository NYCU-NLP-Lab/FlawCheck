The expert's verdict explains that the concept of rape and incest being God's will was an implication made by others based on Faught's statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the statement made by Representative George Faught. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation of what Faught actually said and the context in which it was said.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Faught's statement. The expert's verdict suggests that Faught was asserting God's sovereignty over all activities in human life, including rape and incest, rather than directly stating that they are God's will."}
