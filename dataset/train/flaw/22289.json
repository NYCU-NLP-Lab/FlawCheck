{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Trump's position on stop-and-frisk by stating that he \"thinks stop-and-frisk is fine\" without providing direct evidence of his exact stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific quotes from Donald Trump to support the assertion that he thinks stop-and-frisk is fine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's comments about stop-and-frisk during the campaign indicate his actual position on the issue, without considering the possibility that they were made for political reasons.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Trump's comments on stop-and-frisk, such as the possibility that he was referring to its effectiveness in reducing crime rather than endorsing it as a policy."}
