{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of times Bill Nelson voted in favor of higher taxes, as the expert's verdict states that the claim of 272 votes is false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the Mack campaign provided a list of about 150 tax votes, but it is not clear if all of them can be considered as votes for higher taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all votes for budget resolutions should count as votes for higher taxes, which is a problematic assumption as these resolutions are non-binding and cannot change tax law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that about half of the votes on the earlier 150-vote list were Democratic budget resolutions, which do not directly raise or lower taxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by including votes that Nelson took while in the Florida House of Representatives and in the U.S. House of Representatives, which may not be directly relevant to his Senate voting record.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
