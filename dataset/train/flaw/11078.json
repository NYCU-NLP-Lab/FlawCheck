{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Kangana Ranaut partying with Abu Salem's brother, implying a connection between the two that may not exist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that Kangana Ranaut indeed partied with Abu Salem's brother.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Kangana Ranaut in a photograph with a man automatically means she was partying with Abu Salem's brother, without providing concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the photograph, such as a chance encounter or a social gathering where multiple people were present, without any direct connection to Abu Salem's brother."}
