{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of breaks provided by President Obama to the green energy world, as it states that $90 billion was given in one year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the $90 billion figure and the assertion that it was provided in one year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the breaks provided to the green energy world were the same as tax breaks given to the oil industry, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the $90 billion figure, such as it being distributed in different ways rather than solely as tax breaks."}
