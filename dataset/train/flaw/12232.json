{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that an entry-level janitor in New York City gets paid twice as much as an entry-level teacher, without providing specific evidence or data to support this comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to verify the accuracy of the statement. It is based on a comment made by Newt Gingrich during a presidential debate and a news report, but no comprehensive analysis or data is presented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pay disparity between janitors and teachers in New York City is significant and that it is a prevalent issue. However, without more information or data, it is difficult to determine the extent of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the pay difference between janitors and teachers, such as differences in job responsibilities, qualifications, or experience levels. It presents the pay difference as a straightforward comparison without acknowledging potential factors that may contribute to the disparity."}
