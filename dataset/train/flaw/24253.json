{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Barack Obama has deported more people than any other president in this country's history. While it is true that Obama has deported a significant number of people, the claim fails to mention that George W. Bush deported more people in total during his eight years in office.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of deportations under George W. Bush by only mentioning that his cumulative total was 2 million. This number is higher than the 1.4 million deportations under Obama so far.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that Obama has deported more people than any other president in this country's history. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama has removed 1.4 million people, but it doesn't provide a comparison to other presidents to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of deportations is a measure of a president's commitment to immigrants. It suggests that Obama is not committed to immigrants based on the number of deportations, without considering other factors or policies related to immigration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of deportations under Obama. It fails to mention any specific policies or enforcement strategies that may have contributed to the increase in deportations."}
