{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the court's ruling by stating that forced sexual contact cannot be considered rape if the victim is intoxicated or unconscious. The expert's verdict clarifies that the court did not rule on this specific issue but rather dismissed the charges due to discrepancies in the case and the wording of Oklahoma's rape laws.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information about the case and the court's decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the court ruling means forced sexual contact cannot be considered rape if the victim is intoxicated or unconscious. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which explains that the court's decision was based on the specific circumstances of the case and the existing rape laws in Oklahoma.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the court's ruling. The expert's verdict provides more context and explains that the decision was based on the specific facts of the case and the interpretation of Oklahoma's rape laws."}
