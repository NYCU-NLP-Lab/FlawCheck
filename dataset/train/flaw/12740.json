{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is primarily based on social media rumors and news content, without official statements or confirmation from DIRECTV or the NFL.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that DIRECTV is offering refunds specifically to express dissatisfaction over national anthem protests, without concrete evidence or statements from the company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for DIRECTV's policy change, such as customer complaints or other factors not related to the national anthem protests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that DIRECTV's regular policy does not allow refunds once the season is underway, suggesting that exceptions are being made solely due to the protests.", "Falters at times": "The WSJ's reporting indicates that information about DIRECTV's cancellation policy was inconsistent, with different understandings of the policy among service representatives.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of refunds being offered by DIRECTV, as it is unclear whether full or prorated refunds are being provided.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the protests on DIRECTV's refund policy, as it suggests that refunds are being offered to all subscribers who express dissatisfaction with the protests, while the WSJ's report indicates that it may be limited to certain offers or plans."}
