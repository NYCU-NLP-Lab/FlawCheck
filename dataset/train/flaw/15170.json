{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video shows a drone being deployed in Brisbane, Australia to enforce social restrictions is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the video is actually from 2016 and shows a prank involving a drone in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is based on a misleading video that has been taken out of context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is recent and related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a problematic assumption as the video is actually from 2016 and has no connection to social restrictions during the pandemic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video is a prank involving a drone and has no relevance to the enforcement of social restrictions in Brisbane or any other location during the COVID-19 pandemic."}
