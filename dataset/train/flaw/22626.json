{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Barack Obama \"pays for every dime\" of his spending plans is considered an exaggeration by the expert. Obama himself has mentioned that he pays for his proposals by closing corporate loopholes and reducing inefficiencies in the healthcare system, but the expert argues that this does not fully cover the costs of his plans.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual deficit growth that would occur under Obama's plan. The expert mentions that the deficit would grow to $5.9 trillion by 2018 under Obama's plan, which is higher than what the claim implies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that Obama pays for every dime of his spending plans. The expert provides analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which suggest that the deficit would still increase under Obama's proposals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's proposed spending cuts and measures to increase revenue would be sufficient to cover the costs of his plans. The expert questions the feasibility of these measures in closing the deficit gap.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that spending cuts to existing programs or other measures would be necessary to close the deficit gap, but the claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the deficit would not be fully covered by Obama's proposed measures, as indicated by the analysis from the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget."}
