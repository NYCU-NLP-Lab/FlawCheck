{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Obama became the chairman of the subcommittee at the beginning of his presidential campaign in 2007, which limited the amount of time available for oversight hearings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Obama \"hasn't done much of anything\" as chairman of the subcommittee.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that holding substantive hearings is the only measure of effectiveness as the chairman of the subcommittee, without considering other potential actions or responsibilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by a spokesman for Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, suggesting that major issues like NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee rather than Obama's European subcommittee.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Afghanistan that included discussions on NATO, which Obama did not attend due to his participation in a Democratic debate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully acknowledging the limitations and constraints faced by Obama as chairman of the subcommittee during his presidential campaign.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of substantive hearings by not considering other potential actions or initiatives undertaken by Obama in his role as chairman."}
