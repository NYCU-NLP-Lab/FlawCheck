{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Barack Obama wants to force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks.", "Lack enough support": "The expert states that the articles provided as evidence do not address whether Obama believes protesters should be allowed to camp out indefinitely in parks.", "Contradict fact": "The expert found evidence that contradicts the claim, such as an exchange between a journalist and White House press secretary Jay Carney, where Carney defers to local authorities and emphasizes the need to balance First Amendment concerns with public safety and health concerns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that one way the federal government might \"force\" local governments to allow protesters to live in parks is by overturning a Supreme Court case, but clarifies that a president cannot do that and there is no evidence that Obama wants to."}
