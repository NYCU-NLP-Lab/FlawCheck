{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue of showers and dishwashers not functioning properly due to low-flow standards. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump \"riffed\" on poorly functioning appliances, suggesting that the issue may not be as widespread or significant as portrayed in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that low-flow standards are the sole cause of showers and dishwashers not functioning properly. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough information to determine if this assumption is accurate or not.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that showers and dishwashers are not functioning properly due to low-flow standards. It is unclear if there is sufficient evidence to back up this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump spoke about energy-efficiency standards, which could suggest that there may be alternative explanations for the issues with showers and dishwashers, such as energy-saving features or other factors not related to low-flow standards. However, this alternative explanation is not explicitly stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering in its accuracy or reliability due to the lack of specific evidence or support for the assertion made about showers and dishwashers. The expert's verdict mentions the need to combat rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggests that the claim may be subject to scrutiny or skepticism."}
