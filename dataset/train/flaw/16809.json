{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Obama's policies on the price of gasoline by stating that it has \"nearly doubled\" since he took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that President Obama's policies are solely responsible for the increase in gas prices.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between President Obama's policies and the increase in gas prices without considering other factors such as global oil markets and geopolitical events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in gas prices, such as changes in global oil supply and demand or fluctuations in international oil prices."}
