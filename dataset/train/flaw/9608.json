{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that stations had to pull Cruz's TV ad off the air, when in fact it was a different ad that was pulled.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or details about the alleged lie in Cruz's TV ad about John Kasich.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cruz's nickname \"Lyin' Ted\" is widely used, without providing evidence or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the attack ad against Cruz was released by a political action committee supporting Kasich, rather than by Cruz himself."}
