{"Exaggerate": "President Trump's claim of giving HBCUs more money than they asked for and saying they needed more can be seen as an exaggeration.", "Understate": "The claim understates the funding that HBCUs received under the same program during President Obama's time in the White House.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as two experts calculated the total federal funding provided to HBCUs and found little change between the Obama years and the first year under Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the Trump administration has consistently been supportive of HBCUs, despite attempts to trim funding for federal TRIO programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the representatives of HBCUs repeatedly meeting with Trump, such as discussing the need for additional funding rather than having \"no funding\" before him.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that HBCUs received funding before Trump, and it is inaccurate to claim that he \"saved\" them.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by ignoring the bipartisan nature of the FUTURE Act, which made permanent funding for HBCUs, and the fact that the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities program has been awarding grants to HBCUs for decades."}
