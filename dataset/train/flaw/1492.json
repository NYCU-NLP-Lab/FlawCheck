{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photograph shows a rare Nagapushpa flower that blooms only once every 36 years contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that the photograph does not depict any type of flower or plant but a sea pen.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or reliable sources to back up the existence of a rare Nagapushpa flower that blooms once every 36 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph indeed shows a rare Nagapushpa flower, without providing any substantial proof or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that it is actually a sea pen, a marine invertebrate, and not a flower as claimed."}
