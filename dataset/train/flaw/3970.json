{"Exaggerate": "There is a possibility of exaggeration in the claim that taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when Cuomo started. While taxes have been reduced for certain income levels and business categories, it is not clear if this reduction applies to every single New Yorker.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that taxes for every New Yorker are lower. The provided information only focuses on income taxes and business taxes, without considering other types of taxes that may affect different individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that lower taxes are the sole reason for New Yorkers leaving the state. It overlooks other factors such as cost of living, job opportunities, and quality of life, which may also contribute to people's decision to leave.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in taxes, such as changes in tax policies at the federal level or economic factors that may have influenced the state's revenue.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of tax reductions for certain income levels and business categories. While the reductions may not be dramatic for high earners, they could still have a significant effect on their overall tax burden.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any factual information provided."}
