{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the federal income tax rate was not actually 0 percent until 1913. While it is true that the income tax was ratified and enacted in 1913, there were exemptions and a graduated surtax in place, meaning that not all Americans were exempt from paying taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the federal income tax rate was 0 percent until 1913. The expert's verdict provides historical context and information that contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that having a 0 percent income tax rate is inherently better. It assumes that there are no benefits or reasons for having an income tax and does not consider the implications of such a policy on government revenue and public services.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by highlighting the exemptions and graduated surtax that were in place in the 1913 income tax law. This suggests that the claim's assertion of a 0 percent income tax rate is not accurate."}
