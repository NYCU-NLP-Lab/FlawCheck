You would've had nothing left\" contradicts the fact that Michigan has lost motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs under Trump.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the success of bringing back the car industry in Michigan, as the data shows a decline in jobs in that sector.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the car industry in Michigan was finished and would have had nothing left without Trump's intervention.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the car industry in Michigan was saved solely due to Trump's actions, without considering other factors that may have contributed to its recovery.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the state of the car industry in Michigan, such as economic factors and industry trends, which are not addressed in the claim."}
