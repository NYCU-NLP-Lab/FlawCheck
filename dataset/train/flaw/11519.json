{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Charlie Crist's governorship on utility costs by stating that they went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average. The data shows that the spike in electric rates was not caused by an increase in base rates but by large increases in fuel recovery costs.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Rick Scott's governorship on utility rates by stating that they have come down 11 percent and are now below the average. The data does not provide a clear comparison of utility rates during Scott's tenure and the national average.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing comprehensive data on utility rates during both Charlie Crist's and Rick Scott's governorships. The data provided only focuses on three utilities and does not provide a complete picture of the overall electric rates in Florida.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in utility rates is solely attributable to the actions of the governor. However, the data shows that fuel prices for utility companies continued to fall, but the overall electric rate did not drop at the same speed due to an increase in base rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in utility costs during Charlie Crist's governorship, such as the steep increase in natural gas prices nationwide. The data suggests that the spike in electric rates was largely influenced by external factors beyond the control of the governor."}
