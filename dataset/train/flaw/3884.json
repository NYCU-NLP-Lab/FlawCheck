{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the protesting farmers replaced the Indian flag with the Khalistan flag on the Red Fort.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are several videos that confirm that the Indian flag was not replaced or taken down.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protestors were trying to make a point by replacing the tricolour with their religious flag, without providing evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the protestors hoisted a flag from an empty pole mast and did not replace the Indian flag with the Khalistan flag."}
