{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Joe Biden has issued executive fiats, as it compares him to all other presidents in history.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the comparison of Joe Biden's executive fiats to those of other presidents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Joe Biden has issued more executive fiats, such as specific circumstances or the urgency of certain issues.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a comprehensive analysis of executive fiats issued by all presidents, as the available record before FDR is incomplete.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that issuing a high number of executive fiats in a short period of time is inherently negative or problematic without providing further context or justification.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the number of executive fiats issued by Joe Biden."}
