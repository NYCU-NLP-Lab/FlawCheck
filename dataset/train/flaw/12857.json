{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump called for the revocation of \"Noble Prizes\" awarded to \"lamestream media\" reporters. The correct term is Nobel Prizes, and the Nobel Foundation does not award prizes for journalism.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that President Trump posted and then deleted these tweets.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tweets were deleted by President Trump, but it does not provide any evidence or proof of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the tweets, such as the possibility of the tweets being fabricated or falsely attributed to President Trump. However, the claim does not consider or explore any alternative explanations."}
