{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that accepting the District's proposal would result in \"NO pay increase for 4 years\" and \"Seven years of frozen wages.\" This is not entirely accurate as it only applies to teachers who have already reached the top step of the salary schedule.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the proposal does not apply to all teachers, but only to those who have already reached the top step of the salary schedule.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"Seven years of frozen wages = Disrespect.\" This is a subjective interpretation and does not provide sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the district's proposal, such as financial constraints or budget limitations."}
