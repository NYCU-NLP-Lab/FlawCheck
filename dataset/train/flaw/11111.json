{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of living grandchildren of John Tyler by stating that there are two, when in fact there is only one remaining grandchild.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that two grandchildren of John Tyler are still alive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there are two living grandchildren of John Tyler without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that there is only one remaining grandchild of John Tyler, which is supported by the expert's verdict."}
