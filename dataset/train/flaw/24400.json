{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the signals analyzed by the scientists are \"probably\" caused by aliens, without providing concrete evidence or proof.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that the signals are indeed caused by aliens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the signals, such as instrumental defects or other natural phenomena.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the signals analyzed by the scientists are only found in a small fraction of the 2.5 million stars, indicating that they are not widespread or prevalent.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the findings by stating that the signals are \"probably\" caused by aliens, without acknowledging the speculative nature of the hypothesis.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations or uncertainties of the research by using the word \"probably\" to qualify the conclusion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of logical reasoning by relying on circular logic, where the prediction of the signals is based on a previous study by one of the scientists."}
