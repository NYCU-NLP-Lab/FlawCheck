{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the Madagascan president by stating that he called on all African nations to quit the World Health Organization (WHO). The actual statement made by the president is not mentioned, and it is unclear if he explicitly called for African nations to quit the WHO.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that the Madagascan president called on African states to quit the WHO. It only cites a Facebook post without providing any other sources or direct quotes from the president.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Madagascan president's distribution of the herbal tea, Covid-Organics, and his criticism of Europe's response to the remedy implies that he wants African states to quit the WHO. However, there is no direct evidence or explicit statement from the president supporting this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the Madagascan president is promoting the use of traditional medicine, such as the herbal tea, as a complementary approach to Western medicine, rather than advocating for African states to quit the WHO."}
