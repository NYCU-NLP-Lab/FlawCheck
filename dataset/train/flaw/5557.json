{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that health insurance company CEOs are paid by stating that they receive $24 million a year. The expert's verdict confirms that the highest-paid CEO actually received $38.125 million in the 2009 survey.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides one source, the 2008 Forbes magazine executive compensation survey, to back up the assertion. The expert's verdict also mentions that the 2009 survey provides more recent and higher compensation figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all health insurance company CEOs are paid $24 million a year based on the example of one CEO. The expert's verdict points out that the highest-paid CEO's compensation is significantly higher than the average compensation of other CEOs in the industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the high CEO compensation, such as the complexity of calculating executive compensation and the inclusion of various components like salary, benefits, deferred compensation, and stock options. The expert's verdict acknowledges that executive compensation is notoriously complicated to calculate."}
