{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Coca-Cola has launched a brand campaign in support of the farmers' protest. The expert mentions that the viral image is a misrepresentation of the brand and that the company has not launched any such campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of Coca-Cola bottles with the text \"Kisan Ekta\" and \"Support Farmer\" indicates the company's support for the farmers' protest. However, the expert points out that the image appears to be a morphed version of an old campaign by Coca-Cola.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Coca-Cola has explicitly stated that they have not launched any brand campaign in support of the farmers' protest. The expert quotes the public relations officer of Coca-Cola India confirming this.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the viral image by implying that it represents Coca-Cola's global support for the farmers' protest. The expert highlights that the image is being widely shared on social media but does not provide any evidence of the company's actual support.", "Understate": "No biases of understating are evident in the provided claim."}
