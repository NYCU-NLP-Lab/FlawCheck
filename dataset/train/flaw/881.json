{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of electoral votes that Trump will have on Election Night, stating that he will be \"over 290 electoral votes.\" The expert's verdict explains that electoral votes won't be cast until Dec. 14 and won't be counted until Jan. 6.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that electoral votes won't be cast or counted until later, but asserts that Trump will have a specific number of electoral votes on Election Night.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that Trump will have over 290 electoral votes on Election Night.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Democrats will try to \"steal\" the election after Election Night, without providing evidence or support for this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the uncertainty and complexity of the election process, particularly regarding the counting of mail-in ballots and the potential for a partisan skew in the results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for why early returns on Election Night may favor Trump, citing the partisan skew in voting methods and the preference of Republicans to vote in person on Election Day."}
