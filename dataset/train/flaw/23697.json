{"Exaggerate": "The claim of increasing the VA budget by 85 percent may be seen as an exaggeration, as it is not clear how much of that increase is due to the actions of the Obama administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to fully validate the 85 percent increase in the VA budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the VA budget is solely due to the actions of the Obama administration, without considering other factors such as mandatory spending requirements and the impact of wars on veteran eligibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The increase in the VA budget can be attributed to factors beyond the control of the Obama administration, such as the increase in veterans due to ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."}
