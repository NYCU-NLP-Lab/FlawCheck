{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Indian soldiers killed in clashes with Chinese forces, stating that at least 50 soldiers were killed, while the official acknowledgment is only 20.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photographs of coffins belong to the Indian soldiers who died in the recent clashes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs of coffins wrapped in the Indian national flag are evidence of Indian soldiers' deaths in the Galwan Valley clashes, without providing substantial proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that the photographs are actually old images related to a different incident (the Pulwama attack) and not related to the Galwan Valley clashes."}
