{"Exaggerate": "The claim may have exaggerated the extent of the discount being offered to pregnant women, as the expert's verdict states that it was a location-specific discount and not a national promotion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a viral social media post and not on concrete evidence or official statements from Cold Stone Creamery.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cold Stone Creamery is giving free or discounted ice cream to pregnant women solely based on their appearance, without considering other factors or criteria.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the discount offered to pregnant women may not be solely based on their appearance, but rather a location-specific offer made by individual Cold Stone Creamery franchisees. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assumption."}
