{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Mark Kelly is dressed as Adolf Hitler in the yearbook photo. There are no quotes or direct confirmation from anyone confirming Kelly's presence in the picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the photo is Mark Kelly without any concrete evidence or identification. It is an assumption based on similarities in sunglasses worn by the person in the photo and Kelly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Multiple people who attended the Merchant Marine Academy with Kelly, including two people in the picture, have stated that Kelly is not the person in the photo. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the identity of the person in the photo.", "Contradict fact": "Kelly's campaign manager and the campaign itself have strongly denied the claims and called them false. They have provided statements asserting that the photos are not of Mark Kelly and that he never dressed up in such a costume.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance and impact of the allegation by presenting it as just a yearbook photo. The association with Adolf Hitler can have serious implications and consequences for a political candidate.", "Exaggerate": "It does not appear that there is any exaggeration bias present in the claim.", "Falters at times": "It does not appear that there is any significant faltering bias present in the claim."}
