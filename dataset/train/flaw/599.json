{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Obama's election on the market by referring to it as a \"crash\" when it was actually a decline that was part of a larger trend set off by the 2008 financial crisis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's election was the cause of the market decline, ignoring the larger economic factors at play, such as the financial crisis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that President Obama's election directly caused the market decline.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the market decline was not an \"instant reaction\" to President Obama's election, but rather part of a longer-term trend.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the market decline, such as the financial crisis and other economic factors."}
