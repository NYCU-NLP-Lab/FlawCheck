{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the image's author seemingly relied on a separate, searchable database of CDC statistics, called CDC WONDER, and preliminary COVID-19 mortality data, which were not provided in the image.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the number of deaths in 2020 is almost the same as previous years, despite the presence of COVID-19, without providing sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the similar number of deaths in 2020 compared to previous years, such as changes in reporting methods or other factors not accounted for in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were almost 21 million COVID-19 cases in the U.S. in 2020, suggesting that the deadliness of the coronavirus is being downplayed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of COVID-19 by suggesting that the number of deaths in 2020 is almost the same as previous years, despite the presence of the pandemic.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on incomplete data and sources to support its argument.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the similarity in the number of deaths in 2020 compared to previous years, without considering the specific impact of COVID-19."}
