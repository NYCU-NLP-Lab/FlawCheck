{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it states that the Obama administration \"didn't lock people up in cages,\" implying that no cages were used at all.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that people were not locked up in cages during the Obama administration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of cages is the sole determinant of whether families were separated or mistreated at the border, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as it is acknowledged that there were enclosures for migrant children during the Obama administration, although they may not have been referred to as \"cages\" by the administration."}
