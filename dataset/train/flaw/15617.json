This assumption suggests a bias against accepting the claim without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The fact that snowfall is rare in Ain Sefra raises the possibility of alternative explanations for the photographs, such as manipulation or misinterpretation. However, the expert's verdict provides supporting evidence from historical data and NASA satellite data, which counteracts this bias.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the snowfall by describing it as simply \"snow on the ground.\" The expert's verdict describes it as a \"stunning\" event, suggesting a potential bias towards downplaying the impact.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the last significant snowfall in Ain Sefra occurred in February 1979, while the claim does not mention this previous occurrence. This contradiction indicates a bias in the claim towards presenting the snowfall as a unique event.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately conveying the details of the snowfall in Ain Sefra.
