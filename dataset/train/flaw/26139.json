{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the former vice president of Pfizer, Dr. Peter Rost, suggesting that he called the Gardasil vaccine \"deadly\" when he did not directly say that.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gardasil is not manufactured by Pfizer but by Merck, making it unlikely for a Pfizer executive to blow the whistle on a product they don't make.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it relies on a misleading and confusing article from an alternative health blog that mischaracterizes quotes and takes them out of context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the former vice president of Pfizer's views on the pharmaceutical industry's influence over academic institutions and researchers are directly related to the safety or efficacy of the Gardasil vaccine, which is not explicitly stated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, suggesting that the former vice president of Pfizer was discussing the pharmaceutical industry's practices in general, rather than specifically addressing the Gardasil vaccine."}
