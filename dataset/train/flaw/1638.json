{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the existence of an Antifa-issued credit card. The provided information states that the photograph is a prop sold on a satirical website, indicating that it is not a genuine item.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph of the alleged Antifa-issued credit card is real and represents the existence of such cards. However, it is actually a satirical prop, suggesting that the assumption is problematic.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the photograph by presenting it as evidence of Antifa's status as a centrally organized and well-funded \"terrorist organization.\" The information provided suggests that this is a trope associated with claims made by critics, rather than a factual representation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph is a satirical prop and not a genuine Antifa-issued credit card. This contradiction undermines the claim's validity.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim faltering at times in the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photograph, such as it being a satirical prop, rather than a genuine Antifa-issued credit card. However, this bias is not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict."}
