{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of COLA increases on Social Security recipients by suggesting that Congress will not allow any increase, while in reality, there have been increases in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Congress will not allow Social Security recipients to get a COLA increase. It does not provide any evidence or specific examples to back up this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Congress has control over COLA increases, which is not the case. The expert's verdict clarifies that Congress does not have the power to decide whether or not to allow COLAs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the lack of COLA increases is due to Congress diverting funds to \"Obamacare.\" However, the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Congress has no control over COLAs and cannot pre-empt them for other purposes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been COLA increases in the past and that the most recent increase was 2.8% in 2018.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Medicare premium increases by stating that Obamacare raises the cost, without providing specific evidence or context for these increases.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting fragmented information and mixing different topics like COLA increases, Medicare premiums, and Obamacare, without providing a clear and coherent argument."}
