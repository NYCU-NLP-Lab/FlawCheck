{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difficulty of the 7-10 split by describing it as \"the definition of an impossible task\" and stating that it is \"practically\" impossible.", "Understate": "The claim understates the difficulty of other splits by not providing enough information about them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the 7-10 split is the toughest split in bowling. It only provides anecdotal evidence and does not present any scientific data or expert opinions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the possibility that there may be other factors, such as lane conditions or bowler skill, that could affect the difficulty of different splits."}
