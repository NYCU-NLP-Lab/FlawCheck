{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the success in reducing the street population by stating a 40 percent reduction and getting 12,000 people off the street, without providing enough evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the 40 percent reduction in the street population. The evidence provided only shows a decrease in the street population from 2002 to 2009, but does not provide data for the entire period mentioned by Newsom.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in the street population can be solely attributed to Newsom's leadership, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent picture of the street population reduction. While it initially states a 40 percent reduction, it later mentions an increase in the street population during Newsom's final two years as mayor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in the street population, such as the closure of homeless programs and the impact of private landlords selling buildings housing those services."}
