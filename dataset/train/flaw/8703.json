{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it highlights a specific decrease in street homelessness without considering the overall homelessness situation or the number of people in shelters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the specific percentage decrease in street homelessness.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in street homelessness is solely attributed to the actions of Michael Bloomberg during his tenure as mayor, without considering other factors or initiatives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations for the decrease in street homelessness, such as changes in city policies, economic factors, or other initiatives not directly related to Bloomberg's actions."}
