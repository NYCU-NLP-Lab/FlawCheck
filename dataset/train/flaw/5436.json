{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children in America who go to sleep hungry at night. The expert's verdict states that the actual number is about 8.8 percent, not 20 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific data to back up the statement that 1 in 5 children in America goes to sleep hungry at night.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of children going to sleep hungry is directly related to poverty, without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data provided by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which show that the percentage of children experiencing very low food security (hunger) is much lower than 20 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using imprecise language and making a sweeping generalization without providing specific details or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for childhood hunger, such as factors other than poverty that may contribute to food insecurity."}
