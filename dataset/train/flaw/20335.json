{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a 2004 report and a 2013 paper, both of which are outdated and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that minimum wage workers who continue employment will receive a raise within a year, without considering other factors such as job market conditions or individual performance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why minimum wage workers may receive a raise within a year, such as inflation or changes in labor laws.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of minimum wage workers who actually receive a raise within a year, as it only focuses on those who continue employment and excludes those who leave the labor force or become unemployed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on outdated data and not considering the potential impact of external factors on minimum wage workers' ability to receive a raise.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a significant percentage of minimum wage workers leave the labor force or become unemployed within a year, as indicated by the 2013 paper.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the likelihood of minimum wage workers receiving a raise within a year, as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all minimum wage workers and their circumstances."}
