{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Rick Kriseman is over budget on the new police station. The expert's verdict mentions that the current budget is $35 million higher than the 2006 estimate, but it does not necessarily mean that Kriseman is $35 million over budget.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Rick Kriseman is $35 million over budget on the new police station. The expert's verdict mentions that the expected price hike does not prove dramatic cost overruns driven by Kriseman.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $35 million increase in the price tag for the new police station is solely due to cost overruns under Rick Kriseman's administration. However, the expert's verdict points out that the estimate to replace the police station came in at $50 million in 2006, which pre-dates Kriseman.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in the price tag, such as the city's prior knowledge that it would take more than $50 million to replace the police headquarters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Kriseman's statement that the police station is under budget and ahead of schedule. The expert's verdict rates Kriseman's statement as Mostly False.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by comparing two different projects (the new pier and the new police station) and holding Kriseman accountable for the cost overruns on both. The expert's verdict points out that the projects are separate and Kriseman cannot be solely blamed for the cost increase on the police station.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
