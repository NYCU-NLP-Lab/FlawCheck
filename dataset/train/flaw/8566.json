{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the FBI discovered the photograph behind a dumpster in 1982 contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that the photograph was taken by photographer Eliot Lee Hazel around 2010.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph by suggesting it is associated with an open investigation and unsolved mysteries from 1982, whereas the expert's verdict states that it is part of a photography collection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the assertion that the FBI discovered the photograph behind a dumpster in 1982.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is connected to a mysterious event or crime, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that it was part of a photography collection by Eliot Lee Hazel and not connected to any FBI investigation or unsolved mysteries."}
