{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of preexisting immunity to COVID-19, suggesting that about a third of the public has cross-reactivity, which is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence to support the assertion of preexisting immunity to COVID-19 through cross-reactivity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that preexisting immunity through cross-reactivity would contribute to herd immunity, which scientists argue is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim contradicts the findings of studies that suggest cross-reactive antibodies that can prevent infection with the coronavirus are not widespread in the population."}
