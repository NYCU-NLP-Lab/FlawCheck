{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Democrats were at a 9/11 memorial service when NC Republicans held a controversial vote is exaggerated. Most Democrats were not at a 9/11 memorial service.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is only one Democrat, Rep. Garland Pierce, who claimed to be at a 9/11 event. No other Democrats have come forward to confirm their presence at a memorial service.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Republicans used a 9/11 memorial to trick Democrats into missing a key vote. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the absence of Democrats during the vote. Most Democrats skipped the morning session because they believed it would be a non-voting session, based on information provided by Rep. David Lewis."}
