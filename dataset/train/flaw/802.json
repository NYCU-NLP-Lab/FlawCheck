{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the health care bill exempting congressional leadership and committee staff. The expert's verdict states that lawmakers and congressional staff are not exempt from broader health care reform but are required to buy health insurance through an exchange.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the exemption of congressional leadership and committee staff from buying health coverage through an insurance exchange will appall the American people. This assumption may be subjective and based on personal opinion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that the American people will be appalled by the exemption. It is not clear how the claimant arrived at this conclusion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that the exemption of congressional staff from their employer's health care plan is a specific provision in the bill, rather than a complete exemption from health care reform."}
