{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that property taxes are lower today than they were in 2010. The provided information includes some data on property tax payments from 2010 to 2016, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison to determine if property taxes have indeed decreased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that property taxes have decreased without considering other factors such as changes in property values, local levies, or the impact of government actions. It fails to acknowledge that property taxes can vary based on individual circumstances and community factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The information provided suggests that property tax reductions may not solely be attributed to policy actions but could also be influenced by changes in housing values or shifts in tax burdens between different property types (residential, commercial, manufacturing).", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in presenting a clear and comprehensive analysis of property tax trends. While there are some references to reports and statements from politicians, the information provided lacks consistency and may not provide a complete picture of the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that property taxes can vary for different individuals and communities. While some property owners may have experienced lower taxes, others may have seen an increase due to various factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and variability of property tax payments by presenting a simplified statement that property taxes are lower today than in 2010 without acknowledging the nuances and individual experiences.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
