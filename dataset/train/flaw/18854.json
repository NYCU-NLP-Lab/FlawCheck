{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the attendance record of Maxine Waters by stating that she has shown up to only 10 percent of congressional meetings for 35 years, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a fake statistic from a Reddit thread, which is not a reliable or credible source of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that attending congressional meetings is the only measure of a congressperson's job performance, without considering other aspects such as voting record or committee participation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Maxine Waters has not been in Congress for 35 years, but rather for 26 years.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Maxine Waters' actual attendance record, as she has only missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991, according to GovTrack.us."}
