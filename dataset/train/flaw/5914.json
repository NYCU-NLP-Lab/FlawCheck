{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol was a \"hoax,\" which is an exaggerated statement considering the overwhelming evidence and eyewitness accounts of the events that took place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the riot was a \"hoax.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the lawmaker made baseless claims and there is no substantial evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Jan. 6 riot was staged to reflect poorly on then-U.S. President Donald Trump, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the Jan. 6 riot, such as the documented involvement of pro-Trump supporters and extremist groups in the violence."}
