{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Virginia's current unemployment rate being \"the lowest in Virginia history\" is an exaggeration, as there have been periods in the past with lower unemployment rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that the unemployment rate has been lower in the past.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current unemployment rate is the lowest in Virginia history without considering historical data that proves otherwise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be seen as an attempt to reiterate the point made by Governor Terry McAuliffe that the current unemployment rate is the lowest since 2008, rather than the lowest in Virginia history."}
