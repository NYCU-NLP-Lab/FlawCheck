{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that 2015 was the best year for the auto industry in American history, without providing sufficient evidence or considering long-term issues with American manufacturers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one measure (increased car sales in 2015) to support the assertion that it was the best year for the auto industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increased car sales in 2015, such as the improving economy, cheap gas prices, available credit, and low interest rates for loans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increased car sales in 2015 indicate the overall health and success of the auto industry, without considering other factors or long-term trends.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential long-term issues with American manufacturers and the growing market share of foreign manufacturers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the record-breaking total vehicle sales figure includes foreign models sold in the United States as well, not just American-made cars."}
