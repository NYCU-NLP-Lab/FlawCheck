{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines by stating that they will alter the individual's genetic material and prevent treatment for COVID-19 if symptoms develop.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that mRNA vaccines cannot alter or interact with a person's genome.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or support to substantiate its assertion that mRNA vaccines will alter the individual's genetic material and prevent treatment for COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that mRNA vaccines have the ability to permanently alter an individual's genetic material, which is a problematic assumption without scientific basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by experts that mRNA vaccines instruct cells to produce a protein found in the COVID-19 virus, without directly altering the individual's genetic material."}
