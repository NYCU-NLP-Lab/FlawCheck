{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the frequency or magnitude of drugs being catapulted across the border. While there have been instances of drugs being seized and catapults being found, it is unclear how often this occurs and if it is a widespread problem.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that drugs have been catapulted across the border and hit people on the head. While there have been reports of drugs being seized and catapults being found, there is no specific information provided about people being hit by these drugs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a see-through wall would prevent drugs from being catapulted across the border and hitting people. This assumption may not be entirely accurate, as there are other methods and means by which drugs can be smuggled into the country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that drugs are being catapulted across the border, there could be alternative explanations for the presence of drugs on the American side, such as tunnels, drones, or other smuggling methods. The claim does not consider these alternative possibilities."}
