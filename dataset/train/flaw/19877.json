{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs that would exist today if the recovery were more typical of the postwar era. The expert's analysis shows that the actual number ranges from 12.4 million to 13.6 million, but the claim rounds it up to 14 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide detailed evidence or data to back up the assertion that the recovery is not typical of the postwar era.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the recovery should be more typical of the postwar era, without providing a clear justification for why that should be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the current state of the economy or the factors that may have contributed to the lack of job growth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the recovery is not typical of the postwar era, as the expert's analysis shows that the number of jobs is actually within the range of previous recessions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by cherry-picking higher numbers and rounding up the figures to support the argument, rather than providing a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the data.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim."}
