{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the tax by stating that it will make soda sold in Chicago among the most expensive in the country. The expert's verdict mentions that the total price figures to be slightly higher in Chicago compared to the rest of Cook County, but it is unclear if it would actually be the most expensive in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim that the new tax will make soda sold in Chicago among the most expensive in the country. It only mentions the additional tax of one cent per ounce and the existing sales taxes in Chicago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the price of soda is the main factor in determining whether it is among the most expensive in the country. The expert's verdict suggests that the add-on cost of taxes is likely the prime factor, but there may be other factors to consider.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the tax is imposed in other locations as well, and Chicago is not the only place with a soda tax. Therefore, there may be alternative explanations for why soda sold in Chicago would be among the most expensive in the country, such as higher prices in other cities with similar taxes."}
