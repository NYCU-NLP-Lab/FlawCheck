{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the bridge scandal by stating that \"no one cares about Bridgegate\" and that voters haven't been asking about it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the three independent investigations provide a conclusive verdict on Christie's prior knowledge or involvement in the lane closures, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures. The evidence provided includes Christie's denial, the results of an internal probe commissioned by his administration, and statements from officials, but there may be a lack of comprehensive evidence to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations or motives for the lane closures, such as political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, New Jersey.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation came to a less definitive conclusion on Christie's involvement, suggesting that there may be conflicting findings and interpretations regarding his knowledge and involvement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the investigations fully exonerate Christie, as there may be limitations or gaps in the evidence that were not fully addressed."}
