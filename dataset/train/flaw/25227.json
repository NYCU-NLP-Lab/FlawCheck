{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of Millennials who have moved back in with their parents. While the claim states that one-third of the age group have done so, the Pew Research Center report actually found that 36 percent of them were living with their parents, slightly higher than one-third.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support it. It is based on a report by the Pew Research Center, but it does not provide any additional data or analysis to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high percentage of Millennials living with their parents is solely due to the financial realities of high college tuition and a tight job market. However, the Pew report suggests that there are multiple factors contributing to this trend, including declining employment among young adults and an increase in unmarried Millennials.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of Millennials living with their parents. The Pew report suggests that including college students living in dormitories as residing with their parents may skew the data, and some may argue that categorizing those students as living with their parents is not accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the proportion of 18- to 31-year-olds living with their parents has been fairly stable over the last 50 years. The report shows that in 1968, 32 percent of the age group lived with their parents, and in 1981 it was 31 percent. In 2007, before the Great Recession, 32 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds lived with their parents.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a clear and accurate picture of the situation. While it highlights the high percentage of Millennials living with their parents, it fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of the historical trends and alternative explanations for this phenomenon."}
