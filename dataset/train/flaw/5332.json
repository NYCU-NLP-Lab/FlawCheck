{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of money spent on image consultants by stating that Eric Greitens \"spent another $600,000 on image consultants.\" This could be seen as an exaggeration if the actual amount spent is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Eric Greitens spent $600,000 on image consultants. This lack of supporting evidence could be considered a bias.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spending money on image consultants is inherently negative or questionable. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential benefits or reasons for hiring image consultants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or present any alternative explanations for why Eric Greitens' charity may have hired image consultants. This lack of alternative perspectives could be considered a bias."}
