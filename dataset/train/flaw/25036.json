{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the \"riot\" manual, presenting it as evidence of coordinated protests by Democrats, when in fact it is a recirculated hoax from several years earlier.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the manual was issued by Democrats. The only evidence provided is a page image with the name and logo of a super PAC, which had actually merged with another organization in 2014.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the appearance of the Friends of Democracy logo on the manual is a clue that it is linked to the George Floyd protests of May 2020, when in fact the organization had merged years earlier.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the existence of the manual, such as it being a hoax or a fabrication by individuals unrelated to the Democratic party.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the manual is a recirculated hoax from several years earlier, which was linked to the April 2015 riots in Baltimore, not the George Floyd protests of May 2020.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not directly relevant to the main topic, such as the founder of Snopes and the copyright notice."}
