{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of being immunized against Covid-19 on life insurance payments by stating that Manulife will deny payments.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on anecdotal evidence from social media posts and does not provide substantial evidence to support the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Manulife will deny life insurance payments solely based on being immunized against Covid-19, without considering other factors that may affect insurance coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that Manulife has explicitly stated that being immunized against Covid-19 does not affect life insurance coverage, contradicting the claim made in the post."}
