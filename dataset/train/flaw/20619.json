{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of male stubbornness and chauvinistic attitudes on road fatalities. The expert's verdict provides data that shows men account for 78.4% of fatalities, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that this is solely due to their stubborn and chauvinistic attitudes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between male stubbornness and chauvinistic attitudes and road fatalities. The expert's verdict provides data on the gender breakdown of road fatalities, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that these attitudes are the primary cause.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that male stubbornness and chauvinistic attitudes are the main factors contributing to road fatalities. This assumption may overlook other potential causes such as reckless driving, poor road infrastructure, or lack of enforcement of traffic laws.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the gender disparity in road fatalities. The expert's verdict mentions that women and girls made up 21.1% of the death toll, but it does not explore other potential factors contributing to this disparity.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately attributing the cause of road fatalities solely to male stubbornness and chauvinistic attitudes. The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence to support this specific claim."}
