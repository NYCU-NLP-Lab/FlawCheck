{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of the \"war on coal\" by stating that the president's own advisers have said there is a war on coal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or quotes from the president's advisers to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by one adviser, Daniel Schrag, represents the views of all the president's advisers, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the statement made by Daniel Schrag, such as advocating for cleaner energy sources rather than specifically targeting coal."}
