{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that all U.S. companies operating overseas telephone service centers must transfer customers to U.S.-based representatives upon request. The expert's verdict clarifies that there is no federal law requiring such transfers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that all U.S. companies using overseas operators must transfer customers to American representatives upon request. The examples provided by the claimant are anecdotal and not supported by broader evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of overseas call centers is solely due to cheaper labor costs. Other factors, such as language skills or availability of skilled workers, could also be reasons for companies to operate call centers in other countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the use of overseas call centers, such as the need for 24/7 customer service or the ability to cater to customers in different time zones."}
