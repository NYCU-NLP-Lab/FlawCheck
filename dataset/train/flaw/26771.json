{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in gas prices since Obama took office by stating that it has gone up by $2, without providing any evidence or context to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that gas prices are solely influenced by the actions of the President, without considering other factors such as global oil markets and international events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests alternative explanations for gas price fluctuations, such as international commodity trading, speculative energy contracts, and strategic oil reserves, which contradict the claim that gas prices are solely determined by the President's actions."}
