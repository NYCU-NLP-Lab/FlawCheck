{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of voter fraud in the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire by stating that it was \"likely changed\" through voter fraud, while the expert's verdict suggests that there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voter fraud occurred based on the fact that several thousand people who registered to vote on Election Day with an out-of-state driver's license did not subsequently register a car or obtain a driver's license in New Hampshire. However, the expert points out that this assumption is flawed as many of these individuals could be college students who are legally allowed to vote in New Hampshire.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire was changed through voter fraud. The expert's verdict highlights that the evidence provided by Kris Kobach, the vice chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, is not substantial enough to prove widespread voter fraud.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the behavior of the individuals who registered to vote with out-of-state driver's licenses. They could be college students who are legally eligible to vote in New Hampshire, rather than fraudulent voters.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential validity of the individuals who registered to vote with out-of-state driver's licenses. The expert's verdict suggests that it is plausible that these individuals are legitimate voters, such as college students, rather than fraudulent voters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no concrete proof of voter fraud in the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire, as stated by the expert's verdict."}
