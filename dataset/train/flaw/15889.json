{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the power and influence of the 15 political appointees on the IPAB by stating that they will make all major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans. The expert's verdict suggests that the IPAB's role is more limited and focused on making plans to slow the growth of costs for Medicare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the IPAB will have the authority to make all major health care decisions for Americans, which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict indicates that the IPAB's role is specifically related to addressing the growth of costs in Medicare.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that the IPAB will have such extensive decision-making power. The expert's verdict suggests that the IPAB's role is more specific and targeted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the role and authority of the IPAB. The expert's verdict provides additional information and context about the purpose and function of the IPAB."}
