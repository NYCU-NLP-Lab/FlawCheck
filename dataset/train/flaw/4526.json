{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence and sources to support the assertion that Democrats have officially announced plans to abolish ICE if they win the 2020 election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statements and opinions of some left-leaning media outlets, immigrant rights advocates, and a former spokesman for Hillary Clinton's campaign represent the official stance of the Democratic Party.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Senator Kamala Harris, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, has expressed support for the existence of ICE.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Democrats have announced plans to abolish ICE, as it only provides limited examples of individuals calling for its end without concrete evidence of an official party stance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the calls to abolish ICE are not part of the official Democratic Party platform but rather the opinions of specific individuals and groups within the party.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the story it is based on includes contradictory information and lacks named sources, thereby undermining its credibility.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a misleading headline that does not align with the content of the article, which weakens its overall argument."}
