{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the issue by stating that only 25 percent of Texas high school students graduate prepared for college or careers. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual percentage is slightly higher, with 32 percent of Texas test-takers not meeting any of the benchmarks.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a complete picture of the situation. The expert's verdict highlights that 68 percent of students hit at least one benchmark, suggesting that a significant portion of Texas high school graduates are not completely unprepared for college or careers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that only 25 percent of Texas high school students graduate prepared for college or careers. The expert's verdict provides data from the ACT report, but it also presents alternative measures and perspectives on college readiness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations regarding the factors that contribute to college readiness. The expert's verdict mentions that the benchmarks are based on actual grades earned in college by ACT-tested students, suggesting that there may be other factors beyond the ACT test scores that determine college readiness."}
