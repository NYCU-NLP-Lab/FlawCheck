{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Walker's sons were targeted on Facebook by out-of-state protesters. The evidence provided only includes one message from a single individual, which may not be representative of a widespread targeting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Walker's sons were specifically targeted on Facebook. The only evidence provided is a single message from one individual.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the message from Miles Kristan on Facebook was a targeted attack on Walker's son, without considering alternative interpretations or motivations behind the message.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the message posted by Miles Kristan on Facebook, such as a general criticism of Walker rather than a targeted attack on his son.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing more specific details or examples of the alleged targeting of Walker's sons on Facebook. The lack of additional evidence weakens the claim's credibility.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact or severity of the targeting on Facebook. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the true extent of the targeting.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction with established facts in the claim. However, the lack of supporting evidence and specific details raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
