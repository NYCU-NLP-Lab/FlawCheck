{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the comparison between what students pay for tuition and what they spend on cellphones. It is unclear if the average student in Florida actually spends more on cellphones than on tuition.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between tuition costs and cellphone expenses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average student in Florida spends a significant amount on cellphones, which may not be true for all students.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the perceived similarity between tuition costs and cellphone expenses, such as the availability of financial aid or scholarships that reduce out-of-pocket tuition expenses for many students.", "Contradict fact": "The claim initially states that students pay more for cellphones than for tuition, but later mentions that most in-state students receive scholarships, grants, and other financial aid, which reduces their out-of-pocket expenses for tuition.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual cost of tuition by comparing it to cellphone expenses, which could be relatively low for some students.", "Falters at times": "The claim includes incorrect information about Florida's tuition ranking, indicating that the speaker may not have accurate knowledge or may make mistakes in their statements."}
