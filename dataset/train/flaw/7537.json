{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the insect pandemic by stating that once bitten by the Asian giant hornet, a person dies immediately. This is not supported by factual evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the assertion of a deadly insect pandemic occurring alongside COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between the Asian giant hornets and the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a problematic assumption as there is no scientific evidence to support such a connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photo, as it was originally published in 2013 in relation to a series of hornet attacks in China, rather than being directly related to a current deadly insect pandemic."}
