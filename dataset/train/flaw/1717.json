{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that multiple BJP candidates received an identical number of votes, implying that this is highly unusual and unlikely without EVM rigging.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that multiple BJP candidates received the same number of votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that identical vote counts for BJP candidates on multiple seats indicate EVM rigging, without considering alternative explanations or factors that could lead to similar vote counts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict states that the claim is false and provides evidence from the election commission website showing that each BJP candidate in the mentioned constituencies had a unique number of votes, refuting the claim of identical vote counts."}
