{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her allies by stating that they \"blocked\" a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, when in fact they initially opposed a draft of the resolution but later voted for a revised version that passed by a wide margin.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or details to back up the assertion that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies blocked the resolution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies' opposition to the initial draft of the resolution equates to blocking it, without considering the subsequent revisions and their support for the final version.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies had concerns about the initial draft of the resolution and sought to include condemnations of other types of bigotry, not just anti-Semitism."}
