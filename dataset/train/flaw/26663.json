{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that Mike Pence said he doesn't like to use the scientific term \"homo sapiens\" because it's \"unnecessarily sexual.\" The only source provided is a satirical blog, which is not a reliable source of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mike Pence's alleged refusal to use the term \"homo sapiens\" is due to it being \"unnecessarily sexual.\" However, this assumption is not supported by any factual evidence and is based on a fictional account.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Mike Pence's alleged refusal to use the term \"homo sapiens,\" such as personal preference, linguistic style, or a misunderstanding of the term's meaning. However, without further evidence or statements from Pence himself, it is difficult to determine the exact reasoning behind his alleged statement."}
