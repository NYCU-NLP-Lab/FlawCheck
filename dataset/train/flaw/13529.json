{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of street gang members in Chicago that are working with Mexican drug cartels. Experts are skeptical about linking cartels to an estimated 100,000 street gang members in the city.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct and significant partnership between Mexican drug cartels and street gang members in Chicago, which experts question.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts raise alternative explanations for the presence of Mexican drug cartels in Chicago, such as the city's location, large Mexican population, and high street gang activity, rather than solely attributing it to a partnership with 100,000 gang members."}
