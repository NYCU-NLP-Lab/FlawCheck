{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that parents cannot visit COVID-19 infected children in hospitals in Canada, when in fact, there are exceptions and allowances made for pediatric patients in different provinces.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the restrictions and precautions put in place by hospitals to limit the spread of COVID-19, such as restricting visitors and requiring self-isolation for those in close contact with COVID-positive individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that parents cannot visit COVID-19 infected children in hospitals in Canada.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that parents not being able to visit their infected children in hospitals is a widespread and general rule across all of Canada, which is not accurate as different provinces have different policies and exceptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that hospitals have implemented restrictions on visitors to protect both patients and staff from potential COVID-19 transmission."}
