{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the power of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) by suggesting that it can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments in order to fund wasteful spending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of the IPAB is to fund more wasteful spending, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that the IPAB can actually ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that IPAB recommendations would not apply to any particular individual, but would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the creation of the IPAB, such as the need to address the increasing costs of Medicare."}
