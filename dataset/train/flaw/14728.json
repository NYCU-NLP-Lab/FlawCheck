{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the percentage of Americans who earn the minimum wage. The expert's analysis shows that approximately 2.6 percent of all American workers earned the minimum wage in 2012, which is slightly higher than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to back up the assertion that only 2 percent of Americans earn the minimum wage. The expert's analysis relies on a study published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide more accurate statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising the minimum wage could lead to job cuts without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption. The expert's analysis does not address this specific bias, but it is implied in the context of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Sen. Rob Portman may falter in accuracy when it comes to the percentage of Americans earning the minimum wage. The expert's analysis highlights that Portman's estimate was slightly lower than the actual percentage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why individuals earn the minimum wage, such as their age or the nature of their employment. The expert's analysis mentions that a significant proportion of minimum wage workers are young people and part-time workers."}
