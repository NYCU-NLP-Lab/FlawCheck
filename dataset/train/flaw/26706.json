{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated because it states that nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their jobs since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the difference in the number of unemployed people is 13,933, which suggests that the claim may have exaggerated the number slightly.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any evidence or specific data to back up the statement that 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their jobs. The expert's verdict mentions that the number of unemployed people increased by about 14,000 since Governor Walker took office, but it does not clarify how many of those individuals lost their jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the increase in the number of unemployed people is solely due to Governor Walker and the Republicans taking over in January. However, the expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear what portion of the 14,000 people became unemployed because they lost their jobs. Therefore, the claim's assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in the number of unemployed people. It mentions that some people may be out of work and have given up looking, which could contribute to the overall unemployment numbers. This suggests that there may be alternative factors influencing the job loss in Wisconsin."}
