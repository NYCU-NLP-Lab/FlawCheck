{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Fred Trump was \"arrested participating in KKK riot\" in 1927, when the evidence suggests that he was discharged and the extent of his involvement is unclear.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that Fred Trump actively participated in the KKK riot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Fred Trump's arrest at the KKK riot implies his participation, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Fred Trump may have been arrested for refusing to disperse from the parade, rather than actively participating in the KKK riot."}
