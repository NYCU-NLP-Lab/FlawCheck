{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marlboro is giving away free cartons of cigarettes to Facebook users who like and share a post. However, there is no credible evidence or official confirmation to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or credible sources to verify the validity of the offer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the offer is a scam or fraudulent attempt to gather personal information from Facebook users.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Marlboro did not maintain any social media accounts and their official website was locked to registered users only, making it unlikely for them to create promotions on Facebook.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information about the alleged offer, as it is not supported by official sources or credible evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the offer by stating that Marlboro is giving away a limited number of free cartons, without providing any concrete proof or details about the offer."}
