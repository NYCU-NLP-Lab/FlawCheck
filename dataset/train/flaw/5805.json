{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money spent on cleaning up human waste and drug paraphernalia in San Francisco by stating that the entire $72.5 million budget was solely used for this purpose, when in fact it includes various other street cleaning activities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that there are more drug users on the public needle program in San Francisco than high school graduates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of money spent on street cleaning in San Francisco is directly related to the cleaning of human waste and drug paraphernalia, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in street cleaning budget, such as the overall growth and development of the city, which could contribute to the rise in reported excrement on sidewalks."}
