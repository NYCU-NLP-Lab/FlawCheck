{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump has completely removed white supremacists from the government's terror watch list when in fact, the program has not been officially changed and white supremacy extremist groups are still listed as threats in other counter-terrorism programs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading headline from an alternative media website and does not provide concrete evidence or official announcements to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that President Trump's focus on countering Islamic extremism means that he has removed white supremacists from the terror watch list. However, the focus on one form of extremism does not necessarily mean the exclusion of others.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim which is that the proposed change in the counter-extremism program would only affect a specific program, Countering Violent Extremism (CVE), and not the entire \"Terror Watch Program.\" This alternative explanation suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate."}
