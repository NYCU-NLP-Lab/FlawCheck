{"Understate": "The claim may understate the graduation rate by stating that \"one out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma\" without considering alternative measures such as students who take longer than four years to graduate or those who obtain equivalents like a GED.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that \"half of our kids don't graduate\" in major cities across America.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graduation rate is the same in major cities across America without providing evidence or considering potential variations in different cities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lower graduation rates, such as socioeconomic factors or educational policies, which are not addressed in the claim."}
