{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Nicole Galloway's campaign is being supported by extremists who want to defund the police. While there is evidence of one organization encouraging donations to her campaign, there is no evidence of actual contributions from groups that openly support defunding the police.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Galloway's campaign is being \"bankrolled\" by extremists who want to defund the police. The expert's analysis of Galloway's campaign finance reports found no contributions from such groups.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct connection between Galloway's campaign and groups that want to defund the police. However, the expert's analysis only found evidence of one organization encouraging donations to her campaign, without any actual contributions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation for the claim, suggesting that the purpose of the attack ads is to connect Galloway to groups supporting defunding the police, even if there is no direct financial support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Galloway's campaign finance reports do not show any contributions from groups openly supporting defunding the police. This contradicts the assertion made in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the lack of evidence supporting the assertion that Galloway's campaign is being funded by extremists who want to defund the police. The expert's analysis found no contributions from such groups, suggesting a lack of support for the claim."}
