The expert's verdict questions whether this assumption is valid and explores alternative solutions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a specific number of layoffs will occur. The expert's verdict raises questions about the evidence and whether the claim is supported by facts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations or solutions to address the budget deficit, rather than solely relying on layoffs. This implies that the claim may not consider other possibilities or options."}
