{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of the discounts offered by MyPillow using codes like \"QAnon,\" \"Q,\" and \"Storm.\" While the claim states that discounts were offered, it does not provide any information about the magnitude of these discounts or how significant they were in relation to the overall pricing of the products.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that MyPillow offered discounts using codes like \"QAnon,\" \"Q,\" and \"Storm.\" Although journalists and Twitter users reported this, the claim does not provide any direct evidence such as screenshots or official statements from MyPillow.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of codes like \"QAnon,\" \"Q,\" and \"Storm\" during checkout on MyPillow's website is directly linked to the conspiracy theory and not just a coincidence or unrelated to the conspiracy theory.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the use of codes like \"QAnon,\" \"Q,\" and \"Storm\" during checkout on MyPillow's website. It assumes that these codes are directly related to the conspiracy theory, but there could be other reasons for their use, such as marketing strategies or unrelated references.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the impact of the backlash faced by MyPillow after the Capitol riots. While it mentions that major companies dropped MyPillow's products, it does not provide further details or context about the extent of the backlash and its potential impact on the company.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the use of the promo code \"QAnon\" was no longer available on MyPillow's website at the time of the investigation. This contradicts the initial assertion that discounts were offered using this code.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the biases present. It jumps between different pieces of information without providing a cohesive argument or addressing all potential biases."}
