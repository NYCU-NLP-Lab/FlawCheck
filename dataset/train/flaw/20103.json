{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which health insurance plans cover Viagra but not birth control medication. The expert's verdict states that the claim is wrong to say that \"many\" plans have this discrepancy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a significant disparity in coverage between Viagra and birth control medication in health insurance plans. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that the majority of employer-purchased insurance plans cover a full range of contraceptive methods.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there are many health insurance plans that cover Viagra but not birth control medication. The expert's verdict presents data from the Guttmacher Institute and statements from insurance industry representatives that contradict the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that large companies that are self-insured may have different benefit plans and are regulated by federal, not state laws. This suggests that the coverage disparity may exist in some cases due to specific employer policies, rather than a widespread issue with health insurance plans."}
