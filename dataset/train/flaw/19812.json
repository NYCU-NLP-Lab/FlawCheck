{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of contributions that came from PACs and groups, as the expert's analysis shows that about 24 percent of Fallone's receipts came from PAC contributions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the majority of contributions were from private individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to Fallone's claim, as Roggensack also had a low percentage of contributions from PACs and groups, indicating that it may be common for judicial candidates in Wisconsin to receive a majority of contributions from private individuals."}
