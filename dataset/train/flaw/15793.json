{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Febreze and other Procter & Gamble products contain undeclared peanut and tree nut oils or byproducts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that P&G puts peanut and tree nut oil in their products without disclosing it on their packaging, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the child's reaction to Febreze could have been caused by other factors, such as the child's recent strep throat, rather than the alleged presence of nut oils in the product.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risk to individuals with nut allergies by not providing enough evidence or details about the alleged presence of nut oils in the products.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information, as some sources provide conflicting and unconfirmed information about the safety of fragranced P&G products for individuals with peanut allergies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ingredient lists published by P&G in 2013 and 2014 stated that peanut oil and other nut derivatives were among the compounds used in fragrancing their products.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the risk posed by Febreze and other P&G products by making broad assertions without sufficient evidence or support."}
