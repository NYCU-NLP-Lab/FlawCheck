{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the stance of Democrats by stating that they \"don't want money\" to go to the Florida Panhandle for Hurricane Michael aid. This is an oversimplification of the partisan battle over disaster aid dollars.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by suggesting that Democrats are solely responsible for the delay in hurricane disaster money for northwest Florida, without considering the role of other factors such as negotiations over funding for Puerto Rico.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the accusation that Democrats do not want money to go to the Florida Panhandle. It only provides statements from President Trump, without presenting comprehensive evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the partisan battle over disaster aid is solely about how much to give Puerto Rico, without acknowledging other potential factors or considerations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the delay in hurricane disaster money, such as differing priorities or negotiations between different political parties."}
