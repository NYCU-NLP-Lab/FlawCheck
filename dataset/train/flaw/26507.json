{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the performance of New Jersey's public school students by stating that they have the best Advanced Placement scores in the nation. While they do have high scores, it is unclear if they are the absolute best.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement scores in the nation. It only cites 2010 data and does not provide a comparison with other states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having the highest average AP test score in New Jersey automatically means having the best scores in the nation, without considering other states' performances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The College Board spokesperson mentions that comparing states' performance may not be accurate due to differences in population and demographics. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim's assertion of New Jersey having the best scores may not be entirely valid."}
