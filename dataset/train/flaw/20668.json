{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the association between Corona beer and the coronavirus on sales. The expert's verdict suggests that there is little or no evidence to support the claim that consumers were significantly shunning Corona beer due to the mistaken association.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that sales of Corona beer dropped sharply in early 2020 because of the association with the new coronavirus. The expert's verdict indicates that the evidence provided, such as a survey conducted by a PR firm, does not convincingly support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that consumers mistakenly associated the brand name Corona with the new coronavirus and that this led to a drop in sales. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there is little evidence to support this assumption and that other factors, such as the general dampening of public activities in China due to the spread of the coronavirus, may have contributed to sales slumps in multiple beer brands.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the drop in sales of Corona beer, such as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak coinciding with Chinese New Year celebrations and the overall slump in demand in China. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the drop in sales was primarily due to the mistaken association between Corona beer and the coronavirus.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the factors influencing sales of Corona beer. The expert's verdict highlights the multiple factors at play, including the timing of Chinese New Year celebrations, the overall impact of the coronavirus outbreak on public activities, and the general sales slump in multiple beer brands.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the drop in sales of Corona beer was not solely attributed to the mistaken association with the coronavirus. The expert's verdict presents evidence that suggests the drop in sales was part of a broader trend affecting multiple beer brands in China.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and accurate representation of the reasons behind the drop in sales of Corona beer. The expert's verdict highlights the misinterpretation and misleading reporting by news outlets, indicating that the claim may not fully capture the complexity of the situation."}
