{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential risk to the vote-by-mail system if Buehler were elected. It presents the scenario as a certainty rather than a possibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Buehler's election would put the vote-by-mail system at risk without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to demonstrate that Buehler has a genuine intention to undermine the vote-by-mail system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Buehler's concerns about the integrity of the vote-by-mail process, such as a desire to improve it rather than dismantle it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting statements from Buehler, where he denies wanting to end vote-by-mail but expresses concerns about the process.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential validity of Buehler's concerns about the integrity and privacy of the vote-by-mail system."}
