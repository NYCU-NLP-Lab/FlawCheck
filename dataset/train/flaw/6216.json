{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the scientific development by stating that Dutch scientists have created glow-in-the-dark trees. In reality, scientists have only inserted genes into plants that create a faint glow, and glowing trees remain theoretical.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough scientific evidence or support to prove the existence of glow-in-the-dark trees created by Dutch scientists. The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that the claim is based on confused and overhyped reporting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the genetic material from fireflies inserted into trees can make them \"eco-friendly outdoor nightlights.\" However, there is no sufficient evidence or explanation provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Dutch scientists are not responsible for locating and isolating the gene that makes fireflies able to glow. The Dutch connection mentioned in the claim is an artist and designer named Daan Roosegaarde who did not actually conduct the scientific research.", "Understate": "The claim understates the limitations and modesty of the glowing effect in the plants created by Bioglow, a company mentioned in the expert's verdict. The claim presents the glow-in-the-dark effect as more significant than it actually is.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that the idea of using glowing trees as street lamps was inspired by the work of former professor Alexander Krichevsky and his company Bioglow, rather than Dutch scientists directly creating glow-in-the-dark trees."}
