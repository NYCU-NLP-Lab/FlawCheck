{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"all of the science and data\" support the safety of having teachers and students in the classroom, when in fact, not all major studies agree with this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or references to the studies and data that supposedly support the safety of reopening schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if K-12 schools adhere to mitigation measures, there is minimal risk of COVID-19 transmission from schools. This assumption may not be universally accepted or supported by all studies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or viewpoints that may argue against the safety of reopening schools, such as the potential for increased transmission among students and teachers."}
