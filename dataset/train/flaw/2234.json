{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Democrats only delivered tax hikes in the 1980s, as there were bipartisan efforts at cutting spending as well.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that Democrats only delivered tax hikes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Democrats' promises of spending cuts were not fulfilled, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the bipartisan Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act in the 1980s allowed for both spending cuts and tax increases, involving Democrats in the effort to reduce the deficit."}
