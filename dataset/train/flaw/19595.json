{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Texas \"school systems\" lose 45 days a year on testing lacks sufficient evidence to support it. The sources provided by Dewhurst's spokesman did not explain the basis for the 45-day figure, and previous fact-checking on a similar claim found no evidence to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reducing the number of end-of-course exams from 15 to 5 will significantly reduce the number of days lost to testing. However, the claim does not provide evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of days lost to testing in Texas \"school systems.\" The expert's verdict mentions a minimum of 22 STAAR/TAKS test days and a maximum of 36, which suggests that the actual number of testing days could be higher than the claim implies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and supported statement about the number of days lost to testing in Texas \"school systems.\" The lack of conclusive evidence and conflicting information from different sources suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate or reliable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of days lost to testing in Texas \"school systems.\" It does not explore other factors that may contribute to the amount of time spent on testing, such as preparation, administration, and review of test results."}
