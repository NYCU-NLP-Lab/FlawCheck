{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that free abortion pills will be pushed on \"all students\" across the state, when in reality the bill only applies to public state universities and their student health centers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that California lawmakers are planning to push free abortion pills on all students.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed policy is \"super progressive\" without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the bill aims to mandate access to medication abortion on public state university campuses, rather than pushing free abortion pills on all students across the state."}
