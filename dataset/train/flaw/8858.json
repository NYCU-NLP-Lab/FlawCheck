{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the virus by stating that it is \"deadly\" to dogs, without providing specific data on the mortality rate or overall impact on the canine population.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the virus's spread by only mentioning seven states where it has been confirmed, without providing a comprehensive overview of its nationwide distribution.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that the virus is spreading in the canine population of the U.S. It provides limited information on isolated outbreaks in certain states, but does not provide a broader analysis of its prevalence or impact.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the virus is spreading solely within the canine population, without considering the possibility of other reservoirs or sources of infection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the spread of the virus, such as potential vectors or factors contributing to its transmission."}
