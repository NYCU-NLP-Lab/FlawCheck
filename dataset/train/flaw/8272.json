{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Fox Sports cancels all NFL broadcasts until players respect the flag, when in fact they continued to broadcast games on the specified date.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or official statement from Fox Sports to back up the assertion that they would cancel all NFL broadcasts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that players kneeling during the national anthem is a sign of disrespect towards the flag, which is a subjective interpretation and not universally agreed upon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Fox Sports did broadcast NFL games on the specified date, despite the assertion that they would cancel all broadcasts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information that can confuse readers, such as linking to footage from Fox News Channel discussing the row between the president and the league, which is not directly related to the claim itself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is a satirical work of fiction, as indicated by the footer note on the website where it was published and the site's disclaimer that presents fiction as fact."}
