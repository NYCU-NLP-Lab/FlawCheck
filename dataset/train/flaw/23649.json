{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of Harsh Mander in instigating violence during the anti-CAA protests. The provided evidence includes statements from individuals accusing Mander of being a \"white collared paid terrorist\" and instigating violence, but it does not provide concrete evidence or proof of his involvement in such activities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Harsh Mander instigated violence during the anti-CAA protests. The evidence provided includes statements from individuals and a video of Mander speaking, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or factual information that directly links Mander to the instigation of violence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mander's speech and statements indicate his intention to instigate violence during the protests. However, this assumption is subjective and open to interpretation. Mander's statements can be seen as expressing frustration and advocating for peaceful protests and legal action rather than promoting violence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Mander's statements were taken out of context or misinterpreted by those accusing him of instigating violence. Without further evidence or context, it is difficult to determine the true intentions behind Mander's words."}
