{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of criminal aliens released by the Obama administration by stating that 134,000 were released in just the past two years, while the expert's verdict provides evidence of only about 66,000 released criminals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the released criminal aliens will commit more crimes, victimizing innocent Americans. However, the expert's verdict states that this assumption is based on a study from 2005 and does not provide any current evidence to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that 134,000 criminal aliens were released by the Obama administration. The expert's verdict mentions that the source of this number is not clear and the questions raised about it were not answered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the release of criminal aliens, stating that approximately 45% of the releases were the result of court orders, not administration policy. This alternative explanation suggests that the administration may not be solely responsible for the release of these individuals.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the number of criminal aliens released by the Obama administration. The expert's verdict points out the discrepancy between the claim and the actual numbers provided by ICE data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama administration released about 66,000 convicted criminal aliens, not the claimed 134,000. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Center for Immigration Studies and the House Judiciary Committee to support this lower number.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim."}
