{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Marilyn Mosby posted and then deleted a picture showing her daughter in the ballot booth. The expert's verdict mentions that the image was circulated online and in news reports, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marilyn Mosby's action of posting and deleting the picture violated voting regulations. While the expert's verdict mentions that Maryland state election regulations prohibit the use of cell phones or cameras at polling locations, it does not explicitly state that Mosby's actions violated these regulations. It is an assumption based on the mention of the regulations and the deletion of the picture.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Marilyn Mosby's actions. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations for why Mosby posted and then deleted the picture. It only mentions that the picture violated voting regulations, but there could be other reasons for her actions that are not explored in the provided information."}
