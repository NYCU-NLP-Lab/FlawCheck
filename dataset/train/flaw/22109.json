{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Rep. Lauren Boebert took a photo with rioters on a tour of the Capitol on Jan. 5. The provided evidence suggests that the photo was taken in December 2019 at the Colorado State Capitol in Denver, and Boebert denies giving any Capitol tours to insurrectionists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo of Boebert with a group of people, some of whom allegedly made white supremacist hand gestures, is evidence of her involvement with the insurrectionists. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation that the individuals in the photo were actually involved in the attack on the Capitol.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo was not taken at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 5, as originally claimed. It was taken in December 2019 at the Colorado State Capitol.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting false information and making inaccurate accusations against Rep. Lauren Boebert, which have been refuted by her office and other sources.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Rep. Boebert's involvement or connection to the insurrectionists based on the limited evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the photo of Boebert with the group of people, such as it being a regular meeting or event unrelated to the insurrection.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the accusations and criticism faced by Rep. Boebert regarding her activity on Twitter during the riot and the subsequent calls for her resignation."}
