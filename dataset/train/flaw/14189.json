{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the attribution of the quote to Will Rogers. The quote is found in a reproduction of a card edited by Bryan Sterling, a Rogers expert, who died in 2008. The quote is also mentioned in a book titled \"Will Rogers' Daily Telegrams, Volume 3: The Hoover Years 1931-33.\" However, the claim does not provide direct evidence or verifiable sources to confirm the authenticity of the quote.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quote is authentic based on the curator of collections at the Will Rogers Museum & Birthplace Ranch stating that the quote is authentic. However, this assumption relies on the curator's expertise and may not be sufficient to establish the quote's authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim mentions that Rogers was taking a jab at \"technocracy\" in his piece. This suggests that the quote may have been intended to criticize a specific movement or ideology rather than making a general statement about government spending.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the quote is often misattributed to Will Rogers. The expert's verdict mentions that the quote has been falsely attributed to Rogers and that it is another misattribution.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the quote by attributing it to Will Rogers, a well-known humorist and political commentator. This attribution could add weight and authority to the quote, potentially influencing the perception of its importance.", "Understate": "No significant biases of understating are evident in the provided claim."}
