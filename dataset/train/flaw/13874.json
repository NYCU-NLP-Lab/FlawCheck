{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Texas public schools that are rated as \"unacceptable.\" The expert's verdict states that there were 496 out of 8,526 schools (5.8%) rated as academically unacceptable in 2011, which is lower than the claim's statement of \"almost 500\" out of 8,000 schools.", "Understate": "The claim slightly understates the total number of campuses in Texas. The expert's verdict mentions that there were 8,526 campuses in 2011, while the claim states there are 8,000 public schools.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"almost 500\" schools in Texas are rated as \"unacceptable.\" The expert's verdict provides the actual numbers and sources, but the claim does not provide any specific source or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rating of \"unacceptable\" automatically means a school is failing and that transferring to private schools is the solution. However, the claim does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why schools may be rated as \"unacceptable\" or explore other potential solutions besides transferring to private schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in academically unacceptable campuses in 2011 was attributed to various factors, but the claim does not address these factors or alternative solutions."}
