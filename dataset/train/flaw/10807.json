{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"More Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote\" lacks enough support because the expert provides evidence that contradicts this claim. The expert mentions that over 2.4 million votes were cast in Tennessee in the 2012 election, which is a significant number compared to the number of hunting and fishing licenses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of hunting and fishing licenses is greater than the number of people who vote. However, this assumption is problematic because it does not consider factors such as voter turnout, eligibility to vote, and the renewal of licenses on a yearly basis.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that over 2.4 million votes were cast in Tennessee in the 2012 election, which suggests that the number of people who vote is higher than the number of hunting and fishing licenses.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of people who vote in Tennessee by suggesting that it is lower than the number of hunting and fishing licenses.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies on outdated data from 2003 and does not consider the most recent election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that the number of hunting and fishing licenses may include individuals from neighboring states who come to Tennessee for hunting and fishing purposes. This alternative explanation suggests that the number of licenses does not solely represent the number of Tennesseans who engage in these activities."}
