{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the United States \"stood alone\" in the war in Iraq, as there were actually 35 countries that supported the action.", "Understate": "The claim understates the level of international support the United States had in the war in Iraq by suggesting that the US had no support from other nations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that the United States \"stood alone\" in the war in Iraq.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the level of international support for the war in Iraq is solely determined by the number of nations involved, without considering the quality or significance of their support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that while the United States had support from some countries, it did not have the support of key allies like the United Kingdom."}
