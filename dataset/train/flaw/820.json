{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the trade imbalance with China by stating that the US is losing over $500 billion a year, whereas the actual trade deficit in 2014 was $343 billion, and it is expected to be larger in 2015 but not more than $500 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement of losing over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trade deficit with China is solely a loss for the US, without considering potential economic benefits or the complexities of international trade relationships.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) does not involve China, despite Trump's attempt to link it to the trade deficit with China.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or facts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing inconsistent figures for the trade deficit with China, with Trump mentioning both over $500 billion and almost $400 billion, without providing a clear and consistent value.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the trade deficit with China, such as the impact of global economic factors or trade policies."}
