{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that Texas added more than 6,600 miles of highway from 2001-2012, more than any other state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that Texas added the most highway miles compared to any other state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that adding highway miles directly impacts Texas' economic competitiveness and companies' ability to do business in the state without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Texas' increase in highway miles, such as population growth or infrastructure development, that are not considered in the claim."}
