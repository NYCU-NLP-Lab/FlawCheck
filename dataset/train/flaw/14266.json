{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that the average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old, which implies that the majority of minimum wage workers are in their mid-thirties.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that the average age of minimum wage workers is 35 years old.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average age of minimum wage workers is a significant factor in determining whether the minimum wage should be raised or not. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other relevant factors such as income inequality or the cost of living.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations to the claim, such as the fact that the average age of minimum wage workers could be influenced by a small number of older workers who earn the minimum wage, while the majority of minimum wage workers are younger individuals.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average age of minimum wage workers is not 35 years old, as stated by PolitiFact National's rating of Obama's similar claim as \"Mostly False.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide a clear distinction between the average age of all workers who would receive a raise from the boost to $10.10 and the average age of those currently making the minimum wage.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual average age of minimum wage workers, as it does not account for the possibility of older workers being more likely to earn above the minimum wage."}
