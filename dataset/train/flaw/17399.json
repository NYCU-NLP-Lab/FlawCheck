The video circulating on social media does not provide concrete proof of a terrorist being apprehended.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no additional evidence or official confirmation to validate the assertion that a terrorist was caught in Gaffar market. The video alone is not sufficient to establish the truth of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it could be a mock drill conducted by the police. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that a terrorist was actually apprehended.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the assertion of a terrorist being caught in Delhi is false. The expert provides evidence to support this contradiction, including the possibility of the video being a mock drill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of policemen escorting a man from a building's basement is evidence of a terrorist being caught. However, this assumption is problematic as it lacks sufficient evidence and confirmation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing concrete evidence or reliable information to support the assertion of a terrorist being caught in Gaffar market. The video and accompanying social media posts do not offer substantial proof.", "Understate": "There is no clear instance of understating bias in the provided claim."}
