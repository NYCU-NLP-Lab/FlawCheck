{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that there is \"no more estate tax\" is an exaggeration. The expert's verdict states that Trump tends to exaggerate his achievements, and this claim is no exception.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the statement that there is no more estate tax.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there was an estate tax before Trump took office, but it does not provide any context or evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump often goes beyond the facts when talking about his economic achievements, and this claim is an example of contradicting the fact that there is still an estate tax.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Trump is referring to his efforts to reduce the estate tax or his plans to eliminate it in the future, rather than stating that it no longer exists currently."}
