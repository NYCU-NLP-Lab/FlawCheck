{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"no one was taken into custody\" for feeding the homeless, but the expert's verdict mentions that citations were issued for non-compliance with the process enacted to ensure public health and safety. This suggests that the claim may exaggerate the situation by downplaying the enforcement actions taken.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that no one was taken into custody solely based on the absence of reports or evidence. However, the expert's verdict mentions that citations were issued, indicating that there were enforcement actions taken.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only presents a broad statement without providing specific evidence or sources to verify the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that while outdoor feeding is legal, a new city law regulates the activity, and citations were issued for non-compliance with the process enacted to ensure public health and safety. This suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the lack of reported custody.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that citations were issued for non-compliance with the process enacted to ensure public health and safety.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it presents a generalization that no one was taken into custody without considering the specific circumstances or potential exceptions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the situation by not acknowledging the enforcement actions taken through the issuance of citations."}
