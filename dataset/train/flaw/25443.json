{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Maxine Waters' statement by implying that she said Trump supporters are \"not welcome here\" and that \"we must welcome everyone who crosses our borders.\" Waters' comments were about Trump's Cabinet members and the separation of children at the Mexico border, not about Trump supporters in general.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence found in Google and Nexis news archives that Waters made the quoted statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that Waters' comments were directed at Trump supporters broadly, when in fact they were about Trump's Cabinet members and the immigration policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation by alluding to the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy on immigration, which led to the separation of children from their parents at the Mexico border. However, this does not support the claim's assertion about Waters' statements."}
