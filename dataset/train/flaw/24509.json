{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of debt growth by stating that it is \"more than $4 billion a day.\" The actual figures provided by the expert suggest that the daily debt growth is around $4.1 billion in 2010 and $3.6 billion in 2011.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific sources or evidence to support the statement that the debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day. It only cites Governor Rick Perry's book and a footnote referencing a Bloomberg news article, which does not directly support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the debt growth is solely attributed to the policies of the Obama administration, without considering other factors such as economic recessions or previous administrations' actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the debt growth, such as changes in economic conditions or global events that may impact the national debt."}
