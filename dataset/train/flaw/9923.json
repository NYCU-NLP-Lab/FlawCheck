{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who have given up hope when it comes to finding a job. The expert's analysis shows that there were 1.1 million discouraged workers in November, not nearly 315,000 as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that nearly 315,000 Americans have given up hope in finding a job.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in discouraged workers is solely due to job-killing tax increases and the failure of the Obama administration's policies. This assumption is problematic as there could be various factors contributing to the increase in discouraged workers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in discouraged workers, such as changes in the job market, economic factors, or personal circumstances of individuals.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a misleading picture of the job market and the number of discouraged workers. The expert's analysis shows that while there were fewer discouraged workers compared to the previous year, their ranks had grown from the previous month.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the government does track and publish data on discouraged workers. The expert's analysis confirms that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks and reports on the number of discouraged workers each month."}
