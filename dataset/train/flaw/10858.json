{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decline in cases in Oklahoma, stating that it has \"declined precipitously,\" while the expert's analysis shows that it was only a modest decline.", "Understate": "The claim understates the rise in cases in Oklahoma in June, which the expert's analysis indicates has consistently increased and reached higher levels than at any point in the pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Oklahoma has flattened the curve, as the expert's analysis shows a different trend in daily case counts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Oklahoma's response to the pandemic has been successful based on the decline in cases, but the expert's analysis suggests that this is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in cases, such as the implementation of social distancing measures or other factors that may have contributed to the trend."}
