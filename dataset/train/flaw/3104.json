{"Exaggerate": "The claim of discretionary spending increasing by 84 percent is an exaggeration, as the actual increase is 24 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the numbers provided by Ryan and his colleagues do not accurately reflect the increase in discretionary spending.", "Problematic assumption": "Ryan's inclusion of the stimulus package in the 2010 totals, even though it was approved in 2009, leads to a problematic assumption and misrepresentation of the two-year trend under Obama.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that if the stimulus package is included in the correct year (2009), the two-year trend under Obama shows a roller-coaster ride of increase and decrease in discretionary spending."}
