{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the attack on the police headquarters by stating that the police were fleeing and that many were feared dead, when in reality only one officer was injured and the target of the raid was not breached.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a false image that has been digitally altered. The original photo shows a different context and does not support the claim of an attack on the police headquarters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the image used in the claim is from a protest in Nigeria's capital city Abuja, not an attack on the police headquarters. The false claim is attributed to a Facebook page that supports the secession of Biafra and spreads misinformation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used as evidence has been altered and does not accurately represent the situation it claims to depict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the image is evidence of an attack on the police headquarters without verifying the authenticity or context of the image.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting false information and relying on a digitally altered image as evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim."}
