{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence or news stories confirming the crucifixion of a Christian in Iraq or elsewhere. The claim lacks enough support to prove the occurrence of crucifixions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ISIS is currently crucifying Christians in Iraq without providing any concrete evidence or proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Christians, along with people of other faiths, have been in the crossfire of the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. This suggests that the persecution of Christians may be a result of the ongoing conflicts rather than a deliberate act of crucifixion by ISIS.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no evidence or confirmation of crucifixions of Christians in Iraq or elsewhere.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the situation by using the word \"literally\" to describe the crucifixions, implying that they are happening exactly as described, but the expert's verdict suggests otherwise.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that Christians are being crucified \"right now\" in Iraq, without providing sufficient evidence to support this statement.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Cruz's office did not provide any evidence when asked about the crucifixions. This suggests that the claim may falter in terms of providing verifiable information."}
