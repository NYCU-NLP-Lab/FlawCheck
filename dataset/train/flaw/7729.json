{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to prove that Philando Castile was a member of the Crips gang. The evidence provided by the disreputable website is based on innuendo and unrelated photographs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Philando Castile's alleged membership in the Crips gang is a relevant factor in his death during a police stop, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the mugshot presented as evidence of Castile's gang membership was actually taken during a previous arrest related to a traffic violation, not a gang-related crime.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of minor traffic violations in portraying Castile as a gang member. The multiple traffic stops and citations do not necessarily indicate gang affiliation.", "Understate": "The claim understates the dismissals of more than half of Castile's traffic violations, which suggests that he may not have been an exceptionally bad driver, but rather potentially targeted by officers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the repeated traffic stops, such as racial profiling or targeting of black motorists by law enforcement officers."}
