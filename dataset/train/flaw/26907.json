{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Rep. Pittenger's liberal rating by stating that he is \"constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.\" The provided evidence only mentions one rating from Conservative Review, and it is unclear if other conservative watchdog groups consistently rate him as liberal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the statement that Rep. Pittenger is consistently rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress. The evidence only mentions one rating from Conservative Review, and it is unclear if other sources or ratings support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rating from Conservative Review is a reliable and accurate measure of Rep. Pittenger's liberal rating. However, the source is associated with a controversial radio personality and may have biased criteria for determining liberal ratings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Rep. Pittenger's rating, such as differing criteria or methodologies used by different conservative watchdog groups. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and presents the rating from Conservative Review as the sole basis for the claim."}
