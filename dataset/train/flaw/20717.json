{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of days Maggie Hassan was out of state by using the phrase \"out of state on 30 days over the last three months.\" The evidence suggests that she was out of state for a maximum of 40 percent of the time, which is not equivalent to 30 days.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that Maggie Hassan was out of state for 30 days over the last three months.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Maggie Hassan's travel, such as attending party meetings and fundraisers related to her campaign for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The claim may not consider these alternative explanations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being out of state for a certain number of days automatically implies a lack of commitment to her job as governor. This assumption may not take into account the possibility that Hassan may have been fulfilling other responsibilities related to her political campaign.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing consistent and accurate information about the number of days Maggie Hassan was out of state. The evidence suggests that the initial claim focused on April alone, but later clarified that she was out of state for a maximum of 40 percent of the time.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of time Maggie Hassan spent out of state by using a maximum of 40 percent, which is less than half of the time. However, this bias is not as prominent as the exaggeration bias mentioned earlier."}
