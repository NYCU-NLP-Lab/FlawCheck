{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them. The expert's analysis suggests that the number provided by the Civitas Institute may not accurately reflect the actual number of students on waitlists.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the number of 60,000 children on waiting lists. The expert's analysis questions the source and methodology used to estimate this number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 60,000 children on waiting lists are unable to access a school that works best for them. The expert's analysis highlights that some students may not have been placed on a physical waitlist but were simply not awarded scholarships or grants due to program caps.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the high number of children on waiting lists, such as program caps and eligibility criteria. This challenges the claim's implication that the waiting lists solely reflect a lack of school options.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of children on waiting lists by not accounting for all the different programs and funding sources mentioned in the expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear and comprehensive information about the various programs and their limitations, leading to potential misinterpretation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the number of students on waitlists is larger than the number of students in all but three of the state's school districts. The expert's analysis questions the accuracy and validity of this comparison."}
