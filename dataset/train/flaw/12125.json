{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that Donald Trump endorsed flag burning in February 2011, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that this claim is false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Donald Trump endorsed flag burning in February 2011.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tweet from February 2011, which allegedly endorsed flag burning, was genuine. However, the expert's verdict states that the tweet was faked and provides evidence to support this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discrepancy between Trump's stance on flag burning in 2011 and 2016. The expert's verdict suggests that the difference in engagement with Trump's tweets in 2011 compared to later years could be a factor."}
