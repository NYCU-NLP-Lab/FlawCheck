{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that J.B. Van Hollen \"knew about (the Ken Kratz sexting) case for nearly a year and did nothing about it.\" However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that Van Hollen's involvement was limited to the racy texts sent to Stephanie Van Groll in October 2009, and reports about texts to other women surfaced after the initial investigation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Van Hollen knew about the case for nearly a year and took no action. The expert's verdict explains the limited scope of Van Hollen's involvement and the timing of the revelations about the other women involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Van Hollen had a duty or responsibility to take action in the Ken Kratz sexting case. However, the expert's verdict does not indicate any specific legal obligation or requirement for Van Hollen to intervene.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that Van Hollen's inaction was due to negligence or indifference. However, the expert's verdict suggests that Van Hollen's involvement was limited to the specific texts sent to Stephanie Van Groll and that reports about other women surfaced later.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actions or steps that Van Hollen actually took in response to the Ken Kratz sexting case. The expert's verdict mentions that Van Hollen's Department of Justice conducted a criminal investigation of Kratz's sexting in October 2009, indicating some level of action taken by Van Hollen's office.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent accusation against Van Hollen. Initially, it asserts that he \"did nothing about it,\" but later clarifies that he did nothing \"substantive.\" This inconsistency weakens the claim's credibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Van Hollen's Department of Justice conducted a criminal investigation of Kratz's sexting in October 2009. The claim suggests that Van Hollen did nothing, while the expert's verdict provides evidence of some level of action taken by Van Hollen's office."}
