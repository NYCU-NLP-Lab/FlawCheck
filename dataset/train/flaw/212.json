{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it suggests that fish are swimming through the middle of the streets in Miami during high tide on a sunny day. While it is acknowledged that this is not a regular occurrence, there have been instances where fish have been seen in the streets during flooding events.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on anecdotal evidence and video footage, rather than comprehensive scientific data. Although some public officials and residents have reported seeing fish in the streets during flooding events, it is not clear how widespread or frequent these occurrences are.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the presence of fish in the streets during flooding events, such as the possibility of fish being washed into the streets from nearby bodies of water rather than actively swimming through them. This alternative explanation is not addressed in the provided information.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the occurrence of fish in the streets during flooding events by stating that it is not a regular occurrence. While it may not happen frequently, the fact that there have been multiple reported sightings and video evidence suggests that it is more than just a rare event.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it is challenged by skeptics who question the accuracy of the statement. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for example, expressed skepticism about the claim and stated that he had not witnessed such occurrences in Miami.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any established facts, as there have been reported sightings and video evidence of fish in the streets during flooding events. However, it may contradict the perception that fish swimming in the streets of Miami is a common occurrence."}
