{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the tribute by stating that ESPN omitted it from their pre-game coverage. It is possible that ESPN covered the tribute in some other way or at a different time during the broadcast.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that ESPN intentionally omitted the tribute. It only provides photographs and audience videos as evidence, which may not be sufficient to conclude that ESPN deliberately chose not to show the tribute.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ESPN omitted the tribute because they thought their commercials were more important. This assumption may not be accurate and lacks evidence to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why ESPN did not show the tribute, such as time constraints or other programming decisions. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
