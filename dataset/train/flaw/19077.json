{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the strong economy on middle-class income by stating that it rose to a \"record level\" without providing specific data or comparison to previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that middle-class income rose to a record level in 2017.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the strong economy is solely responsible for the rise in middle-class income without considering other factors such as changes in technology, demographics, or business cycles.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim attributes the rise in middle-class income to President Trump and Republican policies without considering other potential factors or contributions from previous administrations."}
