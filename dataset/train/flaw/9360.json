{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"50 million abortions since Roe v. Wade\" may be an exaggeration as it does not account for natural miscarriages and stillbirths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all aborted pregnancies would have resulted in live children, which is a problematic assumption as there is a natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to verify the exact number of abortions since Roe v. Wade.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of abortions, such as changes in societal attitudes towards abortion and access to contraception."}
