{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that Joe Biden explicitly said \"we can only re-elect Donald Trump.\" In reality, he stumbled in his speech and said, \"we can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the full context of Joe Biden's statement. It cuts off the video after the word \"Trump,\" eliminating the preceding context that helps explain Biden's sentence construction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a manipulated video created by President Trump's campaign. The video was debunked by fact-checkers and rated as \"Mostly False\" for deceptive editing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the manipulated video accurately represents Joe Biden's endorsement of Donald Trump. However, the video distorts his actual statement and misrepresents his intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Joe Biden was stumbling in his speech and meant to convey that if the Democratic Party engages in negative attacks during the primary, it could lead to the re-election of Donald Trump. This interpretation is supported by Biden's earlier statement in St. Louis where he made a clearer reference to not turning the primary into a campaign of negative attacks."}
