{"Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations imposed by the USA Freedom Act compared to the previous surveillance program. The expert's verdict mentions that the new law requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which could be seen as a limitation on their previous abilities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that there is nothing new that can be done under the USA Freedom Act. The expert's verdict provides some information about the changes in the law, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to fully support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the USA Freedom Act has not introduced any new capabilities or limitations compared to the previous program. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the changes in the law and the potential impact on government surveillance activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the USA Freedom Act may have introduced alternative methods or procedures for gathering data that were not available before. The expert's verdict mentions that the new law keeps the records in the hands of the phone companies, suggesting a different approach to data collection.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the USA Freedom Act has introduced changes to the government's ability to collect bulk data. The expert's verdict mentions that the new law respects civil liberties by stopping the automatic collection of bulk data and requires a warrant for access to suspected terrorist's call data.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more information or context. The expert's verdict does not provide any specific evidence of the claim faltering.", "Exaggerate": "It is difficult to determine if the claim exaggerates without more information or context. The expert's verdict does not provide any specific evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
