{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the changes made to the definition of domestic violence on the DOJ website. The expert's verdict highlights the significant changes, but the claim only mentions that the definition was changed without explanation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully understand the context and reasoning behind the change in the definition of domestic violence. The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to the Office of Violence Against Women for an explanation but received a response that did not adequately answer their questions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in the definition of domestic violence on the DOJ website was made without explanation. While the expert's verdict mentions that they did not receive a satisfactory explanation, it does not definitively state that there was no explanation given.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the change in the definition of domestic violence on the DOJ website. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either."}
