{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which personal-injury trial lawyers have funded the Texas Democratic Party. The expert's analysis shows that the actual percentage is 75.4% rather than the claimed \"over 80%.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on the analysis of the Texas Democratic Party's contribution and expenditure reports for a limited period (2006-2010). The expert's analysis does not cover the entire decade or include more recent data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of the accuracy of the timeframe mentioned. The expert points out that the claim should not have included the phrase \"for over a decade\" without checking the party's finance reports for 2002-2004.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that personal-injury trial lawyers are the primary funders of the Texas Democratic Party, without considering other potential sources of funding or the contributions from federal Democratic committees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative sources of funding for the Texas Democratic Party, such as contributions from other interest groups or individual donors. The expert's analysis only focuses on personal-injury trial lawyers' contributions."}
