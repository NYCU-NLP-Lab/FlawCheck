{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is an exaggeration as it states that 250,000 out of the 500,000 population growth in Texas came from the other 49 states, while the available data suggests a lower number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, states that there are no published figures on the state's population gains in 2010 due to migration from other states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the 250,000 people moving to Texas from other states may also include those from other countries, which is a common misunderstanding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the population growth in Texas is primarily due to migration from other states, without considering other factors such as natural population growth (births minus deaths) or international migration.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst falters at times as his prepared remarks state that more than 200,000 people moved to Texas from other states, while his actual speech claims 250,000.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the available data from the U.S. Census Bureau estimates, which suggest that the net migration from other states to Texas was 143,423 during a specific time period, not 250,000."}
