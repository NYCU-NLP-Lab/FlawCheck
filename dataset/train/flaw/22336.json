{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the CDC's update on COVID-19 mortality statistics by stating that only 6% of deaths were due to the coronavirus, while the remaining 94% were due to preexisting health conditions. This interpretation may be an exaggeration of the data provided by the CDC.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the CDC \"quietly updated\" its COVID-19 mortality statistics in summer 2020. It is important to evaluate the credibility and reliability of the sources and evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in reporting methods by the CDC was deceptive or intended to manipulate the data without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption. It is important to critically analyze the motivations and intentions behind the alleged actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the change in COVID-19 mortality statistics, such as improvements in data collection and reporting methods, updates in medical understanding of the virus, or changes in the classification of deaths related to COVID-19.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the widely reported information about COVID-19 deaths, which have been attributed to the coronavirus itself rather than solely preexisting health conditions. The claim suggests that the majority of reported deaths were not caused by the virus, which goes against the consensus of scientific and medical experts.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in presenting a clear and consistent narrative, as it includes statements from various sources and perspectives. This lack of coherence may raise questions about the reliability and accuracy of the information presented."}
