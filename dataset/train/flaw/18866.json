{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that \"snowflake\" was a Nazi term used to describe the remains of those who were incinerated during the Holocaust. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the education team at the Illinois Holocaust Museum have both stated their unfamiliarity with the term being used in that context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the term \"snowflake\" was used by Nazi soldiers during the Holocaust to refer to human remains. However, there is no historical evidence or reliable sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests an alternative explanation for the origin of the term \"snowflake\" as being from the 1999 movie Fight Club, where it was used in a derogatory manner. This suggests that the term may have originated in popular culture rather than having a Nazi origin.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the term \"snowflake\" was not included in the Holocaust Encyclopedia provided by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and it was never used in the manner described above in their archives.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent explanation for the origin of the term \"snowflake.\" It presents multiple possibilities without strong evidence to support any of them.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the lack of evidence and expert opinions that contradict the idea of \"snowflake\" being a Nazi term. It does not give enough weight to the authoritative sources that dismiss this claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
