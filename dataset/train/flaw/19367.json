{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that 90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted without providing enough evidence or sources to support this statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific sources or studies to back up the statement that 90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that a high percentage of babies with Down syndrome are aborted without considering other factors or reasons for abortion decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high abortion rate mentioned in the claim, such as the availability and accuracy of prenatal testing for Down syndrome, societal attitudes towards disability, or personal choices made by individuals and families.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on a single article from 2007 and does not provide more recent or comprehensive data on abortion rates for babies with Down syndrome."}
