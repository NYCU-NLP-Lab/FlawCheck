{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than the native born, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that immigrants are significantly less likely to be incarcerated compared to natives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it relies on the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study and research by the American Immigration Council, but it does not provide specific details or direct citations to these sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lower crime rates among undocumented immigrants, such as socioeconomic factors or differences in law enforcement practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes, which is perpetuated by some individuals who promote restrictive immigration policies.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as there is no evidence provided to suggest inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the extent to which undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes, as it is supported by research and expert opinions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that deporting undocumented immigrants is being considered as a crime reduction strategy, which may be a problematic assumption as there may be other motivations behind deportation policies."}
