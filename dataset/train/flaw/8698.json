{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Donald Trump's actions on offshoring jobs by stating that he \"let federal contractors double offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the underlying government data are not robust enough for firm conclusions.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that the government data used in the report relied upon by Biden's campaign is not robust enough to draw firm conclusions. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in offshoring jobs during Trump's first 18 months in office was solely due to his actions. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the report's focus was in response to Trump's efforts before he took office to prevent Carrier Corp. from sending jobs to Mexico. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in offshoring jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in offshoring jobs, such as factors that occurred before Trump took office.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the underlying government data used in the report are not robust enough for firm conclusions. This suggests that the claim may falter at times due to the limitations of the data.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or facts.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any specific facts or information."}
