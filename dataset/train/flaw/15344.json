{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Peter DeFazio votes with Nancy Pelosi 86 percent of the time is based on a cherry-picked selection of only 14 votes out of hundreds cast by DeFazio. This limited sample size does not provide enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting with Nancy Pelosi a certain percentage of the time is inherently negative or undesirable. It does not consider the context or reasoning behind those votes, making it a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for DeFazio's voting record, such as shared policy goals or alignment with the Democratic Party platform. It implies that voting with Pelosi is solely due to party loyalty, without exploring other possible reasons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nancy Pelosi, as speaker, does not vote much. The expert mentions that Pelosi has cast only 94 votes in the 111th Congress, which undermines the claim that DeFazio votes with her 86 percent of the time.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual percentage of votes that DeFazio has cast in alignment with Pelosi. The expert's investigation reveals that DeFazio has voted with the majority of his party 96.6 percent of the time, which is higher than the claimed 86 percent.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the influence and control that Nancy Pelosi has over Peter DeFazio's voting decisions. The expert mentions that DeFazio is not big on party politics or groupthink, suggesting that the claim may overstate Pelosi's influence on his voting patterns.", "Falters at times": "The expert points out that the ad's claim falters by using a limited selection of votes and ignoring the fact that Pelosi did not vote on some of the cherry-picked votes. This indicates a potential flaw in the claim's methodology and accuracy."}
