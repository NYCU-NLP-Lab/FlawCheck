{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in the femicide rate over the last five years. This bias is evident in the statement \"In the last year alone we\u2019ve lost more than 2,000 women\u2019s lives in the hands of men.\" It implies a significant increase in femicide without providing specific data or comparison to previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to validate the increase in the femicide rate. While it mentions statistics such as \"One in five women experience physical violence from an intimate partner\" and \"41% of the [124,000 cases of rape in the last three years] were against children,\" these statistics do not directly support the claim about the femicide rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the femicide rate has been increasing over the last five years without providing concrete data or evidence to support this assumption. It may be problematic to make such a claim without reliable and comprehensive data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in reported femicides. It does not explore factors such as changes in reporting mechanisms, improved awareness, or other societal changes that could influence the reported numbers."}
