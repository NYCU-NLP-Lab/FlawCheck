{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the risk posed by the New Guinea Flatworms to human health, as the expert's verdict states that the primary risks are to the ecosystem, not to human health.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that sightings of the New Guinea Flatworm should be reported to authorities by calling 911, as the expert's verdict states that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission does not recommend calling 911 to report their sightings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the invasion of New Guinea Flatworms in Florida is a recent event, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the species was first spotted in August 2012.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the New Guinea Flatworms primarily pose a risk to the ecosystem, rather than to human health, as stated in the expert's verdict."}
