{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that \"The NRA used to support expanded background checks.\" It relies on statements made by President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg, but there is no additional evidence provided to back up the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on statements made by political figures and may be influenced by their biases or political agendas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the NRA currently opposes expanded background checks, suggesting a change in their position over time. However, it does not provide enough evidence to conclusively prove this contradiction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the statements made by President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg. It is possible that they are referring to specific instances or statements made by NRA leaders, rather than a consistent and long-standing support for expanded background checks.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of support the NRA had for expanded background checks, as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the NRA's stance on the issue."}
