{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"We've started building the wall\" at the Mexico border is an exaggeration because the actual construction is limited to replacement barriers and some fencing, not a full-fledged wall.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the construction by implying that a significant portion of the wall has been built, when in reality, it is only a small fraction of the overall project.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide concrete evidence or specific details about the progress made in building the wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the replacement barriers and fencing can be equated to the wall promised by President Trump, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists that the construction mentioned in the claim is not representative of the wall that was promised, as it involves replacing existing barriers rather than building new ones."}
