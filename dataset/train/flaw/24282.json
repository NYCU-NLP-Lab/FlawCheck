{"Lack enough support": "The claim that most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook lacks enough support. The expert's verdict provides evidence from multiple polls that show a range of percentages, none of which indicate that Facebook is the main source of news for most Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the poll about where millennials get their news about politics and government can be generalized to all Americans. However, the expert's verdict explains that the poll specifically focused on millennials and cannot be used to make a broad claim about all Americans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative sources of news for Americans, such as TV, newspapers, and other social media platforms. This suggests that there are multiple sources that Americans use to get their news, rather than relying solely on Facebook."}
