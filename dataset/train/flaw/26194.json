{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of money that Sen. John McCain has taken from Wall Street by stating that he has taken more money than any other sitting senator. The expert's verdict mentions that McCain received more than $22 million from Wall Street, but it does not provide information on the campaign contributions of other sitting senators.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide information on the campaign contributions of other sitting senators, making it difficult to determine if McCain has indeed taken more money from Wall Street than any other sitting senator. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support to fully validate its statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that receiving money from Wall Street is inherently negative or problematic. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any analysis or context to support or challenge this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that McCain's campaign spokeswoman stated that the numbers are skewed because they include contributions made during the senator's 2008 presidential run. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not fully consider the context of McCain's campaign contributions from Wall Street."}
