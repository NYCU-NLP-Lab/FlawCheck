{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Tony Evers' stance on using tax dollars to pay for abortions by comparing it to tonsillectomies, which implies that he wants tax dollars to be used for all abortions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tony Evers believes tax dollars should pay for abortions, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the statement that Tony Evers said tax dollars should pay for abortions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of Tony Evers' statement, as he mentions the need to have Medicaid money available for all people without explicitly stating that tax dollars should pay for abortions."}
