{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Somali refugees resettled in Minnesota under President Obama by stating that 70,000 refugees were resettled, which is larger than the total number of Somali refugees resettled in the entire U.S. during that time period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the resettlement of Somali refugees in Minnesota was part of a planned effort to help elect Rep. Ilhan Omar.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes an unfounded assumption that the resettlement of Somali refugees in Minnesota was directly linked to Rep. Ilhan Omar's election, without providing any substantial evidence or logical reasoning.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of Somali refugees resettled in Minnesota under President Obama was significantly lower than the claimed 70,000. The actual number is 6,320 refugees.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of refugees who arrived in Minnesota from Somalia between 1979 and 2017, which is reported to be 23,915. The claim fails to acknowledge this larger number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Rep. Ilhan Omar's election, focusing solely on the resettlement of Somali refugees as the cause. Other factors such as campaigning, voter support, and political climate could also have played a role.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using erroneous information and inaccurate numbers to support its argument, which undermines its credibility."}
