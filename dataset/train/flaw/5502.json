{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the meme in discrediting Biden's victory by presenting the statistics as evidence of voter fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the meme discredits Biden's victory. The statistics provided in the meme are factual but do not indicate electoral fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistics in the meme can be used to discredit Biden's victory, without providing evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the statistics presented in the meme, such as population growth and higher voter turnout, which could explain the differences between Obama's and Biden's numbers."}
