{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of support for the stated priorities by stating that \"more than three-quarters\" of Americans hold these views. However, the expert's verdict confirms that the polls cited by the claim do show significant support for each of the three policy positions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific sources or data to support the percentages mentioned. However, the expert's verdict states that the polls cited by the claim do provide support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the stated priorities are representative of the overall priorities of Americans. The expert's verdict acknowledges that the claim accurately reflects the support for these policies among Americans, but it does not address whether these are the top priorities for the majority of Americans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the priorities of Americans. It simply presents the stated priorities as the main focus."}
