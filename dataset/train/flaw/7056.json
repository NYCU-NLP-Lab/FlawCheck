{"Exaggerate": "The claim that HEPA filters can \"eat any form of virus including coronavirus\" may be an exaggeration, as experts mention that there is still a risk of transmission from larger particles that are not caught by the filters.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of capturing larger particles generated when passengers cough, breathe, or speak, which are not caught by the filters.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by the fact that HEPA filters are able to remove \"virtually all viruses and bacteria\" from the air according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), there may be a lack of sufficient evidence or studies to fully support the claim that they can capture any form of virus, including coronavirus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of HEPA filters alone is enough to ensure complete protection against the transmission of viruses, without considering other factors such as the behavior of passengers or the effectiveness of other preventive measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the risk of transmission on airplanes, such as the behavior of passengers or the effectiveness of other preventive measures."}
