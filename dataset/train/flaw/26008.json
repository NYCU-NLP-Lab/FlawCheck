{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the announcement made by one law professor and his organization. It is unclear how many electors are actually on board with the plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that enough electors will vote against Trump to overturn the election results, but this assumption is questionable as only one Republican elector has publicly stated their intention to not vote for Trump.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the difficulty of convincing 37 electors to cast \"faithless\" votes and strip Trump of the victory. The expert's verdict suggests that the effort seems unlikely to be successful.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the law professor is working to take Trump's election win away. The expert's verdict mentions concerns about foreign involvement in the election and Trump's refusal to comply with constitutional limitations on foreign assets as reasons for this effort, but these are not the only possible explanations."}
