{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of American universities that no longer require history majors to take a single course in American history. The expert's verdict mentions that 70% of the top-ranked universities do not require it, suggesting a significant majority.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that \"the overwhelming majority\" of elite universities no longer require history majors to take American history.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of specific data or statistics to back up the statement about the requirement of American history courses for history majors in elite universities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the requirement of American history courses for history majors is essential or expected in elite universities, without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why history majors may not be required to take American history courses, such as the availability of specialized or focused courses in other regions or periods of history."}
