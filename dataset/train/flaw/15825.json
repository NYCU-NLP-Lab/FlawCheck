{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in pay between CEOs and workers by stating that CEOs earn 431 times what their workers earn, when more recent data suggests the ratio is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific sources or data to support the statement that CEOs now earn 431 times what their workers earn.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting unions is the solution to the perceived income disparity between CEOs and workers, without providing evidence or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore other potential factors that could contribute to the difference in pay between CEOs and workers, such as job responsibilities, qualifications, or market dynamics."}
