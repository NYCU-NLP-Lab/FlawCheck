{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Mitt Romney \"supervised a company guilty of massive Medicare fraud\" is an exaggeration because it implies that Romney was directly responsible for the fraud when the evidence suggests otherwise.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the accusation of Medicare fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's role as a director of the company automatically makes him responsible for any fraudulent activities, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by the Globe report, which states that prosecutors gave credit to Corning for exposing the fraud, not Romney.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Romney claimed to have uncovered the fraud, which was supported by the Globe report.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it presents a misleading and exaggerated statement but also includes some elements of truth, making it difficult to assess its accuracy.", "Understate": "None of the biases selected indicate an understatement in the claim."}
