However, the expert states that there is no official promotion or recognition of such code words by 911 organizations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that dispatchers are not trained to respond in a specific way when someone pretends to order a pepperoni pizza. The expert clearly states that this is not true.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential danger of using code words or signals to call for help. The expert mentions that if an aggressor recognizes the code word, it could elicit a violent response.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effectiveness of using a code word like ordering a pizza on 911 to convey distress. The expert states that instances where someone has dialed 911 and asked for a pizza or something similar have occurred but they have been highly publicized, indicating that they may be rare occurrences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that in Great Britain, a similar story was reported where the 911 respondent had to guess that the caller ordering pizza was in distress and then sent help. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations or interpretations for someone ordering a pizza on 911.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by spreading misinformation through social media platforms. The expert mentions that social media posts are often inaccurate, and it is important to remind people not to believe everything they read or hear in social forums."}
