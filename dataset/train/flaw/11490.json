{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of excess payments going to people who shouldn't get them. The expert's verdict states that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found $4.2 billion in refundable credits, not $4 billion as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the diversity of individuals who may receive these excess payments. The expert's verdict mentions that ITINs can be issued to both individuals living in the country illegally and those here legally, such as foreign workers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that the excess payments are mostly going to Mexicans. The expert's verdict mentions that the majority of ITIN filers are likely individuals living in the country illegally, but it also acknowledges that ITINs can be issued to individuals here legally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the excess payments are going to people who shouldn't get them solely based on their nationality. The expert's verdict clarifies that the payments were made to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States, but this includes both illegal immigrants and legal individuals without employment authorization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the excess payments, such as individuals who are here legally but do not have employment authorization. The expert's verdict mentions that ITINs can be issued to legal individuals, including foreign workers."}
