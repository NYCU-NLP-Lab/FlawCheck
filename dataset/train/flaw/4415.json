{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Barack Obama's health care law by stating that it \"will be the biggest job-killer ever.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide valid projections or evidence to back up the assertion that the health care law will be a significant job-killer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the government cannot buy health care cheaper than anyone else, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of independent reports and analyses, such as the CBO report, which states that the reduction in labor due to the health care law would only be \"roughly half a percent\" and not solely due to onerous regulation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for potential job impacts, such as the possibility that more people may seek jobs due to a Medicaid expansion under the law."}
