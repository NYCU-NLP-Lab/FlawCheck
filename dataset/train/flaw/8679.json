The expert's verdict mentions that Romney's tax rates were slightly below the national average, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that he pays less tax than the car elevator installers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney pays less tax than the people who installed his car elevators without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions Romney's tax rates but does not compare them to the tax rates of the car elevator installers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Mitt Romney pays less tax than the car elevator installers. The expert's verdict mentions Romney's tax rates, but it does not provide evidence or comparison to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide an alternative explanation to the claim."}
