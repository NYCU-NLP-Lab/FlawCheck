{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people outside the event by stating \"25,000 outside all to hear the POTUS speak!\" when it is uncertain how many people were actually outside.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that there were 25,000 people outside the event.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo used in the post is not from the event in question but from a different event in Cleveland.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the large crowd size outside the event is indicative of public support for the president and implies that it contradicts the idea of impeaching the president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the overflow space was not full and reporters outside the arena did not see a crowd nearing the claimed number of 25,000."}
