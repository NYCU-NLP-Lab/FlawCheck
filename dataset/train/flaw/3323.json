{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the dog named Captain slept next to his owner's grave for 7 years. The provided information only mentions the dog being found in the cemetery, but there is no concrete evidence or documentation to prove the duration or consistency of the dog's presence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the dog's presence in the cemetery is directly linked to his owner's grave and implies a deep emotional connection. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the dog may have been found in the cemetery by coincidence and that there is no evidence to support the assumption that the dog was intentionally sleeping next to his owner's grave.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the dog in the photograph is not named Captain and the backstory attached to the image is inaccurate. The expert's verdict provides a different account of the dog's story, indicating that the claim is based on false information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the dog's behavior by stating that he slept next to his owner's grave for 7 years. The expert's verdict suggests that the dog may have initially been found in the cemetery but did not consistently sleep there for such a long period.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an inaccurate backstory and attaching it to a different photograph. The expert's verdict highlights the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the claim's presentation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the dog's presence in the cemetery, suggesting that it may have been coincidental rather than a deliberate act of sleeping next to the owner's grave."}
