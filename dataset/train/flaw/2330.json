{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential limitations and restrictions on British businesses when it comes to buying and selling across Europe. The expert's verdict mentions that remaining in the EU would allow border checks and the UK couldn't opt out of free movement, which could imply some limitations on trade.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or support to substantiate the statement that British businesses have the right to buy and sell across Europe without tariffs or checks. The expert's verdict mentions other considerations and limitations related to remaining in the EU.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that remaining in the EU automatically grants British businesses the right to buy and sell across Europe without tariffs or checks. However, the expert's verdict highlights various factors that could impact this assumption, such as border checks and free movement restrictions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and considerations that contradict the claim, such as the potential limitations on free movement and the ability to set limits on EU migration. This suggests that there are alternative explanations to the claim's statement."}
