{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Scott Walker's views on abortion by stating that they are \"more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times.\" This is an extreme statement that may not accurately represent the full range of views held by Republican presidents.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Baldwin's office did not respond to requests for information to back her claim. This lack of supporting evidence suggests that there may be insufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Scott Walker's views on abortion will receive intensified scrutiny now that he has joined the Republican presidential field. While it is possible, this assumption is not explicitly supported by evidence and may be based on speculation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that some statements about Walker and abortion have missed the mark, including the TV ads by EMILY's List and NARAL Pro-Choice America. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations for Walker's views on abortion that have not been fully considered or addressed in the claim."}
