{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Obamacare on California seniors by stating that they will face benefit cuts of over $1,700 without providing enough evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that California seniors will face benefit cuts of over $1,700 as a result of Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all California seniors will face benefit cuts to the same degree, when in fact it only addresses Medicare Advantage, which is a private coverage option used by about one-third of seniors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the cuts to Medicare Advantage plans were intended to close the gap in cost between Advantage and traditional Medicare plans, and that Obamacare includes language protecting the set of guaranteed benefits from shrinking."}
