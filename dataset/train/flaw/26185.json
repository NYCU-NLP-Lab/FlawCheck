{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Texas GOP Chair Allen West claimed that the state has given out $19 billion in taxpayer subsidies to wind energy companies since 2006, but the source of this number was not provided. The expert also mentions that Carey King, a research scientist at the University of Texas, could not see how West came up with that figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim states that Texas has tripled its dependence on wind energy to 23-25 percent of its energy distribution system over the past 2-3 years. This assumption may be problematic as it does not provide any evidence or context for the claim. It is unclear how the dependence on wind energy was measured and whether other factors contributed to this increase.", "Understate": "The claim does not seem to understate any information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not seem to exaggerate any information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not seem to contradict any fact.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not seem to falter at times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the increase in wind energy dependence in Texas."}
