{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish that a vote to impeach U.S. President Andrew Johnson was held just three days after the offending action. The provided information does not offer any specific evidence or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the impeachment process for President Andrew Johnson was conducted in a similar manner to the current impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. However, the information provided does not directly compare the two situations or provide enough context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may have influenced the timing of the impeachment vote for President Andrew Johnson. It presents a simplistic view that the only reason it took three days was because the House took Sunday off, without considering other potential factors at play.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump is expected to last for months before an official vote on impeachment is held in the House. The comparison between the two situations presented in the claim is not accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and timeline of the impeachment process for President Andrew Johnson. The information provided only focuses on one specific aspect (the timing of the vote) without providing a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and its duration."}
