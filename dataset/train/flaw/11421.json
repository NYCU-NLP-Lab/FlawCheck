{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of Iraqi people who say it's okay to shoot an American soldier by not accurately reflecting the poll results.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not have enough support from the poll to directly state that 65 percent of Iraqi people find it acceptable to shoot an American soldier.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of people who find attacks on coalition forces acceptable is equivalent to the percentage who find shooting an American soldier acceptable, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the poll results, such as the exclusion of Kurdish responses, which could impact the percentage."}
