{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Obama sent $450 million to China to build a wind farm in Texas, which implies that the money was directly sent to China for this purpose.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on an ABC News report from 2010, which does not provide specific evidence or details about the alleged $450 million sent to China.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money sent to foreign companies for wind and solar projects under the stimulus program went overseas, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the use of stimulus funds for wind and solar projects, such as promoting domestic alternative energy industry and diversifying the country's energy supply."}
