{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of murders that occur with handguns, stating it as 97% when the actual figure is 46%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 97% of murders occur with handguns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the factual data provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which states that handguns were used in 46% of all homicides, not 97%.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights that Kinzinger's claim is not accurate and stretches the facts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that handguns are responsible for nearly all murders, which is not supported by the available data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that Kinzinger may have been referring to the share of firearm homicides that involve a handgun, which would be closer to the mark but still does not support the claim."}
