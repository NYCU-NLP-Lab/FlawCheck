{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family. This number is quite large and may be seen as an exaggeration to emphasize the point.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on research from the mid-1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley. While their research supports the existence of a word gap, the claim does not provide additional recent studies or evidence to support the specific number of 30 million words.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the word gap is solely caused by income disparity, without considering other factors that may contribute to differences in language exposure, such as cultural or educational differences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the word gap, such as differences in parenting styles, access to educational resources, or cultural differences in language use.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter if it is interpreted to mean that every child born into a low-income home hears exactly 30 million fewer words. It is possible that there is variation within low-income families, and not all children experience the exact same word gap.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the impact of the word gap by only focusing on the early years of a child's life. The expert's verdict mentions that the word gap can have long-term effects on academic achievement and life outcomes, but the claim does not explicitly highlight these broader implications."}
