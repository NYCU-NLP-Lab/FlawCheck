{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that the video shows an attack on voters by Akeredolu's security guards, leaving three people dead and his wife injured. The video actually shows an incident from a different context and time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the incident depicted in the video is recent and related to the state election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows an attack on voters by Akeredolu's security guards without verifying the authenticity or context of the footage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the actual context of the incident in Delta state during a PDP primary election."}
