{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of sorties that come back without dropping ordnances. The expert's verdict states that weapons were not used in 77 percent of sorties, which is higher than the claim of 75 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement about the concern for civilian casualties. It lacks enough support to validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the concern for civilian casualties is the primary reason for sorties coming back without dropping ordnances. However, the expert's verdict mentions other factors such as the intentional blending of ISIS forces with civilians and the desire to avoid alienating the local population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why sorties may come back without dropping ordnances. The expert's verdict mentions the Obama administration's efforts to avoid civilian casualties, but it also highlights the low ordnance expenditure rate compared to previous air campaigns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that weapons were used in 23 percent of the combat sorties, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim implies that no ordnances were dropped in 75 percent of sorties, which is not accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear timeframe for when the 75 percent figure was accurate. The expert's verdict mentions that the qualifier \"up until recently\" is valid, indicating that there has been a change in the weapons use rate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of concern for civilian casualties leading to sorties coming back without dropping ordnances. The expert's verdict suggests that while there is a concern, it may not be the sole or primary reason for the low weapons use rate."}
