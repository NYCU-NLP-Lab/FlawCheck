{"Exaggerate": "The claim in the TV ad exaggerates the impact of Joe Biden's election on fracking by suggesting that it will completely end the practice, while Biden's plan only prohibits new permits on federal land and waters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim in the TV ad lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that Biden's election will result in the end of fracking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim in the TV ad makes a problematic assumption that Biden's statements during the primaries reflect his actual policy intentions, even though he and his campaign have clarified his position on fracking.", "Contradict fact": "The claim in the TV ad contradicts the fact that Biden's written plan allows for the continuation of fracking under existing permits and in nonfederal areas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim in the TV ad ignores alternative explanations and interpretations of Biden's stance on fracking, focusing only on the narrative that he will ban or end the practice."}
