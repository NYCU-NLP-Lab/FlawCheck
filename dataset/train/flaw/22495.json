{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single study conducted in 2012, which surveyed a specific group of Hispanics in four cities. There is no evidence provided to support the claim that this study is representative of all Latinos or that it accurately reflects their likelihood of calling 911 when they are victims of a crime.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the hesitation of Latinos to call 911 is solely due to fear of deportation resulting from Trump's immigration policies. It does not consider other potential factors that could contribute to this hesitation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Latinos may be less likely to call 911 when they are victims of a crime. It only focuses on the fear of deportation as the primary reason, without exploring other possible cultural, social, or historical factors that could influence their behavior.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts a previous study conducted in 2008, which found that a majority of Hispanics would definitely contact the police if they were victims of a crime. This suggests that the claim's assertion that Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 may not be accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on a speech by a politician, which may contain biased or exaggerated statements. It is possible that the claim may not be entirely reliable or accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by attributing the hesitation of Latinos to call 911 solely to fear of deportation. It does not consider other potential factors, such as language barriers, distrust of law enforcement, or fear of retaliation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Trump's immigration policies on Latinos' likelihood to call 911. While it suggests a direct causal relationship between the two, it does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
