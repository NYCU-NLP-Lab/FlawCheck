{"Lack enough support": "The claim that James Biden \"built the cages\" and \"made millions from it\" lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support it. The press release and database search do not provide any information or contracts related to building cages at the border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that James Biden's hiring at HillStone International automatically connects him to the construction of cages at the U.S.-Mexico border, which is a problematic assumption without any factual basis.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no record of any U.S. government contract awarded to James Biden's company. The former CEO of HillStone International's parent company also confirms that James Biden's firm never received a U.S. government contract.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the lack of evidence or support for the connection between James Biden and the construction of cages at the border. The expert's verdict highlights the absence of any proof or documentation to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that the Obama administration did use chain-link fencing to hold immigrants at a border processing facility in McAllen, Texas. This suggests that the claim's attribution of the construction of cages solely to James Biden may not be accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing substantial evidence or proof to support its assertion. The lack of concrete information or contracts awarded to James Biden's company weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the involvement of James Biden and the amount of money made from the construction of cages. The expert's verdict indicates a lack of evidence to support these exaggerated claims."}
