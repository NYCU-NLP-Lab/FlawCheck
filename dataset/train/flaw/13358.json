{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole\" or that the photographs were taken in Montana or the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs are recent and depict a real event, but the expert's verdict reveals that the photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media since 2017. Therefore, the assumption that the photographs are recent and authentic is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photographs, suggesting that they were taken in China and depict a mother duck sheltering a puppy. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the photographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photographs were not taken recently and were not snapped in Montana or the United States, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the photographs by presenting them as evidence of a bird saving a frozen puppy. The expert's verdict suggests that the photographs may simply depict a mother duck sheltering a puppy, which may not be as extraordinary as the claim implies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its accuracy and reliability, as the expert's verdict reveals inconsistencies and lack of verification in the accompanying story and the source of the photographs."}
