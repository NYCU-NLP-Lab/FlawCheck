{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that all credit card skimmers run on Bluetooth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if a sequence of letters and numbers show up on a cell phone's Bluetooth search, it indicates the presence of a credit card skimmer. This assumption may not always be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The presence of a sequence of letters and numbers on a cell phone's Bluetooth search does not necessarily mean there is a credit card skimmer. It could be caused by other devices within proximity, such as devices in other cars.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of credit card skimming technology and the various methods used by criminals, including those that do not rely on Bluetooth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all credit card skimmers use Bluetooth technology. Some skimmers use cell service or store data internally.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its accuracy and reliability by suggesting that using a cell phone's Bluetooth search is a foolproof method to detect credit card skimmers."}
