{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of American families that rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level. The actual percentage is much lower than the claim suggests.", "Falters at times": "Shriver botched the wording of a different stat from the Shriver Report, which may indicate a lack of precision or accuracy in her statements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the assertion that two-thirds of American families rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mother's income is the sole factor keeping families above the poverty level, without considering other sources of income from fathers or other family members.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests alternative explanations for the reliance on the mother's income, such as families that were already poor or families that would not be poor even without the mother's income."}
