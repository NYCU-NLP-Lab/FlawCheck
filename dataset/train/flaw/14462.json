{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of UK students who have participated in the Erasmus exchange program. The expert's verdict mentions that the number is slightly lower than 15,000 in 2012, and it's unclear if the number has consistently been that high in other years.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of UK students who have participated in the Erasmus exchange program. The expert's verdict mentions that the number is actually 231,000 between 1987 and 2013, which is significantly higher than the claim's statement of \"more than 200,000.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the stated numbers. The expert's verdict mentions different figures from different sources, indicating a lack of consistent and reliable data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of UK students participating in the Erasmus exchange program is significant without providing any context or comparison to the total UK student population. The expert's verdict mentions that the participants represented roughly half a percent of the UK student population, suggesting that it may not be as significant as the claim implies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of UK students participating in the Erasmus exchange program. The expert's verdict mentions that almost twice as many European students came to the UK under the program, indicating that there may be other factors influencing the participation numbers."}
