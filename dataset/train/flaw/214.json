{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting details to confirm the involvement of raccoons in a fight during the reported burglary. It is based on a Facebook post from the Richmond Police Department, which may not provide substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the banging on the door reported by a city employee was related to a burglary. However, it is possible that the noise had a different cause unrelated to criminal activity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the reported banging on the door. It assumes that raccoons were involved in a fight, but there could be other possibilities, such as a different type of animal or a non-animal cause.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of presenting a clear and concise description of the reported incident. It includes additional information about raccoons breaking into another building in October 2020, which is not directly relevant to the initial claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the \"criminal-like behavior\" of raccoons by characterizing them as \"clever and cunning\" and associating their actions with burglaries. This could be an exaggeration of their natural behavior and instincts.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatements in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or information."}
