{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two-thirds during the existence of the Brady Bill ban. The claim is based on studies cited by Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn, but the specific studies or data are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the use of assault weapons in crimes is directly attributable to the Brady Bill ban. However, Flynn himself acknowledges that the researchers couldn't prove causation and that other strategies and tactics implemented by the police could have also contributed to the decrease.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the use of assault weapons in crimes during the Brady Bill ban. It solely attributes the decrease to the ban without exploring other potential factors that could have influenced the trend.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and specific citation for the studies mentioned by Flynn. This lack of clarity weakens the credibility of the claim and leaves room for doubt.", "Contradict fact": "There is a contradiction between the claim made by Flynn and the dispute raised by the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA disputes the claim of a two-thirds drop in the use of assault weapons in crimes, indicating that there is conflicting information and differing interpretations of the data.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Brady Bill ban on the use of assault weapons in crimes by stating a two-thirds decrease without sufficient evidence or causation proof. The claim seems to present a stronger correlation than what can be definitively supported."}
