{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gotabaya Rajapaksa supporters set fire to the Muslim-owned shop. The only evidence provided is the Facebook post and WhatsApp messages, which do not establish a direct link between the supporters and the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fire was a deliberate act by Gotabaya Rajapaksa supporters without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption. It is based on the assumption that the fire was politically motivated, which is not substantiated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The shop owner, Siddique Faiz, stated that the fire was most likely due to an electrical fault. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the fire was set by Gotabaya Rajapaksa supporters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement of the shop owner, who explicitly denies any suspicion or involvement of any individual or political group in connection to the fire. This contradicts the claim that Gotabaya Rajapaksa supporters were responsible for the incident.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the possibility of alternative explanations for the fire. It focuses solely on the claim of Gotabaya Rajapaksa supporters' involvement while downplaying the shop owner's statement about an electrical fault.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the incident or its impact. The claim accurately reports the occurrence of a fire at a Muslim-owned shop.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a misleading Facebook post and WhatsApp messages as the primary evidence. It does not provide additional reliable sources or investigations to support the claim."}
