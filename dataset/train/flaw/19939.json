{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Barbara Buono's record on taxes and debt by stating that she \"voted to raise taxes 154 times\" and \"drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt.\" While it is true that she voted in favor of various tax increases, the claim exaggerates the number of times she voted for such increases and oversimplifies her role in the state's debt.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of other legislators in supporting tax increases, as it implies that Buono was solely responsible for these decisions. The expert's verdict mentions that Buono was not the only legislator to support the tax increases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that Buono \"took New Jersey backwards.\" It does not provide specific examples or data to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all tax increases and the state's debt can be solely attributed to Buono's actions as a Trenton politician. However, the expert's verdict highlights the role of other legislators and the local level in determining property taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tax increases and debt, such as economic factors or the actions of other political figures. It solely blames Buono for these issues."}
