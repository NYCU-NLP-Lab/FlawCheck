{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Donald Trump said he would overturn the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision if elected president. The expert's verdict clarifies that Trump suggested strategic Supreme Court appointments could potentially overturn the ruling, but he did not specifically say he planned to personally overturn it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's statement implies a direct intention to overturn the Supreme Court's decision, while the expert's verdict highlights that he was discussing the possibility of appointing justices who might change things.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide direct quotes or evidence of Donald Trump explicitly stating his intention to overturn the marriage equality decision. The expert's verdict confirms that Trump did not make such a statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Donald Trump's statement, such as his belief that the issue should have been left to the states. The expert's verdict mentions Trump's view on states' rights as a factor in his discussion of the Supreme Court's decision."}
