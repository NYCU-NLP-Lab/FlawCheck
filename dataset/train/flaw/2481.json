{"Exaggerate": "The claim that George Floyd \"is not even dead\" exaggerates the situation by denying his death, despite the fact that two separate autopsies have confirmed his death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim that those involved in George Floyd's arrest were \"crisis actors\" lacks sufficient evidence and support. The expert mentions that the pictures that supposedly prove this theory actually show unrelated people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim relies on the problematic assumption that every national tragedy is followed by conspiracy theories aimed at undercutting calls for change. While conspiracy theories may arise in such situations, it is not a universal rule.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the term \"crisis actor\" originated from an acting studio offering safety exercises and active-shooter drills. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that crisis actors are involved in George Floyd's death.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that George Floyd's death has been confirmed through autopsies and widely reported by credible sources. The denial of his death goes against the established facts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single photo of a man resembling George Floyd at his own funeral as evidence. This single piece of evidence is not sufficient to support the claim that Floyd is alive.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
