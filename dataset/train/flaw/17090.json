{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the attribution of the quotation to Keanu Reeves. They mention checking a news archive that stretches back several decades and finding no evidence. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the attribution of the quotation to Keanu Reeves is a \"clear indication (though not definitive proof)\" that he did not come up with it. This assumption is problematic as it is not based on concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the meme featuring the quotation is a generic, unattributed quotation that was belatedly linked to Keanu Reeves online. This indicates the existence of an alternative explanation for the origin of the quote.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that Keanu Reeves once said or wrote the quoted statement. However, the expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that it is very unlikely that Reeves ever uttered or wrote those words.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration bias present in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias present in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not present any clear instances of faltering at times bias."}
