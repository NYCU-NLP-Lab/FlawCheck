{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Snapchat is using its \"Lenses\" technology to create a facial recognition database for law enforcement agencies. The expert's verdict mentions conspiracy theories and a class action lawsuit, but no concrete evidence is provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Snapchat's \"Lenses\" technology is being used to create a facial recognition database for law enforcement agencies, without providing any direct evidence or proof of such usage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions Snapchat's defense that their app relies on object recognition, not facial recognition, to make Lenses work. This suggests an alternative explanation to the claim, indicating that the app may not be creating a facial recognition database as alleged."}
