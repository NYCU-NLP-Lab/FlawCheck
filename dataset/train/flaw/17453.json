{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm the receipt of the award by the Indonesian Muslim leader. The only evidence provided is a video posted on Facebook and the caption of the post, which may not be enough to establish the veracity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Indonesian Muslim leader actually received the award from Malaysia based on the video and caption. However, the video is from 2018 and shows the leader receiving an award from Moeslim Choice magazine, not necessarily from Malaysia.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Indonesian Muslim leader was banned by the Indonesian government and arrested for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols. This raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the award by presenting it as a prestigious recognition from Malaysia. However, the evidence provided suggests that it was an annual event held by a Jakarta-based magazine.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays the significance of the award.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the video and caption are misleading or misinterpreted, and the Indonesian Muslim leader did not actually receive an award from Malaysia. The video is from 2018 and shows an award from Moeslim Choice magazine, not necessarily from Malaysia."}
