{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm that the church was built from the bones of Muslims who refused to convert to Christianity in Andalusia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the church in Portugal was built entirely from the bones of murdered Andalusian Muslims, without providing concrete evidence or historical context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of bones and skulls in the church, such as a traditional burial practice or a symbolic representation of earthly impermanence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the church, Capela dos Ossos, is located in Faro, Portugal, and not in Andalusia, Spain as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance or purpose of the Capela dos Ossos, reducing it to a mere tourist attraction rather than acknowledging its historical and cultural importance.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of skeletons collected in the church, stating that it holds around 5,000 skeletons of Muslim Moors who refused to convert, without providing evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability, as it is shared on social media platforms without proper verification or fact-checking."}
