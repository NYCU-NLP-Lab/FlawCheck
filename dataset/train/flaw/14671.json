{"Understate": "The claim understates the issue by suggesting that the universal background check was not fast enough, implying that it was the main problem in preventing the Charleston shooter from obtaining a gun. However, the expert's verdict explains that there were other significant factors, such as mistakes in the records and incorrect information, that contributed to the failure of the background check system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully justify its assertion that the universal background check was not fast enough in preventing the Charleston shooter from obtaining a gun. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information about the specific errors and issues in the background check process, which suggests that the claim may not have sufficient evidence to support its conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the universal background check system is solely responsible for preventing individuals like the Charleston shooter from obtaining guns. The expert's verdict points out that there were other factors, such as errors in the records and incorrect information, that contributed to the failure of the background check system. This assumption overlooks the complexity of the issue and oversimplifies the problem.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the failure of the background check system in preventing the Charleston shooter from obtaining a gun. The expert's verdict provides information about specific errors and mistakes in the process, highlighting that there were other contributing factors beyond the speed of the background check. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the failure of the system.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the background check system did catch the Charleston shooter's criminal history, but due to errors and incorrect information, the denial of the purchase was not possible. The expert's verdict explains the specific mistakes and issues in the background check process, which contradicts the claim's assertion that the universal background check was not fast enough.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of the universal background check system in preventing the Charleston shooter from obtaining a gun. It suggests that if the background check had been faster, the shooting could have been prevented. However, the expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation, highlighting that there were other significant factors, such as errors in the records and incorrect information, that contributed to the failure of the background check system."}
