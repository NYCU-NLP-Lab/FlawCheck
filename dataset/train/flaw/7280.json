{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"from the very first days of our state's history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote.\" While it is true that Vermont has allowed incarcerated people to vote since its founding, it is unclear if this has been the case since the very first days of the state's history.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it is unclear if Vermont has allowed incarcerated people to vote since the very first days of the state's history. The Sanders camp was unable to immediately reply to questions about the candidate's claim, suggesting a lack of clarity or inconsistency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the article mentions that the Sanders camp was unable to immediately reply to questions about the candidate's claim. This suggests that there may be a lack of concrete evidence or information to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all prisoners, regardless of the severity of their offense, should be allowed to vote. This assumption may be seen as problematic as it raises questions about whether individuals who have committed serious crimes should retain their right to participate in the democratic process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Vermont's Constitution allows incarcerated people to vote, but it is unclear if this has been the case since the state's founding. The claim may not fully consider alternative explanations or historical context."}
