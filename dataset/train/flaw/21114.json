{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the Social Security trust fund is already facing imminent bankruptcy. The expert's verdict explains that the trust fund has enough assets to continue paying benefits until 2036, and even after that, tax income would still be sufficient to cover three-quarters of scheduled benefits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion of imminent bankruptcy. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the annual reports of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which show that the trust fund balances will continue to grow until 2022 and that tax income will be sufficient to cover a significant portion of scheduled benefits until 2085.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current deficit and projections of future deficits automatically lead to imminent bankruptcy. However, the expert's verdict explains that the deficits are a result of economic factors and adjustments to correct excess payroll tax revenue credited to the trust funds in earlier years, and that the trust fund assets will continue to grow until 2022.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the financial situation of the Social Security trust fund. The expert's verdict provides information about the excess revenue from payroll taxes that went into the trust fund, which accumulated roughly $2.5 trillion, indicating that there are other factors at play besides imminent bankruptcy."}
