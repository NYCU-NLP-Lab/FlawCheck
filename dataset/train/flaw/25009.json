{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential revenue that the sports betting bill would create for the state. The estimated range of $12.5 million to $30.9 million may be higher than what is realistic, as it is based on assumptions and data from other states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the estimated revenue range. The committee used data from Mississippi to estimate the potential revenue for Missouri, but it did not address the $30.9 million estimation provided by State Sen. Denny Hoskins.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Missouri's sports betting revenue would be 2 percent of its gaming revenue, based on data from Mississippi. This assumption may not be accurate as each state's gambling market and regulations can vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the estimated revenue range. The claim does not consider factors such as the level of interest in sports betting among Missourians, the effectiveness of the bill's implementation, and potential competition from neighboring states.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of how the estimated revenue range was determined. The committee's estimation process and the specific factors considered are not fully explained.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim is understating the potential revenue that the sports betting bill would create for the state.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any established facts. However, it is important to note that the claim is based on assumptions and estimations rather than concrete evidence."}
