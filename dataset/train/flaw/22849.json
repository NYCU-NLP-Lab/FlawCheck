{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of seniors who died from the COVID vaccine by suggesting that it is happening \"around the world\" and implying a widespread issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that seniors who died after receiving the COVID vaccine were improperly listed as \"natural causes.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deaths of seniors who received the COVID vaccine were directly caused by the vaccine without providing any substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence linking the deaths of seniors, such as Hank Aaron, in Gibraltar, and Norway to the COVID vaccine.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of COVID-19 in the deaths of seniors by suggesting that their cause of death was listed as \"natural causes\" without acknowledging the potential impact of the virus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the deaths of seniors, such as underlying health conditions or other factors unrelated to the COVID vaccine.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a source, Dr. Joseph Mercola, who has faced criticism from federal agencies and the medical community for his anti-vaccine efforts."}
