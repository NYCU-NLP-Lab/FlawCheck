{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to validate the statement that there are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined. The source provided by the Cicilline campaign does not offer any numbers or a credible source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of oil rigs in Russia and onshore China is not significant enough to impact the comparison. However, the Baker Hughes data does not include these statistics, and there are indications that both Russia and China have a significant number of active rigs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative explanations or factors that could influence the comparison of oil rigs in the United States and the rest of the world. The information provided suggests that there are difficulties in obtaining accurate data for certain countries, which could impact the overall comparison."}
