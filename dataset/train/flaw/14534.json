{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the song in the video is a Chinese-language version of an Indonesian patriotic song, rather than a completely new anthem in Mandarin.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Indonesia's new anthem is in Mandarin, as the evidence provided clearly states that it is a Chinese-language version of an existing Indonesian song.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Chinese-language version of the song is a new national anthem for Indonesia, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the Chinese-language version of the song was produced to introduce Indonesia to other countries, as the Indonesian version would not be understood internationally."}
