{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Jared Golden's support for using Social Security to fund other government programs. Golden's support is based on a separate referendum that aims to fund a home care program, not directly linked to Social Security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct connection between Golden's support for the home care program and using Social Security to fund other government programs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Golden's support for the home care program automatically translates into support for using Social Security, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Golden's support for the home care program, which is to address the issue of funding for a specific healthcare initiative rather than using Social Security."}
