{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of police punishment towards laborers during the lockdown. The photograph shows policemen making people squat and hold their ears, but it does not provide evidence of any severe physical punishment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the laborers were punished solely for leaving during the lockdown. The photograph alone does not provide context or details about the specific reasons for their punishment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals in the photograph are laborers who were punished for leaving during the lockdown. However, there are hints in the photograph that suggest they may not be migrant workers, such as the presence of motorcycles in the background and the lack of luggage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests an alternative explanation for the punishment depicted in the photograph. According to PTI photographer Rahul Shukla, the individuals had violated lockdown protocol by stepping out without a valid reason and failing to provide ID proof. This suggests that their punishment may have been related to their violation of the lockdown guidelines, rather than solely for leaving during the lockdown.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph was shared by journalist Rana Ayyub and historian William Dalrymple as evidence of laborers being punished for leaving during the lockdown. However, both Ayyub and Dalrymple later took down their tweets, indicating that they may have realized the misinterpretation or lack of evidence in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation and the reasons behind the police punishment. It does not consider the possibility that the individuals may have violated lockdown guidelines or failed to provide valid reasons for being outside during the lockdown.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the context and details surrounding the photograph. It relies on the assumption that the laborers were punished solely for leaving during the lockdown without considering alternative explanations or additional information provided by the PTI photographer."}
