{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Fritz Kaegi's involvement in managing the fund that invested in private prisons. It implies that he personally managed the fund, but it is stated that he was one of three managers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation that Fritz Kaegi \"only saw profits\" from the private prison investments. It does not provide any information on Kaegi's views or actions regarding the investments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that investing in private prisons automatically implies support for or profiting from abusive practices within the prisons. This assumption is not substantiated and may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the investment in private prisons, such as it being a part of a diversified portfolio managed by Kaegi and not necessarily reflecting his personal views or endorsement of the private prison industry.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear timeline of Kaegi's involvement in managing the fund and when the investments in private prisons were made. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion and potential misinterpretation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kaegi left the fund management on March 13, before the investments in private prisons were added to the portfolio between March 14 and March 31."}
