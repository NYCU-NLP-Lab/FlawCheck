{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or statistics to support the statement that suicide is the second-leading cause of death among 15-19 year olds and 25-34 year olds in Missouri. Although the expert mentions the fact sheets from Everytown for Gun Safety and the Missouri Institute of Mental Health, the claim itself does not provide direct evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that carrying firearms on college campuses would provide \"more chances for people to commit suicide.\" This assumption may not be universally accepted and could be debated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high suicide rates among 15-19 year olds and 25-34 year olds in Missouri. It does not explore other factors or causes that could contribute to these statistics.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of presenting a clear and concise argument. The expert's verdict includes various unrelated information about a bill and a state representative's concerns, which may distract from the main focus of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim. The claim presents suicide as the second-leading cause of death among the mentioned age groups without minimizing its significance.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim. The claim presents suicide as a significant cause of death but does not overstate its prevalence.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting facts in the claim. The claim presents suicide as the second-leading cause of death among specific age groups in Missouri, which aligns with the information provided by the fact sheets mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
