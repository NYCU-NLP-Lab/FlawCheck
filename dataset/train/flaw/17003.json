{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that students have to repeat the same grade next year, which is not supported by evidence or official directives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no blanket directives on a state or federal level requiring kids to repeat their current grade.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that students will have to repeat their current grade next year due to school closures, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations, such as parents and educators working together to decide if a student should repeat a grade, but there are no blanket directives requiring it."}
