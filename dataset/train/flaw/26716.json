{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of consensus among the scientific community, as it states that \"over 97 percent\" believe that humans are contributing to climate change.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific studies or sources to back up the claim of 97 percent consensus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 97 percent figure represents the entire scientific community, while there may be alternative interpretations or variations in opinion within the broader scientific community.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or dissenting views from climate change skeptics who argue that the 97 percent figure is not credible.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide a clear definition of what is meant by \"contributing to climate change\" and whether it implies a significant or minor contribution.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all scientific studies or abstracts express an opinion on whether man-made global warming is occurring. Only a portion of the studies examined in the research endorsed the consensus position.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the level of consensus among actively publishing climate scientists, as the research cited shows that 97.1 percent of the studies that expressed an opinion endorsed the consensus position."}
