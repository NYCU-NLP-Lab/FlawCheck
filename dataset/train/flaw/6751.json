{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that federal law will mandate getting rid of existing light bulbs, when in fact the law only sets standards for new light bulbs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details to back up the assertion that existing light bulbs will be mandated to be replaced.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires individuals to get rid of their existing light bulbs, which is not accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 does not require individuals to dispose of their existing light bulbs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the new standards for light bulbs are intended to gradually replace older, less efficient bulbs over time without mandating immediate disposal of existing bulbs."}
