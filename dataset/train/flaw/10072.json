{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the involvement of Planned Parenthood in spending $30 million in taxpayer subsidies to influence the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections. Planned Parenthood Votes is just one member of a coalition of organizations planning to expend $30 million to mobilize \"infrequent voters\" in the elections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific details about the alleged $30 million expenditure by Planned Parenthood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taxpayer subsidies received by Planned Parenthood should not be used for political activities, without considering the legal framework and regulations governing the organization's political arm.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the $30 million initiative is a collaborative effort by multiple organizations, including Planned Parenthood Votes, to mobilize voters for progressive candidates, rather than solely for the benefit of Planned Parenthood itself."}
