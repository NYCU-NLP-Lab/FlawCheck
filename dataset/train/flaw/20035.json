{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a third-hand report from the Wall Street Journal.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the actual amount of leases signed, as it is based on a single company's reported spending of $1 billion on leases without drilling.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported spending by one company represents the total amount of leases signed across Ohio, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the reported spending, such as strategic investments or long-term planning by the company, rather than indicating a widespread trend among homeowners."}
