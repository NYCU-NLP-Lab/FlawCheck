{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Gov. Pat McCrory \"tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years.\" This is not accurate as McCrory's 2016 proposal suggested the largest budget share for education since the recession.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that McCrory tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that McCrory's proposed budget share for education is directly linked to the number of teachers having to move to other states due to low pay. There may be other factors contributing to teachers' decisions to relocate.", "Alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists as McCrory's proposals for education funding were not adopted by the legislature, so it is not accurate to claim that he \"tried to cut\" education's budget share."}
