{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the increase in the number of infants in large classes by stating that it has increased by 18% over the last three years. The expert's verdict provides information about the increase in the number of children in large classes but does not specifically mention the 18% figure.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the problem by only mentioning the increase in the number of infants in large classes in Wales. The expert's verdict provides information about overcrowded classrooms and children in classes of more than 30 in both Wales and England, indicating a larger issue beyond just infants in Wales.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement about the increase in the number of infants in large classes. The expert's verdict provides some supporting evidence, such as the number of children in classes of 36 or more in England in 2016, but it does not directly address the increase in infants in Wales.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the increase in the number of infants in large classes. The expert's verdict mentions factors such as greater pressures on school places and fluctuations in class sizes in primary and secondary schools, suggesting that there could be multiple factors contributing to the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in the number of infants in large classes is a negative outcome without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions overcrowded classrooms and the negative impact on children, but it does not explicitly state that the increase in infants in large classes is problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any specific facts. The expert's verdict provides additional information and context but does not contradict the claim itself.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information or context. The expert's verdict provides additional information and data, but it does not point out any specific inconsistencies or weaknesses in the claim."}
