{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of members expelled from the House and Senate. The expert's verdict states that a total of 14 members were expelled, while the claim states that only 3 House members and 11 Senators were expelled.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for the expulsion was solely based on not acknowledging Abraham Lincoln's election as president. The expert's verdict clarifies that the motions to expel the members did not cite their attitude towards Lincoln's election as a reason for expulsion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict points out that the men who were expelled were attempting to secede from the Union, making their attitude towards Lincoln's election of little relevance. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for their expulsion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that none of the motions to expel the members mentioned their attitude towards Lincoln's election.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing accurate information about the number of members expelled.", "Understate": "The claim understates the total number of members expelled, as it only mentions a subset of the expelled members."}
