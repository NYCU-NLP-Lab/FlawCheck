{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Nicole Kidman's alleged blacklisting from Hollywood for supporting President Trump. The article states that she had contracts cancelled by two Hollywood studios and was warned by \"famous liberal celebrities\" to steer clear of the Oscars, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support these claims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Nicole Kidman was actually blacklisted from Hollywood for supporting President Trump. The article relies on unnamed sources and does not provide any concrete examples or testimonies from industry insiders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nicole Kidman's alleged blacklisting from Hollywood is solely due to her support for President Trump. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for her perceived decline in popularity or opportunities in the industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Nicole Kidman's perceived decline in opportunities or support in Hollywood, such as changes in the industry, personal choices, or other professional factors. The claim does not explore or acknowledge these possibilities."}
