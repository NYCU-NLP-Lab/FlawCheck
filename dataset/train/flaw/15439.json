{"Exaggerate": "The claim that protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Wisconsin State House is likely an exaggeration, as the expert's verdict states that the evidence for this claim was a single page, handwritten estimate that was almost immediately retracted. The actual assessment of the damages resulted in $270,000 in wear and tear to the building.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided for the $7.5 million damage is a single page, handwritten estimate that was retracted.
