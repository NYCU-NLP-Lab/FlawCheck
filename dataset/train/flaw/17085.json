{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the need for two new prisons by stating that there will be a shortage of 2,000 prison beds by 2021. This may be an overestimation of the actual need.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that two new prisons will be needed. It relies on a presentation from the Council of State Governments' Justice Center, but more comprehensive data or analysis would be required to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current trajectory will continue and lead to a shortage of prison beds. However, this assumption may not take into account potential changes in policies, inmate populations, or other factors that could impact the need for new prisons.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the need for new prisons, such as potential improvements in rehabilitation programs, changes in sentencing policies, or alternative approaches to addressing the prison population challenge."}
