{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people exposed to the virus by stating that over 1 million people in North Carolina have been exposed, considering the lower number of lab-reported cases in the state.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on preliminary data from an antibody study at Wake Forest University, which may not be conclusive or definitive.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on an antibody study that may not be definitive and does not provide enough evidence to support the claim of 1 million people being exposed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the antibody testing conducted by Dr. John Sanders at Wake Forest University is a reliable and accurate measure of exposure to the virus, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of antibodies, such as exposure to other coronavirus strains or the possibility of false positive results."}
