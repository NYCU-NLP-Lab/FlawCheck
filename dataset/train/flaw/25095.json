{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in young voter turnout in early voting by stating that it was up 500%. The actual increase was closer to 200% when including Election Day votes.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in overall youth turnout in Texas by only focusing on early voting. The Tufts University study found that the rate of overall youth turnout roughly tripled over 2014.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim mentions research by TargetSmart, it does not provide any specific data or evidence to support the statement about winning more votes than any Democrat in the history of Texas. It would need more supporting evidence to be considered well-supported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in young voter turnout was solely due to Beto O'Rourke's efforts, without considering other factors or campaigns that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in young voter turnout, such as broader political trends or issues that may have motivated young voters to participate in the election."}
