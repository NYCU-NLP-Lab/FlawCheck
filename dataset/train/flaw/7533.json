{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that using marijuana as a teenager regularly will result in an exact loss of eight IQ points, which may not be the case for every individual.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single study and there is ongoing debate and conflicting research on the topic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between marijuana use as a teenager and a specific loss of IQ points, without considering other potential factors that may contribute to IQ changes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by the economist Ole Rogeberg, who argues that socioeconomic status may play a role in the observed IQ changes, rather than solely marijuana use.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no scientific consensus on the issue and that there are conflicting studies and opinions on the relationship between marijuana use and IQ.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not acknowledging the limitations and criticisms of the study it is based on, such as the small sample size and potential confounding factors like socioeconomic status."}
