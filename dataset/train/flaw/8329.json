{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that Indira Gandhi gave a speech to the Indian army at Galwan Valley in 1971.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of Indira Gandhi addressing army men in Leh in 1971 is the same as her addressing soldiers in Galwan Valley, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The image is attributed to DPR Defence and the description states that it shows Indira Gandhi addressing jawans in Leh in 1971. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the speech was given in Galwan Valley.", "Contradict fact": "The location of the speech is contradicted by the fact that Galwan Valley is at least 219 kilometers away from Leh, as per Google Maps.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the location of the speech and making assumptions without sufficient evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the image by linking it to recent clashes between India and China in Galwan Valley.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
