{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Dewhurst's fiscal record by stating that he has \"never once cut one penny from the state budget\" without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Dewhurst has never cut any money from the state budget.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that Dewhurst may not have budget-cutting duties and that the lieutenant governor has no specified role in writing each state budget, which presents an alternative explanation for the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the complexity of budgetary decisions and the factors that influence them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting a penny from the state budget is the sole measure of fiscal responsibility, without considering other aspects of budget management.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Dewhurst has presided over the adoption of five two-year state budgets, some of which were balanced partly by enacting cuts in the face of revenue shortfalls.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accounting for the latest state budget, which shows less spending in 2012-13 than the previous biennium, and by not considering other ways to gauge whether Dewhurst has ever cut a penny from the budget."}
