It fails to mention that it does not apply to people outside of Oklahoma or those without valid licenses.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough context and information about the specific law in Oklahoma that led to the removal of THC from drug-test screenings. It leaves out important details that could clarify the limited scope of the change.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate its assertion that THC will be removed from drug-test screenings starting on August 30th. It does not provide any evidence or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the audience is aware of the specific medical marijuana law in Oklahoma and its implications. It does not clarify that the change only applies to a specific subset of people.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the removal of THC from drug-test screenings. It presents the information as a definitive fact without exploring other potential reasons for the change."}
