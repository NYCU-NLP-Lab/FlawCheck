{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of wearing masks on oxygen intake by stating that people are \"not getting enough oxygen\" while wearing masks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence to support the assertion that people are not getting enough oxygen while wearing masks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of an air-quality monitor can accurately measure oxygen intake while wearing a mask, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that overall air quality is not generally adversely affected when healthy people wear most types of masks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that cotton masks and surgical masks do not limit oxygen intake, as stated by scientists.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, as it focuses solely on the potential impact on oxygen intake.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its use of an air-quality monitor to measure oxygen concentration, as the expert explains that these monitors are not ideal for this purpose."}
