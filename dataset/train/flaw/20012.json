{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence to support the accusation that Zee News played morphed footage of Bharat bandh protests. The expert's verdict mentions that a collage of two photographs is viral on social media, but it does not provide concrete proof of manipulation by Zee News.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Zee News intentionally played morphed footage to show a visibly Muslim looking man holding a gun. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the longer beard seen in the Zee News footage may be due to freeze frames or special effects used by the channel. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the footage was intentionally manipulated.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the potential impact of the viral images and the accusations against Zee News. While it acknowledges the circulation of the images on social media, it does not address the potential consequences or implications of such manipulation if it were proven true.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict may falter at times in providing a clear analysis or conclusion. While it presents information about the different channels and their use of the footage, it does not definitively determine whether the Zee News footage was morphed or manipulated.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of facts in the claim or the expert's verdict. Both acknowledge the existence of the viral images and the use of the footage by different channels, but the verdict does not provide conclusive evidence to support or contradict the claim of morphed footage."}
