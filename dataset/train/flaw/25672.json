{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of drug overdose deaths by stating that \"about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day.\" The actual number provided by the CDC is slightly lower at just shy of 120 per day.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the full number of drug overdose deaths by only including deaths from prescription and illicit drugs. The CDC does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so the accounting may not capture the full extent of drug overdose deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific sources or data to back up the claim. It only mentions the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the source of the information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms based on the provided information. However, it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the difference in death rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in death rates between drug overdoses and deaths from firearms. It does not explore other factors such as access to firearms, gun control policies, or the demographics of drug overdose victims compared to firearm-related deaths."}
