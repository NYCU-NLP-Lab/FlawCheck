{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that FEMA is offering hazard pay for work during the coronavirus pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that FEMA has authorized one-time hazard pay compensation payments up to $4800.00 per person during the pandemic, without providing any concrete evidence or official statements from FEMA to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the official FEMA coronavirus webpage does not mention any direct relief payments to individuals. The webpage instead focuses on assistance for purchasing flood insurance and temporary housing units.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the availability and amount of hazard pay compensation offered by FEMA during the pandemic, as there is no official confirmation or evidence provided to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by providing a link that leads to an offensive image of a gorilla, instead of directing users to an official FEMA site or relevant information about hazard pay.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a hoax or misinformation, as FEMA's official \"Coronavirus Rumor Control\" webpage warns about scammers using COVID-19 to take advantage of people and advises against trusting anyone who promises immediate monetary assistance."}
