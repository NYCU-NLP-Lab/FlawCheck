{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Social Security was advocated as a way of getting people to quit working due to a perceived scarcity of jobs. This assumption is not supported by evidence from historians.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Social Security was advocated for the purpose of getting people to quit working.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Historians point to the Townsend Plan as a different pension proposal that aimed to free up jobs and stimulate the economy, which may have influenced the development of Social Security.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of historians who have studied the Social Security legislation and found little evidence to support the idea that it was intended to encourage people to quit working.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the historical context and the various factors that contributed to the development of Social Security.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a response or explanation from George Will's office, which could have offered further insight or clarification.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
