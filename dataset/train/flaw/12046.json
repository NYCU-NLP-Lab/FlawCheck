{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it attributes a quote to Thomas Jefferson that cannot be directly linked to him. The expert's verdict states that the phrase \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms\" originated with Jefferson but the sentence \"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government\" appears to be a modern augmentation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Thomas Jefferson wrote the quoted statement about the right to bear arms. However, the expert's verdict points out that there is no evidence to support this assumption and that the sentence does not appear in Jefferson's recorded writings, letters, or speeches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim by stating that the quote attributed to Jefferson is a modern augmentation and does not date back much further than its publication in a 1989 pro-Second Amendment newspaper column by Charlie Reese. This suggests that the claim may have originated from Reese rather than Jefferson."}
