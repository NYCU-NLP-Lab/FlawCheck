{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden is \"following through with a fracking ban\" when in reality, he has only banned new fracking on federal land.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Biden is implementing a fracking ban.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Biden's actions on federal land equate to a complete fracking ban, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the expert's verdict clarifies that Biden's actions only pertain to new fracking on federal land, leaving current fracking operations untouched."}
