{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the mugshots showing arrestees wearing Nike shirts. It is mentioned that \"at least 11 of the 182 inmates were shown wearing a large, black T-shirt with NIKE ATHLETICS,\" but it is unclear if this represents a significant number or if it is a common occurrence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the mugshots were intended as a jab at Nike. The expert's verdict mentions that the sheriff denied any intention of mocking Nike, and there is no direct statement or evidence from the sheriff supporting the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why the arrestees were wearing Nike shirts in their mugshots. It is possible that the shirts were provided by the sheriff's department for identification purposes or that the arrestees were wearing their own clothing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the sheriff denying any intention of mocking Nike. The expert's verdict mentions that the sheriff denied the claim, suggesting that the claim may not be accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the mugshots as a deliberate jab at Nike. While the claim implies that numerous arrestees were dressed in Nike shirts, the expert's verdict mentions that \"at least 11\" out of 182 inmates were shown wearing Nike shirts. This suggests that the number may not be as significant as implied.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent narrative. The expert's verdict mentions conflicting information, such as the removal of mugshots from the sheriff's website and the inability to reach the sheriff or the public relations officer for comment. This lack of consistency raises doubts about the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of dressing the arrestees in Nike shirts was to mock the company and Colin Kaepernick. However, this assumption is not supported by direct evidence or statements from the sheriff or the department."}
