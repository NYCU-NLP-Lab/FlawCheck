{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide concrete evidence or sources to verify the authenticity of the photograph or the occurrence of the \"Angel Flight\" releasing a flare salute.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph shows an \"Angel Flight\" releasing a flare salute in honor of fallen soldiers it is transporting, without providing substantial evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the aircraft in the photograph does not appear to be a United States Air Force C-130 plane, but rather a Russian Ilyushin Il-76. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the photograph shows an \"Angel Flight.\"", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and potential misinterpretation of the term \"angel flight,\" as it mentions that the term is sometimes used to refer to an aircraft transporting fallen soldiers, but does not provide further explanation or clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the flares shown in the photograph are deployed primarily as a defense mechanism, rather than to honor fallen soldiers. This presents an alternative explanation to the claim's assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it misidentifies the aircraft in the photograph and makes assumptions without sufficient evidence or confirmation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
