{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows a fire at a Saudi Airlines office in Bangladesh, not a burnt down mosque in Wamena, Indonesia.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the intact Quran inside the burnt down mosque, presenting it as a miraculous event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video clip and a caption without any additional evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the intact Quran is evidence of divine intervention or protection, without considering other possible explanations for why it remained intact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video actually shows a fire at a Saudi Airlines office in Bangladesh, which has been previously reported and documented."}
