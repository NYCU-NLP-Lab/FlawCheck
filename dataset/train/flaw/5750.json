{"Lack enough support": "The claim of a protester cutting off a police officer's finger with pliers lacks sufficient evidence or support. The claim is not backed by any reliable sources or official reports.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the police did not mention pliers being used as a weapon in their report. This indicates that the claim is false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photos in the claim are actually keyframes from a video that show the protester holding a baton after grabbing it from a police officer. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim of a finger being cut off with pliers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the incident by suggesting that a protester cut off a police officer's finger. The actual incident, as reported by the police commissioner, involved a police officer having part of his finger bitten off.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos provided are evidence of a protester cutting off a police officer's finger with pliers, without considering alternative explanations or verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the provided claim."}
