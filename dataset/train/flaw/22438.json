{"Understate": "The claim may understate the generational gap in voting patterns by simply stating that older voters voted to leave, without providing specific percentages or data on the extent of the generational divide.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the assertion that \"under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay.\" Without more concrete evidence, the claim may lack sufficient support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim attributes the generational gap to age, it does not explore other potential factors that could have influenced the voting patterns, such as socioeconomic status, education level, or regional differences. Therefore, alternative explanations for the generational divide are not fully explored."}
