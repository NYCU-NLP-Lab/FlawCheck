{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the fare increase by stating that fares rose anywhere from 25 percent to 47 percent, when in fact the increase was 10 percent for most services and 25 percent for rail fares and interstate/commuter buses.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fare increase occurred in May 2010, not in the current year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for the stated fare increase percentages.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any fare increase is equivalent to a tax increase, which may be a problematic assumption as fare increases can be implemented for various reasons unrelated to taxation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately stating the timing and extent of the fare increase, as acknowledged by the person making the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fare increase, such as the anticipated budget gap faced by NJ Transit officials."}
