{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of new carbon regulations by stating that it will increase electric bills by \"$17 billion every year\" and \"potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the specific figures mentioned regarding the increase in electric bills and job losses. It is not clear how these numbers were calculated or what analysis was used to arrive at them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration's goal of reducing carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030 is equivalent to a 42 percent reduction, which is a significant difference. This assumption may skew the potential impact of the regulations and the associated costs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to changes in electric bills or job losses. It solely attributes these outcomes to the new carbon regulations without considering other variables that could be at play.", "Falters at times": "The claim is not consistently supported by the evidence provided. The expert's verdict highlights that the figures mentioned in the claim come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study, which may have its own limitations or biases. The claim does not address these potential shortcomings in the study's methodology or assumptions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama administration's goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent, not 42 percent as assumed in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce study. This discrepancy undermines the accuracy and validity of the claim's figures."}
