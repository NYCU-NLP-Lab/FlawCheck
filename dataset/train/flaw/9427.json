{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Bryce Reeves is linked to a company that sent jobs to China. The expert's investigation found no direct evidence that the Waynesboro jobs specifically went to China.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Bryce Reeves directly played a role in sending jobs to China.
