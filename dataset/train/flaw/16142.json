{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the START II Treaty by stating that it has substantially reduced the nuclear stockpiles of both Russia and the United States, when in reality Russia has not reduced its stockpiles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the treaty has substantially reduced nuclear stockpiles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the START II Treaty requires both countries to reduce their nuclear stockpiles, which is not the case. The treaty actually limits the number of warheads that can be deployed on strategic launchers and bombers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Russia has actually increased its deployed warheads since the treaty took effect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that the decrease in the U.S.'s deployed strategic nuclear warheads could be attributed to factors other than the START II Treaty, such as strategic decisions or changes in military priorities."}
