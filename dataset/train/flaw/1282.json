{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there will still be tens of millions of people not covered. This assumption may be problematic because it does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any data or evidence to support the assertion that there will still be tens of millions of people not covered after Obamacare is fully implemented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections show a decrease in the number of non-elderly people without insurance over time. The CBO projections indicate that the number of uninsured individuals will decrease, not remain in the tens of millions.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it uses strong language such as \"tens of millions\" without providing specific numbers or evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Obamacare in reducing the number of uninsured individuals. The CBO projections show a significant decrease in the number of uninsured individuals, which is not reflected in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the number of uninsured individuals, such as changes in employment status, eligibility criteria, or individual choices."}
