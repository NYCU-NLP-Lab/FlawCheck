{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton had a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes. The only source of information seems to be an account from two women who claim to have seen Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes, but their credibility is questionable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a private meeting between Clinton and Snipes would be unusual and implies that it could be evidence of crooked campaign tactics. However, it is not uncommon for election supervisors to meet with party officials, and there is no evidence to support the claim of any wrongdoing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that the two women who reported the meeting may have misunderstood or misinterpreted the situation. They admit to being in a secured area of a presidential candidate visit and were shooed off by security.", "Contradict fact": "Both Brenda Snipes and a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida have denied that such a meeting took place. Snipes called it a \"big fat lie,\" contradicting the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the skepticism surrounding the allegation. The fact-checkers initially expressed skepticism about the claim, highlighting Snipes' lack of political involvement and the endorsements she received from politicians who opposed Clinton.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the alleged meeting by suggesting that it is evidence of a voter fraud scheme. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it seems to be speculative rather than based on facts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on the account of two individuals who claim to have seen the meeting but provide no concrete evidence or corroboration. This raises doubts about the reliability of the claim."}
