{"Understate": "The claim may understate the issue by stating that a girl is \"more likely\" to be married by 18 than to know how to read, without providing specific statistics or a comparison to the literacy rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on outdated data from 2007, rather than more recent data from 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the marriage rate and literacy rate are directly comparable and mutually exclusive, without considering other factors that may contribute to the statistics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the statistics, such as cultural or socioeconomic factors, that are not addressed in the claim."}
