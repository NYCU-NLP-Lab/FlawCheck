{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that 95% of stop and frisks were cut out, which may not accurately represent the full extent of the reduction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 95% of stop and frisks were cut out.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in stop and frisks during Bloomberg's tenure was solely due to his discovery and intervention, without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reduction in stop and frisks, such as public outcry and impending lawsuits challenging the police department's tactics.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that stop and frisks actually increased significantly during Bloomberg's first 10 years in office, before declining in his later years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive overview of the stop and frisk policy under Bloomberg's tenure, only focusing on a specific period of time.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the increase in stop and frisks during Bloomberg's earlier years as mayor, which rose by over 600% according to data from the New York Civil Liberties Union."}
