{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Rwanda has completely dropped French as an official language, when in fact it still remains one of the official languages.", "Understate": "The claim understates the presence and importance of French in Rwanda by implying that it has been completely removed as an official language, when in reality it is still recognized as one.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no reliable news media reports confirming that Rwanda has dropped French as an official language.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the addition of Swahili as an official language means the removal of French, without considering that multiple languages can coexist as official languages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the adoption of English as an official language was not intended to replace French, but rather to align with English-speaking countries and the East African Community."}
