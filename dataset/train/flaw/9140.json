{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify its accuracy. The only evidence provided is a Facebook post and an image, which are both questionable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the women in the image are sex workers who support William Ruto based on the banner they are holding. However, there is no concrete evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Kenya Sex Workers Alliance (Keswa) released a statement denying any involvement in the claim. The organization clarified that the images were fake and not from them or any of their member organizations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for William Ruto by stating that \"thousands\" of sex workers have vowed to support him. This claim is based on the questionable Facebook post and lacks substantial evidence.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may understate the significance of the image by not acknowledging that it has been used in previous protests by sex workers, highlighting their plight and calling for their rights.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the image, as it has been used in previous protests by sex workers to raise awareness about their issues and not necessarily to express support for a political candidate."}
