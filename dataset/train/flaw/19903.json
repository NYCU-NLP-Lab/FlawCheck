{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they emailed Webb multiple times asking for the sources of his numbers but did not receive a response. Therefore, there is a lack of supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having 25 percent of the world's known prison population is too high without providing any context or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the year from which the study tallies prison populations differs from country to country, which could potentially affect the accuracy and comparison of the statistics.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the issue by only focusing on the percentage of the world's known prison population without considering other factors such as crime rates, justice system differences, or cultural factors that may contribute to the higher prison population in the United States.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Chinese government's numbers may not be complete, and there may be additional prisoners serving in pre-trial or administrative detention. This suggests that the claim may not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of the world's prison population.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates any information."}
