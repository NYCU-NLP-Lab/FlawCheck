{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that \"Deep State\" Democrats coordinated the attack on two oil tankers and a U.S. drone and celebrated because they \"dragged Trump into war.\" There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or factual support to substantiate the allegations made about Democratic leaders coordinating the attacks and celebrating.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Trump administration has placed the blame for the attacks on Iran, not on Democratic leaders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes the existence of a \"Deep State\" and implicates Democratic leaders without providing any substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the attacks were carried out by Iran, as stated by the Trump administration."}
