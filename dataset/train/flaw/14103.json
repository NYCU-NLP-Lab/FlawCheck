{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the Wisconsin school voucher program has no research showing it will improve student learning lacks enough support. The expert's verdict mentions that there are limited ways to compare the performance of voucher vs public school students, and there are conflicting studies and reports on the topic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of research directly proving the improvement of student learning means that the voucher program is ineffective. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are different approaches and measures used to evaluate the performance of voucher students, and the results can vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of research showing improvement in student learning. The expert's verdict mentions that Wisconsin does not require voucher schools to disclose certain measures, such as retention rates or graduation rates, which could be factors influencing the perception of improvement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been studies and reports comparing the performance of voucher and public school students in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict mentions studies that show different results, such as the Milwaukee Public Schools outperforming voucher students in reading and math tests.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the voucher program on student learning. While the expert's verdict presents conflicting evidence and limitations in research, it does not definitively state that the program has no impact on student learning."}
