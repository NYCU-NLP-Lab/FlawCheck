{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of flu deaths by stating that 80,000 people died from the flu in the U.S. last year, while the actual estimate is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the stated number of flu deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC's estimate for seasonal flu deaths for the 2017-18 season was about 61,000, which is lower than the claimed number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that people were not afraid of the flu because the media did not tell them to be, which may not be a valid assumption as there could be other factors influencing people's fear or concern.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of flu deaths by providing an inflated figure, which is higher than the estimated number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for the stated number of flu deaths, such as the methodology used to estimate flu deaths and the potential underreporting of flu-related deaths."}
