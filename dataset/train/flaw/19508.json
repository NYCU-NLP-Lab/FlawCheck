{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks scientific evidence or explanation to support the idea that a camera flash can heat up a Sharpie pen enough to induce a shock.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shocks people are receiving in the videos are real and not staged or exaggerated.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the shocks shown in the videos are exaggerated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that people may be participating in the challenge due to their sensation-seeking personality trait, rather than the belief that it will actually result in pain.", "Understate": "There is no evidence provided to suggest that the shocks in the videos are underplayed or downplayed.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that some people in the videos may be better actors than others, indicating that the authenticity of the shocks may vary.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a brief camera flash can induce a shock through a Sharpie pen."}
