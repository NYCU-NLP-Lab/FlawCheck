{"Lack enough support": "The claim that a continuation of 'The Office' television series is in the works at NBC lacks enough support as it is based on an April Fool's Day joke and an Instagram post, neither of which confirmed the reunion of the cast.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the April Fool's Day joke and the Instagram post indicate a new season of 'The Office' when they were not official confirmations from NBC or the show's creators.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pagez.com later retracted their claim and admitted that they were wrong in reporting the return of 'The Office' in 2018.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the possibility of a reboot of 'The Office' by stating that there is a slight possibility, even though NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt stated that a new season was not currently in the works.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of confirmation and support for the claim by not acknowledging that the April Fool's Day joke and Instagram post were not reliable sources of information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the chatter about NBC potentially bringing back 'The Office' with a different cast could indicate a reboot or continuation of the series, but it is not currently confirmed or in the works."}
