{"Contradict fact": "The claim falsely states that President Trump issued an order authorizing the U.S. Treasury to freeze the assets of the Obamas and Clintons. The expert's verdict clarifies that Executive Order 13818 did not specifically authorize the seizure of assets belonging to former Presidents Obama or Clinton.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the order by suggesting that it targeted two former First Families, when in reality it targeted individuals involved in serious human rights abuse or corruption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that the Obamas and Clintons had their assets frozen. The expert's verdict provides information that contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the issuance of Executive Order 13818 is directly linked to the freezing of assets belonging to the Obamas and Clintons, without any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim may be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the executive order, as it falsely attributes the freezing of assets to the Obamas and Clintons."}
