{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the link between Senator Bong Go and the closure of ABS-CBN, as the quote attributed to him is false and the graphic has been doctored.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the closure of ABS-CBN was due to the network's failure to renew its operating license, not because of its anti-Duterte reports.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a doctored graphic and a false quote.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ABS-CBN's closure was solely due to its anti-Duterte reports, without considering other factors such as the network's failure to renew its license.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that ABS-CBN's closure was a result of its failure to renew its operating license, rather than being directly linked to its anti-Duterte reports."}
