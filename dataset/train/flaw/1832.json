{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the strength of Hurricane Irma by suggesting that it may become a \"Category 6\" hurricane, even though that category does not exist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a blog post by an end-time enthusiast and Republican candidate, rather than scientific evidence or official sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a new \"Category 6\" will be invented specifically for Hurricane Irma, without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the discussion of a potential new hurricane Category 6, which was already being discussed before the 2017 hurricane season and is related to the increasing strength of storms in the Atlantic due to climate change.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a five, and there is no official Category 6.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential power of Hurricane Irma by suggesting that it could become a \"super typhoon\" with sustained speeds of over 180mph, without acknowledging the potential for even stronger storms in the future due to climate change."}
