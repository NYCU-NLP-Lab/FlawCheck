{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that the unemployment insurance trust fund is \"broke\" and that the state is \"over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government.\" The expert's verdict confirms that New Jersey owes about $1.3 billion to the federal government, but it does not explicitly state that the fund is \"broke.\" However, it does mention that the fund has a negative balance due to the economic downturn.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that the trust fund is \"broke\" or that the state is \"over a billion dollars in debt.\" The expert's verdict provides more information and evidence to support the claim, but it does not provide detailed financial data or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the debt and the state of the unemployment insurance trust fund are solely due to the proposed legislation mentioned. However, the expert's verdict explains that the debt and negative fund balance are a result of multiple factors, including the diversion of funds and the economic downturn.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the debt and the state of the trust fund. It solely attributes it to the proposed legislation. The expert's verdict provides additional information about the historical factors and decisions that led to the debt and negative fund balance."}
