{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the Black Lives Matter movement and the attacks on elderly people. There is no evidence to support this connection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the attacks were carried out by a BLM hate group.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images are from the United States and that they depict attacks on elderly people for being white. However, there is no evidence to support these assumptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations for the images, suggesting that they are predominantly used to claim attacks on white South African farmers or immigrants in Europe."}
