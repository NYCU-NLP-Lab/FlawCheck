{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential for medical-grade marijuana to get a patient 'high' by stating that it will not get them high regardless of the level of THC, CBD, or any other compound in the plant. This is contradicted by the fact that THC is the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that medical-grade marijuana will not get a patient 'high'. It does not provide any scientific studies or research to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that medical-grade marijuana alone will not produce a psychoactive effect, regardless of the chemical content. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the potential interaction and effects of different compounds present in the plant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or viewpoints that contradict the claim. The fact that THC is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana suggests that medical-grade marijuana could potentially produce a psychoactive effect, depending on the level of THC present.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that THC is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. This suggests that medical-grade marijuana, with a sufficient level of THC, could potentially produce a psychoactive effect.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the lack of psychoactive effects of medical-grade marijuana by stating that it will not get a patient 'high' regardless of the chemical content. This exaggeration overlooks the potential psychoactive effects of THC and other compounds present in the plant."}
