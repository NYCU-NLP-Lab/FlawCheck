{"Exaggerate": "The claim in the mailer states that Amendment 8 would dramatically increase the number of students per class by at least 20% and that some classes will have over 30 students. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim in the mailer does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Amendment 8 will result in classrooms with \"30 or more\" students. It simply presents the claim without any further explanation or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim in the mailer assumes that Amendment 8 will lead to an increase in the number of students per class. However, it does not provide any explanation or evidence to support this assumption. It is presented as a statement without any further context or justification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim in the mailer presents one side of the argument against Amendment 8, suggesting that it will lead to classrooms with \"30 or more\" students. However, there may be alternative explanations or perspectives that could challenge or question this claim. The mailer does not provide any information about potential alternative explanations or perspectives."}
