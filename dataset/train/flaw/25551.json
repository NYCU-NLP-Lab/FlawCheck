{"Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of revenue proposed by the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan. The expert's verdict mentions that the plan's total deficit reduction would be $3,885 trillion, which is higher than the $2 trillion mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that the Simpson-Bowles proposal urged raising $2 trillion in new revenue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction proposal did indeed urge raising $2 trillion in new revenue, but this assumption is not supported by the evidence provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the claim and the expert's verdict. It is possible that there was a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the Simpson-Bowles plan's recommendations, leading to the claim being inaccurate."}
