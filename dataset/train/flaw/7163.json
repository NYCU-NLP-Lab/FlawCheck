{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the actions of Gov. Rick Scott by stating that he \"tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls.\" The provided information suggests that the state government did not have the power to remove people from the voting rolls, and instead, a smaller subset of potential noncitizens was sent to local supervisors for further investigation.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the accusation against Gov. Rick Scott.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Rick Scott intentionally targeted Latino voters with his voter purge efforts, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. Rick Scott's actions, such as a genuine attempt to address potential noncitizen voting."}
