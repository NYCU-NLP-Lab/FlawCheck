{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Hillary Clinton's vote on raising taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500. The expert's verdict clarifies that the vote was nonbinding and did not have any immediate effect on people's pocketbooks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Hillary Clinton voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500. The expert's verdict explains that the vote was part of a larger budget resolution and did not directly raise taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's vote in favor of the budget resolution translates to a vote to raise taxes on workers earning $41,500 or more. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the vote was nonbinding and did not result in any immediate tax increases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the vote was related to revenue projections and the expiration of temporary tax cuts, rather than a direct vote to raise taxes on workers earning $41,500 or more.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hillary Clinton has consistently stated her opposition to raising taxes on the middle class. The expert's verdict mentions Clinton's clear stance on not raising taxes on the middle class, which contradicts the claim made by the Republican Party of Florida."}
