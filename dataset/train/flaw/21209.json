{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Modi government has introduced a new law awarding death penalty for rape, when in fact, the law already exists and has been amended in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that the Modi government has introduced a new law awarding death penalty for rape.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video clip of President Ram Nath Kovind is referring to a new law introduced by the Modi government, when in reality, the video is about a law to punish child rape offenders.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the video clip is about a law to punish child rape offenders, not a new law specifically for all rape cases."}
