{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that a \"massive\" federal computer network will make medical records available to \"millions of people\" with a \"complete lack of privacy and confidentiality.\" This could be seen as an exaggeration since it implies that all medical records will be easily accessible to a large number of individuals without any privacy safeguards.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the proposed federal computer network will result in a \"complete lack of privacy and confidentiality.\" It does not cite any studies or expert opinions to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the creation of a national government computer network for medical records will automatically lead to a \"complete lack of privacy and confidentiality.\" It does not consider the potential security measures and privacy protocols that could be put in place to protect patient information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose of the federal computer network, such as improving healthcare efficiency, reducing medical errors, or facilitating better coordination of care among healthcare providers.", "Falters at times": "The claim suggests that doctors and hospitals who do not participate in the federal computer network will face \"stiff penalties,\" but it does not provide specific information or details about these penalties. This lack of clarity can be seen as a falter in the claim."}
