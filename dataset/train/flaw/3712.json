{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people on strike by stating \"250 million people on strike in India.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the strike was expected to have a turnout of 250 million people, but it does not confirm that this number was actually reached.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that \"the revolution will not be televised.\" It is a subjective statement without any factual basis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images provided are directly related to the farmers' protest, but the expert's verdict reveals that the images are from different events and protests, including a general strike and a Kisaan March.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the images, such as the fact that they may not be directly related to the farmers' protest but rather from other protests or strikes."}
