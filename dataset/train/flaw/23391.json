{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Elizabeth Warren was paid $400,000 to teach one class, when in reality she was paid more than $400,000 for her final four semesters and taught two courses during that time.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of how salaries for college professors are determined, suggesting that it is solely based on teaching classes, when in fact it takes into account multiple factors such as research, expertise, and influence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that Harvard University paid Elizabeth Warren $400,000 to teach one class.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the salary paid to Elizabeth Warren is excessive or unwarranted without considering the factors that determine professor salaries at prestigious institutions like Harvard.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Warren's salary was based on multiple factors and not solely on teaching classes, as well as addressing the allegations of hypocrisy and previous claims made about her pay while teaching at Harvard."}
