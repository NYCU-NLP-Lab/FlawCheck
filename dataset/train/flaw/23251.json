{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that several states allowed people to change their early votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the announcement made by FBI Director Jim Comey regarding reviewing emails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton directly led to states allowing people to change their early votes. However, there is no direct evidence or causal link provided to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that \"several states\" allowed people to change their early votes, without specifying the exact number of states or providing evidence for this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no states changed their election laws specifically to allow people who voted early for Hillary Clinton to change their votes. This contradicts the initial statement made in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a mixture of true, misleading, and inaccurate information. It does not provide a clear and accurate representation of the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why some states allow early voters to change their votes, such as existing election laws or policies that allow for such changes, rather than solely being influenced by the announcement made by FBI Director Jim Comey."}
