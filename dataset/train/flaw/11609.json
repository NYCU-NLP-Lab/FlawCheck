{"Understate": "The claim may understate the availability of healthy options in some Milwaukee neighborhoods by stating \"good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option.\" The expert's investigation found that there were indeed stores that offered apples, although not every store had them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that \"a bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple.\" The expert's investigation found that apples could be purchased for as low as 37 cents, which is comparable to the price of Cheetos.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the price difference between Cheetos and apples is the main factor influencing people's food choices. It does not take into account other factors such as taste preferences, convenience, or cultural factors that may influence food choices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of healthy options in some Milwaukee neighborhoods. It solely focuses on the price difference between Cheetos and apples, without considering other factors such as food deserts, limited access to grocery stores, or socio-economic factors that may contribute to the lack of healthy options."}
