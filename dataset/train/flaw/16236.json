{"Contradict fact": "The claim that there was a fly on Amy Coney Barrett's shoulder during her confirmation hearing is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the image showing a fly on her shoulder is fake.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or video footage to confirm the presence of a fly on Barrett's shoulder during the confirmation hearing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image circulating on social media is genuine and accurately depicts a fly on Barrett's shoulder. However, the expert's verdict states that the image is fake.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that flies have also landed on other political figures in the past, including Mike Pence, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton. This suggests that the presence of a fly on Barrett's shoulder, if true, would not necessarily be significant or politically biased."}
