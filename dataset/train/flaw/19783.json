{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of education spending proposed by Gov. Rick Scott, stating that it is the highest state funding level in Florida history.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual highest state funding level for education in Florida, which was in the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement about the proposed education spending being the highest in Florida history, as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all factors involved in education funding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the highest state funding level equates to the best or most effective education spending, without considering other factors that may impact the quality of education.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in education spending levels, such as changes in funding sources or economic factors."}
