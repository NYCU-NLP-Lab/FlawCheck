{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the leather products with mould are from Shoppers Stop in India, when in reality they are from Malaysia's Metrojaya Center.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential danger of visiting malls after the lockdown is lifted by stating that the fungus in the ducts will enter our respiratory system and lead to major infection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough support or evidence to prove that the mould on leather products in Malaysia was solely due to the lack of air conditioning during the lockdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the mould formation on leather products, such as other factors like humidity or poor storage conditions."}
