{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of terrorists apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border by stating that seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists are caught.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that seven terrorists are apprehended daily at the border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of individuals apprehended at the border includes terrorists, without providing concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the individuals apprehended at the border may not solely consist of terrorists, but also include individuals attempting to enter the country illegally for various reasons."}
