{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine by stating that they tried to \"rig the election\" by spending $1 million against the candidate in the last couple of days.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the intention was to rig the election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine were involved in trying to influence the Republican primary election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the contributions made by the Jobs and Opportunity PAC, such as supporting the Democratic primary winner rather than trying to rig the election."}
