{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which \"almost all\" protesters in Madison are from outside of Wisconsin. The evidence provided only includes examples of labor groups and union leaders from outside the state sending people to join the protests, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the residency of all protesters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that \"almost all\" protesters are from outside of Wisconsin. The evidence provided only includes a couple of examples of out-of-state groups participating in the protests, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall composition of the protesters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the presence of out-of-state protesters in Madison. The evidence suggests that labor groups and union leaders from outside of Wisconsin have been sending people to join the protests, but it does not explore other potential reasons for the out-of-state participation, such as individuals independently choosing to travel to Madison to show their support."}
