{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that protesters \"stormed\" and \"broke in and down\" the White House. The video does not show any evidence of protesters entering the White House.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or confirmation that the video shows protesters at the White House. The video actually shows protesters at the Ohio Statehouse.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows protesters at the White House based on the presence of certain buildings in the background. However, this is a problematic assumption as it does not provide conclusive evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, which is that it shows protesters at the Ohio Statehouse rather than the White House."}
