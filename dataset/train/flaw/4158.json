{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that the Obama administration \"stopped testing\" during the H1N1 pandemic is an exaggeration. Testing did continue, although individual reporting was halted after a few months.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to substantiate the assertion that testing was completely stopped during the H1N1 pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the halt in individual reporting of H1N1 cases equates to a complete stoppage of testing, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the comparison between H1N1 and COVID-19 is misleading because the two viruses are very different. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the differences in testing approaches between the two pandemics.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some testing did continue during the H1N1 pandemic, albeit with a halt in individual reporting.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of testing for COVID-19 compared to H1N1. The expert's verdict emphasizes that testing is critical for contact tracing and isolation in controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is far more deadly than H1N1.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making false statements, such as President Trump's assertion that the U.S. has one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates."}
