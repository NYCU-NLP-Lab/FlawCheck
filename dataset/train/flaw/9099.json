{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Tommy Thompson \"says he\u2019ll do away with Medicare\" is partially accurate, as Thompson actually said he wants to \"do away with Medicaid and Medicare.\" The claim exaggerates Thompson's statement by omitting the mention of Medicaid.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a partial quote and does not provide further evidence or context for Thompson's statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Thompson's statement about doing away with Medicaid and Medicare translates to doing away with Medicare entirely. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the possibility that Thompson was referring to reforming or restructuring the program rather than eliminating it completely.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Thompson's statement, such as him expressing support for a specific policy proposal or discussing potential changes to the Medicare program. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
