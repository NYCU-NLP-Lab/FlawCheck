{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Tarkanian's stance on abortion by stating that he would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest. This is an extreme position that may not accurately reflect his views.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Tarkanian's position on abortion by not fully acknowledging his consistent opposition to abortion except in cases where the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tarkanian's stance on defunding Planned Parenthood automatically translates to outlawing a woman's right to choose. This assumption may not be entirely accurate as Tarkanian's opposition to funding Planned Parenthood does not necessarily mean he would outlaw abortion entirely.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or specific quotes from Tarkanian to fully support the assertion that he would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest. More direct statements from Tarkanian on this specific issue would be needed to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Tarkanian's stance on abortion, such as potential religious or ethical beliefs that may inform his position. This omission leaves room for alternative explanations that could provide a more nuanced understanding of his views."}
