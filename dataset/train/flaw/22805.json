{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Arizona immigration law by stating that police can't stop someone to check their immigration status unless they think they see something illegal. The expert's verdict suggests that the law does allow for questioning individuals about their immigration status under certain circumstances, such as if they are stopped for another offense like speeding.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential for racial profiling and abuse of power by police officers under the new Arizona immigration law. The expert's verdict mentions concerns about police abuses and the potential for racial profiling, indicating that the claim may not fully address these issues.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully explain the provisions and implications of the new Arizona immigration law. The expert's verdict provides additional context and quotes from a discussion between different individuals, suggesting that the claim may not provide enough evidence or information to fully understand the law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new Arizona immigration law prevents racial profiling and protects the innocent from police abuses. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there are concerns and debates about the potential for racial profiling and abuse of power under the law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim and the expert's verdict present different interpretations and understandings of the provisions of the new Arizona immigration law. This indicates that there may be alternative explanations and differing viewpoints on the law and its impact."}
