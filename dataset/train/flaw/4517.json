{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerated the situation by stating that the Obama administration issued a ban on sending Christmas cards to U.S. military members serving overseas. The expert's verdict clarifies that this is not the case and that families can still send mail directly to their loved ones in the military.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason behind the alleged ban on Christmas cards is to avoid offending Muslims. However, there is no factual evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that the Obama administration issued a ban on sending Christmas cards to military members overseas. The expert's verdict highlights that the article making this claim is from a satirical website and has a history of publishing false rumors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that families can still send mail directly to their loved ones serving in the military, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning the \"Holiday Mail for Heroes\" program and the possibility of sending holiday cards to U.S. military personnel through various Red Cross chapters. This suggests that there are alternative ways to send greetings to military members, contrary to the claim's assertion of a complete ban."}
