{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of a mother's kiss on a baby's brain by stating that it produces a \"chemical reaction that released a burst of oxytocin.\" The expert's verdict does not provide evidence or support for this specific claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that an MR image captures a mother's kiss producing a burst of oxytocin in a baby's brain. The expert's verdict mentions that the MRI scan featured in a meme captured the physical manifestations of affection and attachment, but it does not provide direct evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an MR image can capture the release of oxytocin in a baby's brain during a mother's kiss. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which focuses more on the use of MRI scans in radiology and the specific MRI image of a mother and her child.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the MRI image, stating that the image was created by overlaying an MR image with information from a functional MRI study. This suggests that the image may not directly represent the release of oxytocin during a mother's kiss but rather combines different types of visual images.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that MRI is primarily used for medical diagnoses and not specifically for capturing the release of oxytocin during a mother's kiss. The expert's verdict mentions that MRI scans are typically associated with detecting medical conditions such as tumors and injuries."}
