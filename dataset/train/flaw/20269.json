{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the change by stating that Urdu was completely replaced with Sanskrit on the signboard. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the board with the Sanskrit name was removed as soon as the matter came to light, suggesting that it was not an intentional replacement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Urdu was replaced with Sanskrit. The expert's verdict provides information from a report by Hindustan Times and The Times of India, which explain that the railway ministry decided to rename stations in Uttarakhand with names written in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit. However, there is no explicit mention of Urdu being replaced.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change of language on the signboard was recent, based on the belief of most people commenting on the tweet. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence from a report that the change occurred in February 2020 when the station re-opened for the public.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the change of language on the signboard was a result of the railway ministry's decision to promote the use of Sanskrit in Uttarakhand, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. It presents the change as a controversial event without exploring alternative reasons for the change."}
