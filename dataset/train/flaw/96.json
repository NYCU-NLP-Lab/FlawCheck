{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Pence that \"The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated\" is an exaggeration, as experts agree that while ISIS has suffered significant territorial losses, it is not completely defeated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide blast in Manbij, Syria, which killed four Americans. This contradicts the assertion that ISIS has been defeated.", "Falters at times": "Pence's assessment of ISIS being defeated falters in the face of the Manbij attack, as he later avoided similar phrasing and emphasized preventing the remnants of ISIS from reestablishing their caliphate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as experts on terrorism and foreign policy agree that while ISIS has lost significant territory, it cannot be described as \"defeated.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the defeat of ISIS is solely based on territorial losses, ignoring the fact that ISIS may intensify its campaign of terrorist attacks abroad as a response to losing territory.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the presence of troops in Syria was instrumental in keeping ISIS in check, as highlighted by the resignation of Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter ISIS, in protest of Trump's decision to withdraw troops."}
