The expert's verdict mentions the need for fact-checking and highlights the complexity of the agreement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that putting \"a lid\" on Iran's nuclear program is a significant achievement without providing further context or evaluation of the effectiveness of the agreement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding the effectiveness of the arms-control agreement. The details provided about the agreement and its limitations indicate that there may be differing opinions on whether it truly controls Iran's nuclear program."}
