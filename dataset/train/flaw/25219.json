{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the average cost of infant care in Georgia by stating it as \"almost $7,700/yr,\" when the actual average cost is $7,644/year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides the average cost of infant care in Georgia without any additional data or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison is between child care at a facility and in-state college tuition, without considering child care provided in a home.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative comparison of child care offered in someone's home, which is less than in-state college tuition."}
