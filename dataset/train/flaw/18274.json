{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difficulty of obtaining a Costco membership compared to getting a NYC Municipal ID. This is because the expert's investigation found that the process of obtaining a Costco membership is relatively straightforward and can be completed online, whereas the municipal ID requires some documentation and verification.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that obtaining a Costco membership is more difficult than getting a NYC Municipal ID.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difficulty of obtaining a membership at Costco is inherently greater than obtaining a NYC Municipal ID. However, this assumption is not backed by concrete evidence or a clear comparison of the two processes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation reveals that there are alternative explanations for the claim. For example, State Assemblyman Ron Castorina Jr. argues that the vetting process for a NYC Municipal ID is weak, suggesting that the claim's comparison may not be accurate or fair.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are 87.3 million Costco cardholders worldwide, indicating that obtaining a Costco membership is not as difficult as the claim suggests.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison of the two processes. It focuses only on the difficulty of obtaining a Costco membership without considering other factors or requirements for obtaining a NYC Municipal ID.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the ease of obtaining a NYC Municipal ID by not fully acknowledging the benefits and accessibility it provides to New York City residents, such as access to city programs and services, renting an apartment, opening a bank account, and complying with law enforcement requests for identification."}
