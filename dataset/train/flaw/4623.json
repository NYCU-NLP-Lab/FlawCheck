{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Cuomo ending cash bail by stating that the crime rate has gone \"through the roof,\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this extreme claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough empirical evidence or data to support the direct link between Cuomo ending cash bail and the increase in crime rates. The expert's verdict mentions that more data is needed to determine this connection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in crime rates in New York is solely due to the changes in cash bail laws, without considering other factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other societal upheavals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the increase in crime rates, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, education, and housing, as well as the release of some individuals from jails and prisons due to the threat of the virus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in crime rates is not specific to New York alone but is happening in many other cities across the country, regardless of whether they have implemented bail reform.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by attributing the end of cash bail solely to Cuomo, while it was a statutory change that took effect in January and involved multiple changes, including those made in the state budget finalized in April.", "Understate": "There is no clear instance of the claim understating any information or aspect."}
