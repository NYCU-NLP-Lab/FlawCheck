{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of requiring photo ID by stating that it would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting, while an even higher estimate of almost 400,000 people is cited in the proposed legislation's fiscal note.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on an estimate provided by State Rep. Kip Kendrick, who obtained the estimate from Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander's report. However, the report is two years old and may not account for certain factors, such as the cost of providing new photo IDs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the estimated number of Missourians who would be affected by photo ID requirements. For example, the Secretary of State's office compared the list of registered voters to the Department of Revenue's accounting of those without driver's licenses and those with expired driver's licenses, but it does not consider that some people without driver's licenses may have other forms of photo identification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that requiring photo ID would directly result in keeping Missourians from voting. However, it does not consider that some people without photo ID may still be able to vote using alternative methods or provisional ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that some individuals, such as those in prison or on parole or probation, are already ineligible to vote regardless of their ID status."}
