{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the promise made by the Obama administration regarding keeping unemployment under 8.5 percent if the stimulus passed. The actual projection was that the unemployment rate would peak just under 8 percent with the stimulus.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that the unemployment rate continued to rise after the stimulus plan was passed, contradicting the promise made.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only relies on the statement made by House Republican Whip Eric Cantor without providing additional evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the promise made by the Obama administration was a guarantee, when in reality it was a projection based on economic forecasts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative factors that could have influenced the rise in unemployment, such as unforeseen economic circumstances or the complexity of the job market."}
