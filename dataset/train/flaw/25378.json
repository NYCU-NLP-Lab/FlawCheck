{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children becoming victims of human trafficking in Ohio by stating that \"each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking\" without sufficient evidence to support this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the provided evidence does not align with the claim's estimate. The report from the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force and the statistics from the resource center do not come close to the estimate of 1,000 children annually.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by extrapolating the number of minor victims of sex trafficking in Toledo to the entire state of Ohio without considering other factors or demographics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the statistics and estimates provided in the claim, such as different definitions or criteria for identifying human trafficking victims."}
