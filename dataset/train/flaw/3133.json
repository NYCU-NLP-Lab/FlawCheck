{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the issue by stating that only pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are barred from maternity coverage. It fails to mention that this also applies to women who have coverage purchased on the individual market.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that pregnant women are barred from maternity coverage due to being considered a \"pre-existing condition.\" It relies on a statement from the president of the American Medical Association but does not provide additional evidence or statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are automatically considered a \"pre-existing condition\" and are denied maternity coverage. It does not consider the possibility that some insurance plans may offer maternity coverage, albeit at higher costs or with certain restrictions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the lack of maternity coverage for pregnant women on individual health insurance plans. It does not consider factors such as cost, risk assessment by insurance companies, or the varying regulations across states."}
