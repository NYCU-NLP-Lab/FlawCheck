{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the voter turnout decline by stating it was the lowest in 20 years, when in fact it was only lower than some specific years within that time frame.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that voter turnout was the lowest in 20 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that low voter turnout is solely attributable to Trump's victory, without considering other factors that may have influenced voter participation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lower voter turnout, such as changes in demographics, voter registration laws, or overall political engagement."}
