{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Roy Cooper's proposal by suggesting that he is advocating for \"free\" college tuition, when in reality his plan only covers community college.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that free community college tuition is already partially in place in North Carolina through the Career and College Promise program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Roy Cooper has not provided a plan to pay for the proposed free community college tuition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Roy Cooper's proposal for free community college tuition is the same as Bev Perdue's proposal for free college tuition, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Roy Cooper may not have explicitly stated how he will pay for the proposed free community college tuition."}
