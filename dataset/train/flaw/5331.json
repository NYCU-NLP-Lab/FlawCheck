{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that \"hundreds of people\" have been investigated and penalized for election fraud. The expert's investigation found that the actual number of cases reviewed and investigated by the Georgia Secretary of State's Office was in the range of 200 each year, which qualifies as \"hundreds,\" but it does not provide a specific number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the investigations and penalties are solely for election fraud, without considering the possibility of other violations or alternative explanations for the cases reviewed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate and specific information. The initial claim of \"hundreds of people guilty of election fraud\" is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack of alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cases reviewed by the Georgia Secretary of State's Office. It assumes that all cases are related to election fraud without exploring other potential violations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual number of cases reviewed and investigated by the Georgia Secretary of State's Office is in the range of 200 each year, not \"hundreds.\" However, the expert's verdict still rates the claim as \"True\" based on the broad definition of \"hundreds.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of election fraud investigations and penalties by using the term \"hundreds,\" which is not supported by the specific numbers provided."}
