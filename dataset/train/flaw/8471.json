{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that 32,400 votes were removed from Senator Perdue's vote tally live on TV, when in reality it was a correction of faulty data for one county.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides clips of election night newscasts that corrected two data-entry errors, which do not prove any widespread election fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the correction of the data-entry errors is evidence of election fraud, when in fact it was a simple mistake that was quickly corrected.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the change in vote tally was due to a correction of faulty data for one county, rather than intentional election fraud."}
