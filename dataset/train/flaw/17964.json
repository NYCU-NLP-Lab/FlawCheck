{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Quaden Bayles is an 18-year-old man who lied about being a 9-year-old boy with dwarfism to scam the internet for money. The biggest piece of supporting \"evidence\" is a photograph of the 9-year-old boy standing next to the number 18, which is not conclusive proof of his actual age or intentions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs of Quaden Bayles in more \"adult\" poses, as well as the photograph of him standing next to the number 18, are evidence of his true age and deceptive intentions. However, these photographs could have alternative explanations and do not necessarily prove the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the photographs and the suspicions raised about Quaden Bayles' age. For example, the photograph of the number 18 was taken at his friend's 18th birthday party, and the birthday message in another photograph is clearly for someone else, not Quaden.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Quaden Bayles received emotional and financial support from celebrities and online do-gooders after being bullied at school for being \"ugly.\" This contradicts the assertion that he scammed the internet for money.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of bullying on Quaden Bayles by reducing it to simply being called \"ugly.\" The expert's verdict mentions that he was bullied at school, which suggests a more significant and harmful experience.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making assumptions without sufficient evidence and by contradicting the fact that Quaden Bayles received support after being bullied. However, it is important to note that the claim is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, but it can be inferred from the information provided."}
