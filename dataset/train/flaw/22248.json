{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the proposed budget changes on pre-kindergarten programs by not considering the potential effects of lower funding levels and changed estimation methods.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence to fully substantiate the assertion that Gov. Bob McDonnell's budget would cut pre-kindergarten programs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may rely on a problematic assumption that the governor's rejection of a funding recommendation from the Board of Education automatically translates to a cut in the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the proposed changes to the pre-kindergarten program, such as budget constraints or a different approach to funding and estimation methods.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not thoroughly addressing all aspects of the proposed budget changes and their potential impact on pre-kindergarten programs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the governor's budget actually increases funding for the pre-kindergarten program in terms of raw dollars.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the budget cuts by not considering the overall funding levels and the potential impact of changed estimation methods."}
