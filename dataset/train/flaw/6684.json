{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which artists and musicians are paid when their music is played on the radio in other countries. The expert's verdict suggests that while many countries do have a radio-performance right, not all artists and musicians are necessarily paid for radio play in those countries.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of countries that do not have a radio-performance right. The expert's verdict confirms that besides the U.S., China, Iran, and North Korea are the only countries mentioned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"almost every other country in the world\" pays artists and musicians when their music is played on the radio. The expert's verdict mentions research compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America, but it doesn't provide further details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that artists and musicians should be paid when their music is played on the radio, without considering the potential impact on record sales or alternative compensation models. The expert's verdict mentions the industry premise that each time a song airs, the performer could get a lift in record sales.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why artists and musicians are not paid for radio play in the U.S., such as the potential boost in record sales. The expert's verdict mentions the industry's reasoning behind the lack of direct payment to performers."}
