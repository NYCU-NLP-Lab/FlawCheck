{"Understate": "The claim states that the mailboxes inside Disneyland are real and can be used to mail items.

This understates the limitations and functionality of the mailboxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that the mailboxes inside Disneyland are real and functional.

It assumes that they are real and functional. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the mailboxes were primarily intended for dropping off postcards and were not designed to handle official mail or important documents.
