{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin. The genetic testing mentioned in the claim is not supported by reputable scientific sources and lacks credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are not of human origin based on the DNA testing results. However, the assumption that these skulls are of extraterrestrial origin is not supported by scientific consensus and is considered pseudoscience.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing reliable and verifiable information. The announcement of non-human DNA in the skulls was made by individuals with questionable scientific qualifications and the results were not published in a peer-reviewed journal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The elongated shape of the skulls is most likely a result of artificial cranial deformation, a practice known to anthropologists. This alternative explanation counters the claim that the skulls are of alien origin.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the DNA testing results by stating that the mutations found in the samples suggest a completely new 'human-like being' very different from known human species. This exaggeration goes beyond the scientific evidence presented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts established scientific knowledge by suggesting that the cone-shaped skulls are of alien origin. The claim goes against the consensus that these skulls are the result of artificial cranial deformation, a cultural practice documented in various societies throughout history.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the provided claim."}
