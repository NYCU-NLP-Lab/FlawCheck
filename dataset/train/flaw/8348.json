{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of not taking a security detail. While it is true that Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera did not take a security detail, it is unclear how important or relevant this is in the context of his campaign for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio's seat.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion. While it is stated that Lopez-Cantera did not take a security detail, there is no further information or data provided to demonstrate the impact or significance of this decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not taking a security detail is a positive attribute or accomplishment. However, this assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation. It is not necessarily a universally agreed-upon measure of success or effectiveness as a lieutenant governor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Lopez-Cantera did not take a security detail. The claim does not explore or consider any other reasons or motivations behind this decision, leaving room for alternative explanations that may affect the interpretation of this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that previous lieutenant governors have had security details. While it is true that Lopez-Cantera did not take a security detail, it is stated that previous lieutenant governors have drawn scrutiny over transportation spending, implying that they did have security details."}
