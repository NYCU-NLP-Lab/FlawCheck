{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating because it states that \"each of the past three years has been the hottest on record.\" While it is true that the past three years have seen record-breaking temperatures, the claim does not provide evidence to support the statement that every single year within that period was the hottest on record.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that each of the past three years has been the hottest on record. The claim only refers to a news story about a candidate's response to a voter's concern about climate change and mentions a web post by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and a similar conclusion by NASA, but it does not directly provide the data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the past three years being the hottest on record is a direct result of climate change. While there is a strong consensus among scientists that climate change is contributing to global warming, the claim does not explicitly state this connection and may assume it without providing further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide alternative explanations for the record-breaking temperatures of the past three years. It solely focuses on the claim that these years have been the hottest on record without exploring other possible factors or variables that could contribute to the observed warming trend."}
