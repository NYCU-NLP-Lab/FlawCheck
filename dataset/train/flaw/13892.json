{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which illegal immigration has been cut at the southern border. While there has been a decline in border apprehensions, it is not clear if this can be solely attributed to Trump's policies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that the 61 percent decline in illegal immigration is solely due to Trump's election and actions. Immigration experts caution against assuming that declines have been solely a result of Trump's policies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in illegal immigration is solely a result of Trump's election and actions. However, there are other factors worth considering, such as increased enforcement efforts by Mexico and changes in smuggling routes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in illegal immigration, such as seasonal trends or changes in on-the-ground policies that may take longer to show results.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing specific data or evidence to support the 61 percent decline in illegal immigration. It relies on general statements and comparisons without providing a comprehensive analysis.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential increase in border crossers in the future, as the human rights situation in Central America is still problematic and Central American asylum seekers have been a main source of migration in recent years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the decline in illegal immigration is solely due to Trump's election and actions. Immigration experts caution against assuming that declines have been solely a result of Trump's policies."}
