{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the severity of the situation by stating that the bodies are \"stacked like firewood\" and implying that it is a result of the Duterte drug war.", "Contradict fact": "The claim falsely states that the photo was taken before Duterte took office in June 2016.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that the photo convinced Iceland to spearhead the resolution to investigate the Duterte drug war.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo is representative of the current situation in the Philippines without providing further context or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of bodies in the morgue, such as natural disasters or other causes of death unrelated to the drug war."}
