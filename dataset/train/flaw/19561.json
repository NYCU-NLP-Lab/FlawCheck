{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the comparison between Germany and the United States by stating that they are the \"two best\" in deaths per 100,000 people, which is not supported by the data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States actually has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 deaths per capita in the world.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that low per-capita death rates are a positive indicator, without providing any justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by the expert that Trump may have been referring to a different statistic, the observed case-fatality ratio, which would make his statement partially true. However, the claim does not mention this alternative explanation."}
