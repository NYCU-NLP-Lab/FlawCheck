{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Airbnb on real estate values and costs for workforce housing, as the evidence presented does not conclusively support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided by the expert does not sufficiently support the claim that Airbnb decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Airbnb and the negative impacts on real estate values and workforce housing costs, without considering other factors that may influence these outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The lack of available affordable rentals and rising housing costs may have predated the presence of Airbnb, suggesting that other factors could be responsible for these issues."}
