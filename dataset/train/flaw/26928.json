{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the lockdown on the return of wildlife, as the expert's verdict states that dolphins and swans swimming in Italy's waterways were not necessarily new phenomena related to reduced human activity during the COVID-19 lockdown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim of wildlife \"returning\" to waterways, ports, and canals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sightings of wildlife during the lockdown were a direct result of reduced human activity, which may be a problematic assumption as there could be other factors influencing the presence of dolphins and swans in the waterways.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the presence of dolphins and swans in Italy's waterways may not be solely attributed to reduced human activity during the lockdown, indicating the existence of alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a generalized statement that wildlife \"returned\" to all waterways, ports, and canals in Italy, without considering regional variations or specific locations where the sightings occurred.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that some sightings of wildlife, such as the swans in the canals of Burano, were real but not accurately described in the viral posts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that dolphins shown in a viral video were not swimming in the iconic canals of Venice, but off the coast of Sardinia, indicating a contradiction between the claim and the actual location of the sightings."}
