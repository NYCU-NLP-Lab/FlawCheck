{"Understate": "The claim may understate the coverage of abortion in private plans by stating that it is only \"in nearly 90 percent\" of plans, without providing a more precise figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a 2004 report by the Guttmacher Institute, which may not provide the most up-to-date information on abortion coverage in private plans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the coverage of abortion in private plans is representative of the coverage in plans offered on the federal health care exchange in Virginia, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the coverage of abortion in private plans may have changed since the 2004 report, making it less prevalent than stated."}
