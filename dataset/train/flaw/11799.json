{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"some people have to conduct repairs on machines used to help decompose sewage by diving into poop and other kinds of refuse.\" The only evidence provided is a Reddit image and a 2014 profile published by Vice that describes one person's experience as a sewage diver.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of one person's job as a sewage diver in Australia proves that \"some people\" have to conduct such repairs. However, there is no evidence or data provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why repairs on machines used to decompose sewage may be necessary. It only mentions the use of bacteria and stirring machines, but there could be other reasons for repairs, such as mechanical failures or maintenance needs.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence provided to contradict the claim that some people in Australia may have to conduct repairs on machines used to decompose sewage. However, without more information or data, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim."}
