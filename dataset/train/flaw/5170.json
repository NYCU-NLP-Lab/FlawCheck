{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Biden's great-great-great grandfather owned a slave is based on genealogy records from websites such as Ancestry.com and a slave schedule. However, the evidence provided is not explicitly linked to Biden's ancestor, Thomas H. Randle, and there may be a lack of sufficient supporting evidence to definitively prove the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Thomas H. Randle is listed in the U.S. Census and on an 1850 slave schedule as living in the same district as a man who owned a 14-year-old Black slave, it means that Randle himself owned the slave. This assumption may be problematic as it does not provide direct evidence of ownership by Randle.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the expert's verdict supports the claim that Thomas H. Randle lived in the same district as a man who owned a 14-year-old Black slave, there could be alternative explanations for this proximity. It is possible that Randle had some other relationship to the slave owner or the slave, such as being a neighbor or acquaintance, rather than being the owner himself.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the false rumor that Biden's great-grandfather was a slave owner who fought in the Confederate Army. This demonstrates that not all claims regarding Biden's ancestors and their involvement with slavery are true, and it is important to critically evaluate such claims.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not understate any biases in the provided claim."}
