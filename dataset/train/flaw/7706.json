{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the statement that Delta has had the most animal deaths among U.S. carriers in the past five years. It only mentions a Bloomberg news report without providing any additional information or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of animal deaths is the sole indicator of an airline's responsibility or care for animals. It does not consider other factors such as the number of animals transported or the airline's efforts to improve safety measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim mentions that mergers in the industry can skew the numbers, as Continental (now part of United) did not report zero animal deaths since 2011. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the number of animal deaths, such as changes in airline ownership or operations.", "Understate": "The claim does not mention any other U.S. carriers and their respective number of animal deaths, so it may be understating the issue by singling out Delta without providing a comprehensive comparison.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that Delta had 51 animal deaths in the past five years but had only 6 since 2013. This statement contradicts itself and may be misleading.", "Exaggerate": "The claim uses strong language by stating that Delta has had the \"most\" animal deaths among U.S. carriers, without providing comparative data for other airlines. This may exaggerate the significance of Delta's animal death incidents.", "Falters at times": "The claim mentions that Delta carried far more pets than other airlines in 2011, which may suggest that the number of animal deaths should be considered in proportion to the number of pets transported. This indicates that the claim falters in providing a clear and consistent argument."}
