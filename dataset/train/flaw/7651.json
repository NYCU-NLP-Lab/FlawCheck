{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that patients are being dropped from transplant lists solely because they are medical marijuana cardholders. The expert's verdict states that there is no national policy on this matter, and the decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that patients are being dropped from transplant lists solely because they are medical marijuana cardholders. However, the expert's verdict indicates that other factors may also contribute to a patient being rejected for an organ transplant, and the role of marijuana use can vary depending on the organ or amount of marijuana used.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for patients being dropped from transplant lists, such as other factors influencing the decision or variations in policies among different transplant centers.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the issue. The expert's verdict highlights the complexity and variability of transplant center policies regarding medical marijuana use and suggests that the claim may oversimplify the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of medical marijuana use on transplant eligibility. The expert's verdict mentions that some transplant centers do take marijuana use into account, particularly if it is excessive, indicating that there may be cases where marijuana use does affect a patient's eligibility for a transplant.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of discrimination faced by medical marijuana cardholders on transplant lists. The expert's verdict suggests that while some transplant centers do consider marijuana use, not all centers have a blanket ban on marijuana, and the majority do not exclude people for marijuana use.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts, as it highlights a concern raised by a senator. However, it may contradict the assumption that all patients on transplant lists are dropped solely because they are medical marijuana cardholders, as the expert's verdict indicates that other factors and variations in policies can play a role."}
