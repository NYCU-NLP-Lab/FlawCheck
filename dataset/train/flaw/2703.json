{"Exaggerate": "The claim of the big five oil companies making a total profit of nearly $1 trillion is an exaggeration, as the actual figure is closer to $900 billion.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the author of the report, Daniel Weiss, made a mistake while adding up the annual profit tallies, indicating a potential error or inconsistency in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support, as the actual figures from the companies' annual reports do not align with the $1 trillion profit claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the total profit of the big five oil companies being close to $1 trillion justifies the removal of tax breaks for oil companies, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the overall profit number for the oil giants may not be a useful metric to consider, as the size of the companies naturally leads to large profits. This presents an alternative explanation for the claim."}
