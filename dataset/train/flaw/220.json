{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that the sub-inspector was \"mercilessly beaten to death\" when there is no evidence to support this extreme claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that a Dalit protester was responsible for the assault on the sub-inspector.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos being shared are not related to the Bharat bandh protest but are from a separate incident in Uttar Pradesh.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos are evidence of the incident mentioned, without providing any additional context or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by News18 and Navbharat Times, which suggest that the sub-inspector either had a heart attack or was injured during the Bharat bandh protests, but not assaulted by a Dalit protester."}
