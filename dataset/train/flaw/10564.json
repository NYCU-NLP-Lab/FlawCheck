{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans infected after the polio vaccine by stating that 95 million Americans were infected, while the actual number is estimated to be between 10 and 30 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that the CDC admits 98 million Americans were given a cancer virus via the polio shot. The article relies on a supposedly censored \"grand admission\" from the CDC, but there is no credible evidence provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC is trying to censor information related to the contamination of the first polio shots, without providing any substantial evidence to support this assumption. The CDC's spokesperson denies any censorship and explains that website redesigns and updates are common.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the SV40 virus contamination in the polio vaccine was a result of the use of green monkey kidney cells in the vaccine-making process, which was a common practice at the time.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the SV40 virus has not been present in polio vaccines since 1963, while the claim suggests that 95 million Americans were infected after the polio vaccine.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of people affected by the SV40 virus contamination, stating that only between 10 and 30 million people were concerned, while the actual number is estimated to be between 10 and 30% of the 98 million people who received the polio vaccine during that time period.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and relying on questionable sources, such as vaccine.news, a website dedicated to questioning vaccination efforts worldwide. The claim also suggests that the CDC quickly took down a facts sheet about the SV40 virus, which is contradicted by the availability of the archived page in an internet archive."}
