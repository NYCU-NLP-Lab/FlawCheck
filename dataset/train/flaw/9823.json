{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential for hydraulic fracking to pollute groundwater, as there are some instances where contamination has been reported.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support, as there are conflicting views and evidence on whether hydraulic fracking has polluted groundwater.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation, as opponents of fracking argue that water contamination can occur as a result of the overall industrial process of natural gas extraction, not just the specific step of breaking the shale rock.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that hydraulic fracking has never polluted groundwater, when there are instances and evidence suggesting otherwise."}
