{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific information about where and when the photograph was taken, and there is no evidence provided to verify its authenticity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the photograph is actually Jeffrey Dahmer, but there is no definitive proof or identification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The presence of a Chi Phi fraternity sign in the background raises doubts about the claim, as Dahmer was not officially a member of any university organizations.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state that the claim contradicts the fact that the person in the photograph is Jeffrey Dahmer. However, it does cast doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph's association with the infamous serial killer stuck, but it does not provide a clear explanation as to why this association occurred or how it gained attention.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration bias present in the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not directly contradict any facts but raises doubts about the claim's authenticity."}
