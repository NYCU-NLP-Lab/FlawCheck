{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential for children to transmit the virus to others.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or studies to support the statement that young children do not spread the virus or get sick.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the studies conducted in other countries, where children have returned to classrooms, are applicable to the current situation in the US with high community transmission.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts point out that the transmission studies may include children who were more sheltered than usual, raising questions about the potential increase in transmission within the community and to school teachers and staff.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is evidence suggesting that children, especially younger children, may spread the virus less than adults, but questions remain.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the lingering questions and uncertainties regarding how much reconvening schools would increase transmission and the potential for severe disease in school teachers and staff.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement that young children do not spread the virus and do not get sick without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
