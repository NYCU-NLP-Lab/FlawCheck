{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Chris Christie \"has not increased taxes on anyone\" is an exaggeration because there have been tax increases for some New Jerseyans as a result of Christie's budget-cutting actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because multiple fact-checking groups, including PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, have debunked it and provided evidence of tax increases under Christie's administration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that only direct tax rate increases count as tax increases, ignoring the impact of budget cuts on tax relief programs and credits that indirectly affect residents' tax burden.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as experts argue that the cuts in tax relief programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and property tax relief programs, effectively resulted in tax increases for certain New Jerseyans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been tax increases for some New Jerseyans as a result of Christie's budget-cutting actions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it ignores the impact of Christie's actions on tax relief programs and credits, which indirectly affected residents' tax burden.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Christie's budget-cutting actions on certain New Jerseyans, as it fails to acknowledge the tax increases they experienced due to the reduction in tax relief programs and credits."}
