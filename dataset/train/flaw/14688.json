{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Texas Education Agency follows up on undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition to ensure they are applying for permanent residency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Texas Education Agency is responsible for verifying the application for permanent residency of undocumented students, which is contradicted by the TEA spokeswoman's statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact provided by the TEA spokeswoman, who states that the agency does not oversee the verification process for undocumented students' applications for permanent residency.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by suggesting that the Texas Education Agency is solely responsible for ensuring undocumented students are applying for permanent residency, without considering other relevant entities or factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability, as it relies on Governor Rick Perry's statement without verifying it with the TEA or providing additional evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the responsibility for verifying undocumented students' applications for permanent residency lies with other entities or organizations, rather than the Texas Education Agency."}
