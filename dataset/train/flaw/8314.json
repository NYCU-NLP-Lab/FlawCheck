{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential consequences of schools not opening and not being funded by suggesting that there will be no more teachers or school at all. This is an extreme statement that may not be supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that there will be no more teachers or school if schools do not open and are not funded. It is a broad and unsupported statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only way for teachers and schools to exist is through funding from the Texas Education Agency (TEA). This assumption may not take into account alternative sources of funding or other ways for schools to operate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funding requirements and guidelines set by the TEA. It assumes that the only reason for these requirements is to force schools to open, without considering other potential reasons or considerations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that schools can still offer online learning with attendance stipulations and receive funding, even if they do not open for in-person instruction. The claim suggests that schools will not be funded if they do not open, which is not entirely accurate based on the information provided.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
