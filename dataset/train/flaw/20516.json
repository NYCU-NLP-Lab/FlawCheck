{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money given to Iran, stating that \"$150 billion\" was given, while the actual estimates range from $25 billion to $56 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that \"we got nothing\" from the deal, as it fails to acknowledge the rollback of Iran's nuclear program achieved through the agreement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money given to Iran was a payment from the United States, while in reality, it was Iran's own frozen assets that were released.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the agreement accomplished the goal of rolling back Iran's nuclear program by stating that \"we got nothing\" from the deal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the released funds, such as Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of Iran's Oil Ministry."}
