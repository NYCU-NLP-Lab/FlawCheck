{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of police atrocities on Kashmiris protesting after Article 370 dilution, as it presents a video from a protest in Haryana as if it were from Kashmir.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the video depicts the oppression of Kashmiris after the dilution of Article 370. The evidence provided suggests that the video is from a protest in Haryana.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is evidence of police atrocities on Kashmiris without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the video is not from Kashmir but from a protest in Haryana, as indicated by the presence of \"Karnal Haryana\" on the side of a bus in the video."}
