{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of the media in creating the term \"polar vortex\" and its connection to the melting of ice caps.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of a polar vortex contradicts the idea of melting ice, without providing enough evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to back up the assertion that the polar vortex proves the ice isn't melting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim dismisses the alternative explanation that the polar vortex is a natural weather phenomenon, suggesting instead that it is a fabrication created by the media."}
