{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential job loss from raising the minimum wage, as the CBO report states that the number of lost jobs could range from a \"very slight\" decrease to a loss of 1 million jobs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the statement that raising the minimum wage would result in the loss of 500,000 jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CBO report's findings on the national workforce can be directly applied to Florida, without providing a state-by-state breakdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could impact job loss or gain, such as potential economic benefits or increased consumer spending resulting from higher minimum wages."}
