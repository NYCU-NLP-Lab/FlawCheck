{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Fox News changed their poll eligibility criteria. The expert's verdict mentions that Fox News provided a more detailed explanation of its selection rules in August compared to May, but it does not explicitly state that Fox News changed the criteria on the day they announced the candidates for the debate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Fox News changed their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced the debate participants. The expert's verdict mentions that Fox News provided a more detailed explanation of its selection rules in August, but it does not provide clear evidence of a sudden change on the day of the announcement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Fox News changed their poll eligibility criteria, but the expert's verdict suggests that Fox News may have reserved flexibility in their criteria and added more details based on the polls they received.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claim, such as Fox News reserving flexibility in their criteria and adding more details based on the polls they received. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim rather than a straightforward change in criteria."}
