{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"Corona is so bad, this guy died twice!\" exaggerates the severity of the situation by implying that one person's death is being reported as multiple deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the reported deaths are fake or overblown. The provided evidence confirms the authenticity of the reported deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the same person's photo was used in two different news articles, it means that the deaths are being falsely reported. However, it fails to consider that the person in question had a connection to both locations and therefore his photo could legitimately be used in both reports.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the same person's death was reported by different news outlets due to their connection to the individual, rather than any fabrication or exaggeration of the deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the reported deaths are accurate and confirmed by reputable news sources.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
