{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of debt in the budget over the next five years. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama's proposed budget would result in deficits of $5.08 trillion over five years, which is slightly different from the claim's statement of \"more than $5 trillion in debt.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the statement. The expert's verdict mentions news accounts and an article on Obama's proposed budget, but it does not provide direct evidence or sources for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that much of the current and expected deficits are due to economic troubles and not solely the actions of the White House or Congress. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in debt beyond the claim's implication that it is solely due to the budget.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of accurately presenting the full context and complexities of the national debt and budget. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama's proposed budget won't sail through Congress and that lawmakers have the final say. This suggests that the claim may not fully acknowledge the legislative process and potential changes to the budget.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any specific facts mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
