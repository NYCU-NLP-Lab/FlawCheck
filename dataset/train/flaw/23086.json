{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of cognitive ability showcased in the video, as the expert states that primates have not been recorded asking questions or expressing complicated thoughts through sign language.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to prove that the orangutan in the video is actually using sign language to ask for help. The expert mentions that although primates can be taught to answer questions through sign language, there is no record of them asking questions or expressing complicated thoughts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the orangutan in the video is using sign language to ask for help in stopping the destruction of its habitat. However, the expert's verdict does not provide concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the orangutan's behavior in the video, such as it being trained to perform certain actions without truly understanding the meaning behind them.
