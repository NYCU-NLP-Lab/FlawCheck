{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the vegetable shops were vandalized during the Indian farmers' protest in December 2020. The photo itself does not provide any context or clear indication of when and where it was taken.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the vegetable shops were vandalized by protesters during the farmers' protest, without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption. The photo alone does not establish a direct link between the protest and the alleged vandalism.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photo, as it was posted on Twitter in May 2020 by a politician from the Indian National Congress party, unrelated to the farmers' protests. This suggests that the photo may not be directly related to the December 2020 protests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo was posted on Twitter in May 2020, several months before the farmers' protests began. This contradicts the claim that the photo shows vandalism during the December 2020 protests.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexity of the situation by attributing the alleged vandalism solely to the farmers' protest, without considering other possible factors or events that could have led to the damage of the vegetable shops.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it simply states that the photo shows vegetable shops vandalized during the farmers' protest. However, without sufficient evidence, it is difficult to determine the extent of the alleged vandalism or the direct involvement of the protesters.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and verifiable connection between the photo and the farmers' protest. The lack of supporting evidence and the alternative explanation raise doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
