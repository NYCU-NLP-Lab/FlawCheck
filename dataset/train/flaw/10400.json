{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the regulations on wooden cheese boards by stating that they help make \"tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year.\" This may overstate the importance of wooden cheese boards in cheese production.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of other stakeholders, such as the Wisconsin dairy industry, in pressuring the FDA to reverse their decision on wooden cheese boards.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Tammy Baldwin played a significant role in eliminating the regulations on wooden cheese boards.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of wooden cheese boards is essential for cheese aging and that the FDA's attempt to prohibit their use was unfounded. However, it does not provide enough information to evaluate the validity of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the FDA's decision to back down on restricting the use of wooden boards for aging, such as scientific research or input from other stakeholders."}
