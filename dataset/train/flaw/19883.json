{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the problem by stating that some states hit hardest by opioid deaths have more opioid prescriptions than residents. This implies that there is an excessive number of prescriptions in these states, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that some states hit hardest by opioid deaths have more opioid prescriptions than residents. It only mentions that eight states reported more prescriptions than residents in 2015, without providing further context or comparison to other states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of opioid prescriptions is directly linked to the number of opioid deaths. While there may be a correlation, it does not necessarily mean that one directly causes the other. Other factors such as drug misuse, availability, and treatment options may also contribute to the opioid crisis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high rate of opioid-related deaths in some states. It solely focuses on the number of prescriptions as a possible cause, without exploring other factors such as drug trafficking, socioeconomic conditions, or healthcare access.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting conflicting information. For example, it mentions that Alabama had a lower rate of opioid-related deaths than most other states, despite having a high number of prescriptions. This contradiction raises questions about the direct relationship between prescriptions and deaths.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the opioid crisis by solely attributing it to the number of prescriptions. It overlooks other contributing factors such as illicit drug use, addiction, and mental health issues, which play a significant role in the opioid epidemic."}
