{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of private-sector job losses during Corzine's last year in office. The expert's analysis shows that the actual net loss was 115,700 jobs, while the claim states it as 119,000 jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job losses during Corzine's last year in office can be solely attributed to him. The expert's analysis highlights the presence of a recession during that period, indicating that there may be alternative factors contributing to the job losses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that these job losses should be labeled as \"Corzine job losses of 2009.\" The expert's analysis provides additional context and data from different sources, but it doesn't directly support the claim's labeling.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the job losses may have been influenced by factors beyond Corzine's control, such as the recession. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Corzine is solely responsible for the job losses."}
