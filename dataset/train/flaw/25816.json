{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the availability of cheap rice in the Philippines based on the photo and caption provided.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average retail price for rice in February 2019 was 45 peso per kilo, according to official government figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that there is \"lots\" of cheap rice in the Philippines. The only evidence provided is a photo of rice on sale for 35-42 peso per kilo, which may not represent the overall availability and price of rice in the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo of rice on sale represents the general availability and price of rice in the Philippines, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the photo, such as it being taken during a temporary sale or promotion, rather than reflecting the regular price of rice in the country."}
