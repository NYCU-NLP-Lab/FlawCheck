{"Lack enough support": "The claim that people convicted of felonies or under restraining orders can buy a firearm without going through a background check lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there are loopholes in state laws that allow individuals with criminal records or restraining orders to bypass background checks, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the ability of certain individuals to purchase firearms without undergoing background checks, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the effectiveness of existing background check systems and regulations in place, as highlighted by the expert's mention of the state Department of Justice handling background checks for handgun sales and the National Criminal Background Check Systems for long gun sales.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that background checks are required under federal law for purchases from Federal Firearm Licenses dealers, which covers a significant portion of firearm purchases.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which individuals with criminal records or restraining orders can easily purchase firearms without undergoing background checks, as indicated by the expert's mention of the existing two-pronged background check system in Wisconsin.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the existing background check processes and regulations in place, leading to potential biases or inaccuracies."}
