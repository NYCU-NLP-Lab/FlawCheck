{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that U.S. Navy SEALs acting under the direction of former President Donald Trump arrested Hillary Clinton without providing any evidence to support this.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to support the claim, so it could be argued that the claim understates the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the scenario.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites an anonymous source in \"Trump's orbit\" without providing any credible evidence or corroborating sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that former President Donald Trump has control over or a role in the U.S. military, which is a problematic assumption as he is no longer in office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the claim is a conspiracy theory and not based on factual information."}
