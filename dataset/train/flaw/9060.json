{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that NASA always receives blessings from the Pope before embarking on any space mission.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that NASA's strength and success in their missions are solely dependent on receiving blessings from the Pope, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The photos used in the claim do not show the Pope blessing astronauts before a mission, contradicting the claim made in the Facebook posts.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the Pope's blessings by not providing a comprehensive understanding of the historical context and frequency of such blessings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the Pope in the photos, such as symbolic or ceremonial gestures rather than specific blessings for a mission."}
