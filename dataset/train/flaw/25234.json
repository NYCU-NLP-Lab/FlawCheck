{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that investigators initially ruled that five Black men found hanging dead from trees died by suicide. The expert's verdict states that only three Black men were found dead hanging from trees, and in two of those cases, the initial manner of death was ruled as suicide. The manner of death in the third case is pending investigation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of deaths by suicide. The expert's verdict mentions that there were three Black men found dead hanging from trees, but it does not provide information about any other potential cases or deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the initial ruling that the deaths were suicides.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the claim, such as mistaking older incidents or gun deaths for hangings. It also mentions the case of Robert Fuller, where the initial ruling of suicide was questioned by the family and an investigation was urged.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all five Black men found hanging dead from trees died by suicide, without considering other possible causes of death or circumstances.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing accurate information or overlooking important details, such as the identification of the fourth death mentioned as a Latino man instead of a Black man.", "Exaggerate": "It is not clear if the claim exaggerates, as the provided information does not indicate any exaggeration. However, without more specific evidence or sources, it is difficult to determine if there is any exaggeration."}
