{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"overall revenues are up about 10 percent\" is an exaggeration as federal revenues have actually slightly declined since the tax cuts took effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert mentions that the White House did not provide any explanation or evidence to support the 10 percent increase in federal revenues.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the tax cuts are solely responsible for the strong economic growth and increase in revenues, without considering other factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that federal revenues have actually slightly declined since the tax cuts became law.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it cherry-picks one month of data to support the 10 percent increase in revenues, while ignoring the longer-term trend of declining revenues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in revenues, such as other economic factors or changes in government policies."}
