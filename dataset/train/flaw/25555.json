{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Joe Biden's support for \"defunding\" police agencies, as the expert's verdict mentions that Biden tried to align himself with protesters' calls for reforming the criminal justice system without going into specifics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples of Joe Biden explicitly supporting \"defunding\" police agencies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden supports \"defunding\" police agencies based on an unsubstantiated claim made by President Trump, without providing concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives, such as the definition of \"defunding\" the police provided by supporters, which suggests redirecting funds to other community needs rather than completely eliminating police departments."}
