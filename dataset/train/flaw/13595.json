{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which green cards are not based on job skills or economic need. The expert's verdict mentions that \"almost none\" of the green cards are based on these factors, which implies a very low percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that \"almost none\" of the green cards are based on job skills or economic need. The expert's verdict mentions data from the Department of Homeland Security supporting the claim, but the specific numbers or percentages are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current legal immigration system is not working for American workers and that the competition for blue-collar jobs from immigrants is putting downward pressure on working-class wages. These assumptions may be debatable and subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the issuance of green cards, such as humanitarian reasons, diversity visa lottery immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, which are excluded from the limit counts.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its generalization that \"almost none\" of the green cards are based on job skills or economic need. It does not account for the employment-based preference immigrants category, which accounts for about 140,000 green cards issued annually.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a significant portion of green cards, about two-thirds, are given to individuals with a family relationship with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. This contradicts the claim that \"almost none\" of the green cards are based on job skills or economic need.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of employment-based green cards by stating that \"almost none\" are based on job skills or economic need. The expert's verdict mentions the existence of a category specifically for employment-based preference immigrants, which indicates that a significant number of green cards are indeed based on job skills."}
