{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of the graduating class of 2012 who have smoked marijuana or done illegal drugs. The expert's verdict provides data from the CDC and the National Institutes of Health that suggest lower percentages of high school seniors who have tried marijuana or used illicit drugs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the stated percentage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that 50% of the graduating class of 2012 will have smoked marijuana or done illegal drugs without providing any basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could influence the percentage of high school seniors who have tried marijuana or used illegal drugs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the data provided by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, which suggest lower percentages of high school seniors who have tried marijuana or used illicit drugs.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by making a generalization about the entire graduating class of 2012 without considering individual variations and differences in drug use.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the percentage of high school seniors who have tried marijuana or used illegal drugs, as the data provided by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health suggest higher percentages than the claim implies."}
