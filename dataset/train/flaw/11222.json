{"Falters at times": "The claim suggests that Sen. Lindsey Graham \"tried to manipulate vote counts\" in Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona. However, the expert's verdict includes statements from Graham denying this accusation and stating that he was simply trying to understand the state's signature-matching requirements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Graham's phone calls were an attempt to manipulate vote counts. However, the expert's verdict includes Graham's explanation that he was seeking information on how to verify signatures on mail-in ballots and protect the integrity of mail-in voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation that Graham tried to manipulate vote counts. The expert's verdict includes Graham's denial and explanation of his intentions, as well as the lack of response from Occupy Democrats, the source of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for Graham's phone calls, suggesting that he was seeking information on signature verification and ballot integrity rather than attempting to manipulate vote counts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Graham's denial and explanation of his intentions, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it accuses Graham of trying to manipulate vote counts in multiple states without providing concrete evidence to support this accusation.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
