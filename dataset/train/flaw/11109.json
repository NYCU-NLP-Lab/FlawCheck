{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Muslim women in Dubai are singing Ram Bhajan and their husbands are supporting them, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that Muslim women in Dubai are indeed singing bhajans inside a mosque.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if this had happened in India, Islam would be in danger, without providing any basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the video, such as it being a cultural event or a private gathering, rather than a widespread practice among Muslim women in Dubai."}
