{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Gov. Bruce Rauner has \"created no jobs over the past three years\" is an exaggeration because there has been job growth during his time in office, although it may not be as robust as the national average.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the federal job data that show employment gains in Illinois during Rauner's tenure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that job growth under Rauner should have been at the national average or higher, which may not be a fair or realistic expectation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the fact that job growth in Illinois has been slower compared to neighboring states and the national average, which could be attributed to various factors beyond the control of the governor."}
