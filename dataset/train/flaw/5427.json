{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Florida's rankings in fourth grade reading and math scores, eighth grade reading, high school AP classes, and college education by stating that they are all ranked first in the nation, when in fact they are not.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Florida is not ranked first in any subject or grade according to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) data.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual rankings of Florida in the NAEP report, which ranks Florida fifth in fourth grade reading, seventh in fourth grade math, and 25th in eighth grade reading.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its statements of being ranked first in various education categories. The evidence provided by the Scott campaign spokesperson does not support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being \"most improved\" in certain metrics equates to being \"first\" or \"best,\" which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for Florida's improvement in certain metrics, such as other states also improving in fourth and eighth grade reading, and Florida being the only state to improve across those three specific metrics from 2015 to 2017."}
