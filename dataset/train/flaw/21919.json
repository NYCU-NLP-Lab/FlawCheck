{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of health care law requirements on a company with 20 employees, suggesting that they will go out of business solely because of these requirements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care law requirements to buy insurance will directly lead to a company going out of business, without considering alternative factors or options.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a company with 20 employees will be unable to afford health care for anybody and will go out of business.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees are not required to offer coverage under the health care law. This challenges the claim's assumption that the requirements will directly lead to business closure."}
