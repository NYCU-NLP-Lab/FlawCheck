{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the cost of fixing a single ditch in Pinellas County by stating it would cost $31 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is little consensus on how the Environmental Protection Agency is actually changing the rules and the estimate of $31 million is based on an old assessment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new federal regulation will require Pinellas County to spend $31 million to fix a single ditch, without providing sufficient evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the estimated cost of $31 million, such as differing interpretations of the Clean Water Act and the proposed rule change by the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers."}
