{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshis in India by stating that there are 11 crores (110 million) of them, while the available data suggests a much smaller number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there are 11 crore Rohingyas and Bangladeshis in India. The available data suggests a much smaller number of Rohingya refugees in India.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in petrol-diesel prices and the increase in the population of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis in India are related, without providing any evidence or logical connection between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in petrol-diesel prices and the presence of Rohingya refugees in India, such as global economic factors or geopolitical issues, which are not considered or explored in the claim."}
