{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it only mentions that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said \"unemployment could top 9 percent in 2013\" without providing further evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by presenting the CBO's benchmark unemployment figure of 9.2 percent as a forecast, when in reality, the CBO states that benchmark numbers are not forecasts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the CBO's projections are based on specific assumptions and scenarios, such as the extension of tax cuts and the avoidance of automatic spending reductions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CBO's benchmark unemployment figure is not a forecast but rather a benchmark against which potential policy changes can be measured.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the CBO's projections and the various factors that can influence unemployment rates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the CBO's methodology and the limitations of its projections.", "Exaggerate": "It is difficult to determine if the claim exaggerates because it does not provide enough information to evaluate the accuracy or significance of the CBO's projection."}
