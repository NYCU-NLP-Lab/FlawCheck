{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the minimum wage is an entry-level wage for young people, as the data shows that only 20% of individuals earning hourly wages are ages 16-24, and they make up half of all individuals earning at or below the minimum wage.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the diversity of minimum wage workers by focusing primarily on young people and not acknowledging the range of age groups that earn the minimum wage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the minimum wage is primarily earned by young people without providing evidence or considering other factors such as the prevalence of adults earning the minimum wage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the composition of minimum wage workers, such as adults who may be working multiple minimum wage jobs to support their families."}
