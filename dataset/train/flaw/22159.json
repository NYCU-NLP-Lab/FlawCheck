{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the success of Blue Cross Blue Shield in the Florida marketplace by presenting it as a \"success story\" and implying that it is proof that the Affordable Care Act works.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to validate the statement that Blue Cross Blue Shield ended \"2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace.\" The evidence provided only mentions that Florida Blue had 940,000 ACA members at the end of the open enrollment season, which falls short of the claimed number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the success of Blue Cross Blue Shield in Florida is representative of the overall success of the Affordable Care Act, without considering the performance of other insurers in different states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that the success of Blue Cross Blue Shield in Florida may not be indicative of the performance of other Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers in different states, such as the example of North Carolina where the company faced significant financial losses."}
