{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the actions of the CIA security team by stating that they \"defied stand-down orders\" during the Benghazi attack. The expert's verdict mentions that the security team was told to wait, but whether they were ever explicitly told to stand down is a matter of debate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the CIA security team actually defied stand-down orders. The expert's verdict mentions that the security team was told to wait, but it does not provide concrete evidence of them defying any specific orders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions of the CIA security team directly led to saving American lives during the Benghazi attack. However, the expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the security team was told to wait for reasons explained in the report. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for their actions, rather than simply defying stand-down orders."}
