{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the study by stating that \"95% of the ocean's plastic pollution comes from just ten rivers,\" when the study actually estimated that 88 to 95 percent of the plastic transported by 1,350 large rivers around the world comes from only 10 rivers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any additional evidence or sources to back up the assertion that 90 percent of plastic in the world's oceans comes from ten rivers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the study's findings on river-borne waste can be directly applied to the entire plastic load polluting the oceans, which is a problematic assumption as the study does not attempt to compare the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for plastic pollution in the oceans, such as sources other than rivers, which the study itself acknowledges.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study did not conclude that 10 rivers transport 88 to 95 percent of the total plastic load found in the oceans, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the study's findings and misinterpreting a section of the study that refers to the percentage of plastic load transported by the top-ranked rivers.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of rivers in transporting plastic waste by stating that \"90 percent of plastic in the world's oceans comes from ten rivers,\" when the study estimates that 88 to 95 percent of riverine waste comes from these rivers."}
