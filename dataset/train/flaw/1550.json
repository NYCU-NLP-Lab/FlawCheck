{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Affordable Care Act by stating that it is causing \"double-digit premium increases\" for all families, when in reality, the rate hikes are not universal and vary by state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Affordable Care Act is causing double-digit premium increases for families. The evidence provided only shows that some states experienced rate increases in the double digits, while others saw reduced rates or smaller increases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any premium increase in the double digits can be solely attributed to the health care law itself, without considering other factors that may contribute to the rate hikes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the premium increases, such as changes in the overall healthcare market or other external factors that may impact insurance premiums.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that most people get their insurance through their employer or other government programs, not the federal exchange, and the average premium increase for employer-sponsored plans is only 4 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the Affordable Care Act by focusing only on the double-digit premium increases and not considering other aspects of the law that may have positive effects on families' healthcare choices and access."}
