{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that New Jersey taxpayers will now face the highest tolls in the country, when there are other roads that charge more than both the Parkway and Turnpike.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that New Jersey will have the highest tolls in the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the highest tolls in the country are solely determined by the increase in toll prices on the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway, without considering other factors such as cost per mile or actual toll prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations to the claim, as there are other roads in different states that charge more per mile than the Parkway and Turnpike in New Jersey.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that tolls are not increasing on the Atlantic City Expressway, which undermines the overall argument made by the claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the toll prices on other roads in the country, such as Route 73 in California, the Dulles Greenway in Virginia, and E-470 in Colorado, which have higher toll rates per mile compared to the Parkway and Turnpike in New Jersey.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of toll rates across the country and only focusing on specific roads in New Jersey."}
