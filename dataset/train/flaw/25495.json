{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Democratic leaders are not wearing masks or social distancing in private. The expert's verdict provides evidence that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been a strong supporter of masks and has been seen wearing them in public appearances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a single picture from December 2019 to make a broad generalization about the behavior of Democratic leaders. The expert's verdict provides additional context and evidence to counter the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Democratic leaders are not following COVID-19 precautions in private based on a single picture. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies a conspiracy theory that suggests Democrats benefit from the presence of the virus. The expert's verdict highlights the existence of alternative explanations for the behavior shown in the picture, such as it being taken before the COVID-19 outbreak and the implementation of social distancing measures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been a strong proponent of mask-wearing, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single picture from December 2019 to make a broad and unsupported statement about the behavior of Democratic leaders. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts the claim and highlights its flaws."}
