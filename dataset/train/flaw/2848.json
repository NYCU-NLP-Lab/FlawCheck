{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by stating that US students sang the Indian national anthem to thank India for supplying HCQ.

However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video was created to celebrate global freedom and diversity, as stated in its description on YouTube. It has no connection to the supply of HCQ by India to the US.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was uploaded three years ago by a YouTuber named Anita Dixit (Rickshawali) to celebrate the Indian independence day, not as a show of thanks for HCQ supply.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in the provided claim."}
