{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that CBI chief Alok Verma held a domestic help captive at his residence. The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that the claim is based on premature and speculative reporting by Dainik Bhaskar.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the accused in the human smuggling case, who shares the same name as CBI chief Alok Verma, is indeed the same person.

The expert's verdict highlights that Dainik Bhaskar's reportage was based on mere speculations and that Verma had no involvement in the case.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Alok Verma held the domestic help captive at his residence. The expert's verdict indicates that the claim was based on misreporting and gave a fictitious angle to the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the alternative explanation for the claim is that Dainik Bhaskar misreported the incident and falsely implicated CBI chief Alok Verma based on mere speculations and a shared name with the accused in the human smuggling case."}
