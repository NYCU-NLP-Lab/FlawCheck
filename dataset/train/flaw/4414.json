{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not tweet the statement mentioned in the claim. The expert's verdict states that the image of the tweet is fake.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or proof provided to support the statement made by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if people had electric cars, they wouldn't face issues during a hurricane. This assumption may not be accurate as electric cars also require power to charge and may face other limitations during a natural disaster.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for people filling up their cars with gas before a hurricane, such as the need for transportation if evacuation is required or the potential scarcity of fuel during and after the storm."}
