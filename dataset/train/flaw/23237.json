{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Mayor Bloomberg was \"busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crisis in 2008.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Bloomberg did not explicitly blame any minority group.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mayor Bloomberg's statements about redlining and the housing market collapse were directed specifically at African Americans and Latinos, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict explains that Bloomberg's statements were more focused on the broader impact of redlining and loose lending.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Mayor Bloomberg was blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crisis. The expert's verdict provides evidence to the contrary, showing that Bloomberg's statements were not racially targeted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mayor Bloomberg's statements about redlining and the housing market collapse. The expert's verdict suggests that Bloomberg's remarks may have been naive or lacking acknowledgment of the discriminatory impact, but not necessarily blaming specific racial groups."}
