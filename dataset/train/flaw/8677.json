{"Understate": "The claim suggests that water usage in Georgia dropped between 1980 and 2010, but the expert's verdict highlights several issues related to water scarcity and increased costs, indicating that the claim may understate the challenges faced by the state.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides some evidence to support the claim, such as the 30% drop in water usage between 1980 and 2010. However, it does not provide extensive data or additional sources to fully support the claim, suggesting a lack of enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drop in water usage is solely due to conservation efforts, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decrease. The expert's verdict mentions the decommissioning of facilities during the drought years, which could have influenced the decline in water usage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions various factors that could explain the drop in water usage, such as increased water/sewer rates, federally mandated upgrades, and the \"water war\" with Alabama and Florida. These alternative explanations suggest that the claim may not provide the full picture.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that water usage in Georgia dropped between 1980 and 2010, but the expert's verdict mentions that no major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought, indicating a contradiction in terms of infrastructure development to address water shortages.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was surprising given the challenges and issues related to water in Georgia, suggesting that the claim may falter at times in accurately representing the overall situation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim or the expert's verdict."}
