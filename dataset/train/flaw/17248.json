{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of income that comes from abortions by stating that \"almost 37 percent\" of Planned Parenthood's total income is from abortions, when the actual percentage is much lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 37 percent of Planned Parenthood's income is from abortions. The source cited by the expert does not provide comprehensive information or data to verify this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Planned Parenthood needs to perform abortions in order to stay in business, without providing evidence or considering alternative sources of income for the organization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the income generated by Planned Parenthood, such as government funding, grants, or other healthcare services provided by the organization.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Stephanie Kunkel, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, who stated that 97 percent of the services provided by Planned Parenthood in Florida are prevention and education, not abortions."}
