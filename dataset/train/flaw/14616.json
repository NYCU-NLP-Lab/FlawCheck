{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Gov. Scott Walker's repeal of a 2009 law by stating that Wisconsin is now one of only five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck. However, there are existing laws in place that provide protections against gender-based employment discrimination and pay discrimination in Wisconsin.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the statement that Wisconsin is one of five states without an equal pay law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the repeal of the 2009 law by Gov. Scott Walker has left Wisconsin without any protections against gender discrimination in pay. However, there are other laws in place, such as the state Fair Employment Act, that explicitly prohibit gender-based employment discrimination in compensation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that even without a specific equal pay law, existing laws in Wisconsin, such as the state Fair Employment Act, provide protections against gender-based employment discrimination and pay discrimination.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wisconsin already has protections against gender-based employment discrimination and pay discrimination in the state Fair Employment Act, which has been in place since 1982.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a narrow view of the issue and failing to acknowledge the existing protections in place.", "Understate": "The claim understates the existing protections against gender-based employment discrimination and pay discrimination in Wisconsin by focusing solely on the repeal of the 2009 law."}
