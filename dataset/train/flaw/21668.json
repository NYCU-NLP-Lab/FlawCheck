{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that \"no mosque was set on fire in Delhi\" without considering the evidence of a mob vandalizing a mosque and placing a saffron flag on it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is evidence of a video showing a mob vandalizing a mosque, but there is also conflicting information and alternative explanations provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because no mosque was set on fire, there was no damage or vandalism to mosques in Delhi, ignoring the evidence of the mob's actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations provided, such as the claim that the video is unrelated to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and that it may be a two-year-old video from Bihar."}
