{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not a direct quote from Joe Biden and appears to be a loose paraphrasing of his explanation regarding his sealed senatorial records.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden made a statement about not making his actions in elected office public while seeking a higher public office. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden called on the National Archives to release any complaint against him and denied a sexual assault allegation made by Tara Reade.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by simplifying Biden's explanation of his sealed senatorial records and their potential to be taken out of context.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of Joe Biden's statements and actions regarding his records.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Joe Biden wants to protect his sealed senatorial records from being used to harm his presidential campaign by being taken out of context."}
