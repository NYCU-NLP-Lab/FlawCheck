{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it falsely connects the man's distress in the video to the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that the man in the video was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the man's distress in the video is directly related to being added to the no-fly list, whereas the TikTok user who posted the video stated that he was upset because he was kicked off his flight for not wearing a mask.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the man's distress in the video, as it is suggested that he was upset about being directed to wear a face covering, not being added to the no-fly list.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the situation by not fully acknowledging the possibility that the man's distress in the video could be related to other factors, such as the enforcement of mask-wearing policies or other disruptive behavior on the flight."}
