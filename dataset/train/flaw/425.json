{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by stating that only 11 percent of child care providers in Texas are certified as meeting quality standards. It is possible that the actual percentage is even lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that only 11 percent of child care providers in Texas meet quality standards. It would be helpful to have more information on how this percentage was calculated and what criteria were used to determine quality standards.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that certification is the only measure of meeting quality standards for child care providers. There may be alternative ways for providers to demonstrate quality that are not captured by certification alone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why only 11 percent of child care providers in Texas are certified as meeting quality standards. Factors such as limited resources, lack of awareness, or challenges in accessing certification programs could contribute to this statistic."}
