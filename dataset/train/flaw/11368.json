{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential loss of oxygen in the world's oceans, stating that we could lose half of the world's oxygen, which is an overstatement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific evidence that shows oceans are projected to lose only 1%-7% of their oxygen, not half.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that half of the world's oxygen could be lost due to what's going on in the oceans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loss of oxygen in the oceans would directly result in the loss of atmospheric oxygen, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations provided by experts, such as the fact that even if nearly every living organism were incinerated, the oxygen concentration in the air would hardly decrease."}
