{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 3 million votes in the presidential election were cast by illegal aliens. The supposed report from VoteFraud.org does not exist, and the information comes from tweets made by Gregg Phillips, who is not affiliated with that website.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of various reports and investigations that have found very few cases of noncitizens voting. News 21 found only 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011, and the Brennan Center for Justice report states that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental and not done knowingly.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of noncitizen votes by stating that there were 3 million, without providing substantial evidence to support this number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the information from tweets by Gregg Phillips is accurate and reliable, even though he is not affiliated with VoteFraud.org and the report does not exist.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on unreliable sources like InfoWars, a conspiracy website, and Milo, TheNewAmerican, and FreedomDaily, which also touted the report without proper verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the supposed 3 million noncitizen votes, such as accidental registration or lack of awareness about voting rules among noncitizens.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
