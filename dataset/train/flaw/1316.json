{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the video shows a Rafale fighter jet performing stunts in the air. The evidence presented in the expert's verdict suggests that the video actually shows a toy aircraft produced by a US-based company called Flex Innovations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video depicts a real Rafale fighter jet, but the evidence suggests otherwise. The presence of the 'FLEX' logo on the tail of the aircraft and the availability of similar toy aircrafts for sale on the Flex Innovations website indicate that it is not a real fighter jet.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video actually shows a toy aircraft, not a Rafale fighter jet. The evidence from the expert's analysis and comparison of the video with the one published on Flex Innovations' YouTube channel supports this contradiction.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by describing it as \"Awesome!!\" and implying that it showcases impressive stunts performed by a Rafale fighter jet. However, the video actually depicts a toy aircraft, which may not be as impressive or significant.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the video or its content.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately identifying and describing the content of the video. It mistakenly attributes the video to a Rafale fighter jet, while it actually shows a toy aircraft.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that the alternative explanation for the video is that it shows a toy aircraft produced by Flex Innovations, rather than a Rafale fighter jet performing stunts in the air."}
