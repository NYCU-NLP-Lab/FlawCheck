{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Governor Cuomo \"established death panels and lotteries\" instead of buying ventilators, without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that Governor Cuomo rejected buying recommended ventilators in 2015.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Governor Cuomo had the opportunity to buy 16,000 ventilators at a very low price in 2015, without considering other factors such as budget constraints or the availability of trained staff to operate the ventilators.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 2015 New York state report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators and did not indicate whether the state had the fiscal capacity to purchase them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the state did not plan to increase its ventilator stockpile, such as concerns about shortage of trained staff and the prioritization of funding for ongoing healthcare expenses."}
