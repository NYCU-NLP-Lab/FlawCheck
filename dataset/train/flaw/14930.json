{"Understate": "The expert's verdict understates the potential impact of consuming hot cross buns on breathalyzer readings. While it is mentioned that \"trace amounts of alcohol in a subject's mouth would adversely affect accurate breathalyzer readings,\" the expert does not emphasize the extent of this impact or provide specific data on how much the readings could be affected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video posted by a trucking company on Facebook. The expert mentions that the UK tabloids extrapolated unsupported claims from this video, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the consumption of hot cross buns can affect breathalyzer readings. The expert's verdict clarifies that the ingestion of a hot cross bun would not trigger a false positive if the breathalyzer is used properly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the inaccurate breathalyzer readings observed in the video. The ingestion of food on the breath is suggested as a possible cause, rather than the hot cross bun specifically.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that properly performed breathalyzer tests rely on alveolar air directly from the lungs and assume no other source of alcohol in the mouth. The expert's verdict highlights that even trace amounts of alcohol in the subject's mouth can affect accurate breathalyzer readings.", "Exaggerate": "The claim is not found to exaggerate any information."}
