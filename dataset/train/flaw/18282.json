{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by suggesting that Trump wanted a \"military-style send-off, complete with a 21-gun salute\" on Inauguration Day. The evidence provided indicates that Trump wanted an elaborate ceremony, but it is unclear if he specifically requested a 21-gun salute.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide direct evidence or statements from Trump himself regarding his desired send-off.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump wanted a military-style send-off, but it does not provide clear evidence of his intentions or motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Trump's desired send-off, such as a desire for a grand farewell rather than a military-specific event."}
