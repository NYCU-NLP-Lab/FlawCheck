{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the endorsement of ICE and border patrol officers, implying that all officers unanimously endorsed Trump for president, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion of unanimous endorsement from ICE and border patrol officers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the endorsement of union leaders represents the unanimous endorsement of all officers, which is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that not all officers represented by the ICE union voted to endorse Trump, and some border patrol agents in Texas even opposed the endorsement."}
