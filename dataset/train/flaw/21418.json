{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it states that the number of terrorists has doubled, without providing specific data or evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that the number of terrorists has doubled.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the number of terrorist groups is solely attributed to President Obama's actions or policies, without considering other factors that may contribute to the rise of terrorism.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on the statements made by former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has a known bias against President Obama. This raises questions about the objectivity and reliability of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise in the number of terrorist groups, such as socio-political factors, economic instability, or regional conflicts."}
