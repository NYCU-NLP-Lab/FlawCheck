{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of mass shootings during President Obama's administration is vastly higher than any other recent president, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The sources listed by TruthStreamMedia.com do not back up their claim that a significantly larger number of mass shootings occurred during President Obama's administration compared to his four predecessors combined.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of mass shootings during President Obama's administration is not significantly higher than the combined number during the administrations of his four predecessors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using different standards for defining \"mass shootings\" during President Obama's administration, which distorts the comparison with previous presidents.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of mass shootings during previous administrations by not including incidents that do not meet the revised definition of a \"mass shooting\" during President Obama's second term.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the number of incidents classified as \"mass shootings\" during President Obama's second term, such as the change in the definition of a \"mass shooting\" event."}
