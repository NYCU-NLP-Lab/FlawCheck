{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of diseases coming across the border by using a photo from 2014 and implying it is a current issue.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the containment of the scabies outbreak in 2014 by mentioning only a small handful of border patrol agents contracting it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that immigrants bring infectious diseases across the border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigrants are the primary source of disease spread, while the Center for Disease Control attributes it to legal back-and-forth between the United States and Mexico.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the possibility that the spread of diseases is more likely from legal crossings and international travelers visiting other countries."}
