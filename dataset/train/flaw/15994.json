{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost of transporting the bird's carcass back to Finland, as the expert's verdict states that the Kenyan government did not plan to spend a large amount of money for this purpose.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading article that has since been taken offline.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bird's carcass would be sent back to Finland for burial, without considering alternative options or explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the bird's carcass was disposed of in Nairobi and the Finnish authorities were informed, contradicting the claim's assertion of sending the bird back to Finland for burial."}
