{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerated because it states that only two Border Patrol agents were hired with a $14.8 million payment, while the actual number mentioned in the expert's verdict is two accepted job offers, which includes a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $14.8 million payment was solely intended for hiring Border Patrol agents, without considering other expenses or services included in the contract.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why only two job offers were processed, such as difficulties in finding qualified candidates or issues with the hiring process itself.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered as understating the issue by focusing only on the initial payment and the number of hires, without providing a comprehensive analysis of the entire contract or the long-term goals of the hiring process.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the complex process of hiring Border Patrol agents and the challenges involved in recruitment and retention.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the contract was awarded to Accenture Federal Services, not directly to President Donald Trump, as stated in the claim."}
