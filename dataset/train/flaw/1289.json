{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the proportion of benefits that went to the wealthiest 1 percent. The expert's verdict states that the actual percentage is closer to 80 percent, not 70 percent.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim understates the actual percentage of benefits that went to the wealthiest 1 percent. The correct percentage is stated to be around 80 percent, not 70 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully back up the statement that 70 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent. The expert's verdict provides additional information and analysis to support a higher percentage of benefits going to the top 1 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Trump tax law disproportionately benefits the wealthiest 1 percent without providing sufficient evidence or context. The expert's verdict provides more nuanced information about the distribution of benefits across income groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict explains that the shift in the distribution of benefits occurs because most of the individual tax cuts end after 2025, leaving corporate tax cuts that primarily benefit higher-income earners. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the tax law primarily benefits the wealthy."}
