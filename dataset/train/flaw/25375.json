{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in gun crime prosecutions between the two presidents by stating it as a 30 percent decrease, which is not necessarily the best approach.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only considers a specific category of gun prosecutions (lead charges) and does not take into account the entire term of President Bush.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher prosecution of gun crimes under President Bush means they were specifically targeting bad guys, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in gun crime prosecutions between the two presidents that are not considered in the claim."}
