{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Ohio Gov. John Kasich is \"very unpopular\" may be an exaggeration based on the evidence provided, which includes positive approval ratings and support from some Democrats.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that Kasich is \"very unpopular.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations for Kasich's popularity, such as his criticism of Trump and support for Medicaid expansion, which have drawn support from some Democrats.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not acknowledge the positive approval ratings and support Kasich has received.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kasich's unpopularity was a significant factor in the narrow win by Republican Troy Balderson in a special election, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption."}
