{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it suggests that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects, monitors, and stores financial information of millions of Americans without their knowledge for up to 10 years. The expert's verdict indicates that while the bureau does obtain financial data from third parties without direct notification to consumers, there is no clear evidence to support the claim that it monitors and stores individual-level data for such a long period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the bureau is collecting and monitoring financial information without individuals' knowledge. The expert's verdict mentions that the bureau obtains data from third parties, but it does not provide concrete evidence of monitoring or lack of knowledge by individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is engaging in practices similar to the National Security Agency (NSA) by collecting vast amounts of financial information. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the comparison to the NSA is merely an attack tactic used by the person making the claim, and there is no evidence to suggest that the bureau's actions are equivalent to those of the NSA.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the bureau's actions, such as gathering information to better understand consumers and financial markets. This implies that the claim may not consider these alternative motives or explanations for the bureau's data collection practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the law creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau prohibits it from collecting personally identifiable financial information of consumers. The expert's verdict mentions this legal restriction, indicating that the claim goes against this factual information.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it combines accurate information about the bureau obtaining financial data from third parties without direct notification to consumers with potentially exaggerated or unsupported claims about monitoring and storing individual-level data for up to 10 years. The expert's verdict points out the accuracy of the first part of the claim but questions the validity of the rest.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
