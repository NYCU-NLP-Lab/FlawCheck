{"Falters at times": "The claim falters by incorrectly identifying the female fighter pilot involved in the airstrikes as Urvisha Jariwala, when in fact she is Sneha Shekhawat. This shows a mistake or error in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the photo shows the female fighter pilot who carried out the strikes in Pakistan. The evidence provided proves that the person in the photo is actually Sneha Shekhawat, but there is no concrete evidence linking her to the specific airstrikes mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo of a female fighter pilot in air force uniform wearing pilot glasses is proof of her involvement in the airstrikes in Pakistan. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation from the IAF or Indian government regarding the identity of the pilot(s) involved in the airstrikes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, which is that the photo is of Sneha Shekhawat, an IAF flight lieutenant, who has been incorrectly identified as Urvisha Jariwala. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim made in the post."}
