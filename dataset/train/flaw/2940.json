{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that a white family is \"likely\" to have about six times as much wealth as a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession. The use of the word \"likely\" suggests a generalization that may not be true for every individual case.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by a report from the Urban Institute, there is mention of debate among economists and social scientists about the most accurate ratio for the wealth gap. This suggests that there may not be enough consensus or supporting evidence to fully validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in wealth between white families and black or Hispanic families is solely due to race, without considering other factors such as income disparities, educational opportunities, or historical disadvantages. This assumption may oversimplify the complex nature of wealth inequality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The mention of different ratios for the wealth gap from various surveys and sources indicates that there are alternative explanations and interpretations of the data. This suggests that the claim may not fully account for these alternative explanations and may present a limited perspective on the issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it is based on data that varies depending on the survey used, year, and measure of average (mean vs median). This variability in the data may introduce uncertainty and potential inaccuracies in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the wealth gap between white families and black or Hispanic families."}
