{"Understate": "The claim may understate the objection from the attorney general to the parole of Alfred Brissette. The claim states that the parole board \"never received an objection\" from the attorney general, but the expert's verdict mentions that the attorney general's office issued a statement saying the Parole Board should have come to a different conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of objection from the attorney general is the reason for granting parole to Alfred Brissette. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the parole board considered factors such as Brissette's clean prison disciplinary record and participation in rehabilitation programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the parole board's decision to grant parole to Alfred Brissette. The expert's verdict mentions that the parole board considered multiple factors, including Brissette's behavior in prison and his participation in rehabilitation programs."}
