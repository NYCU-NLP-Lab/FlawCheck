{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the debt increase under both George W. Bush and President Obama by stating that they \"doubled\" the debt, when other factors beyond presidential actions contributed to the increase.", "Understate": "The claim understates the debt increase under President Obama by stating that it only reached $19.95 trillion, when it was actually slightly higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the statement that the debt is on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the debt increase is solely the result of presidential actions, ignoring other factors such as demographic factors, external events, and Congress's actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the debt increase, such as the impact of the Republican-backed tax bill and recent spending bill."}
