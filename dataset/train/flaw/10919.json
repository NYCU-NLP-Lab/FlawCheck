{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which women are being paid for protesting against the citizenship law. The video does not provide evidence of widespread payment to all women protesters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that women are being paid by the Indian National Congress party to protest against the citizenship law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows women being paid for protesting, without considering alternative explanations or verifying the context of the footage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video could potentially show a religious rite at a funeral in Manipur, as claimed by the Congress party spokesperson, rather than women being paid for protesting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is actually from a funeral in Manipur and not related to the Congress party paying women for protesting against the citizenship law.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any aspect."}
