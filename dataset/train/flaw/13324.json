{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Nancy Pelosi by stating that she removed a 150-year-old sign, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation that Nancy Pelosi removed a sign reading \"In God We Trust\" from the House Chamber.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nancy Pelosi is responsible for the removal of the sign without providing substantial proof.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the words \"In God We Trust\" have been visible above the rostrum inside the House Chamber since 1962.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The image provided in the claim is not related to the alleged removal of the sign but rather shows a sign being installed on a courthouse in Tennessee. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion."}
