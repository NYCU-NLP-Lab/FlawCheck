{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama\u2019s first term belonged to women\" is an exaggeration. The actual number is closer to 92.3 percent, but the claim fails to acknowledge that the percentage was calculated based on a specific timeframe and cherry-picked data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on outdated data from 2012 and does not consider the full extent of Obama's first term. The claim also lacks evidence to support the assertion that Obama's policies were \"demonstratively bad for women.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job losses during Obama's first term were solely the result of his policies, without considering other factors such as the economic recession that began before his presidency.", "Cherry": "picking: The claim cherry-picks the starting date for assessing Obama's jobs track record, only considering the period from January 2009 to March 2012. This selective timeframe skews the perception of job losses and ignores the subsequent improvement in employment numbers for women.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that by January 2013, the number of women with jobs had increased, and the overall employment numbers showed a net gain during Obama's first term.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual increase in employment for women by only focusing on the job losses during a specific timeframe and ignoring the subsequent recovery and growth in employment numbers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the job losses during Obama's first term, such as the impact of the economic recession that began before his presidency. It solely attributes the losses to Obama's policies without acknowledging other contributing factors."}
