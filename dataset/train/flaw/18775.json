{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the length of the Great Wall of China by stating it is 13,000 miles long, while the experts state that the most familiar and best-preserved portions of the wall are only 300 to 600 years old and much shorter in length.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement about the length of the Great Wall of China.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Great Wall of China was built 2,000 years ago, but the experts state that the better constructed portions of the wall only came into existence much later and over many centuries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by the experts that the most familiar and best-preserved portions of the wall were built during the Ming dynasty, which is different from the claim's statement about the wall being built 2,000 years ago."}
