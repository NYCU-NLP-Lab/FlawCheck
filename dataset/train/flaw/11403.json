{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the flooding and its impact on the accessibility of Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church. There are pictures and videos circulating online that show no apparent flooding near the church, contradicting the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to definitively prove that the church is \"inaccessible\" due to flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. The pictures and videos mentioned above suggest otherwise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the church's inaccessibility is solely due to flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. However, there could be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the alleged inaccessibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation could be that the church is inaccessible for reasons other than flooding, such as safety concerns or logistical issues. The claim does not provide enough information to rule out these alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and comprehensive picture of the situation. It mentions criticism towards Joel Osteen's church for not making itself available to storm-affected people, but it also mentions relief efforts being organized by the church and its partnership with disaster relief organizations.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the church and its surrounding area. While there are pictures and videos showing no apparent flooding near the church, it does not necessarily mean that the entire region was unaffected by the storm."}
