{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the lie about Donald Trump's election unleashing anti-Semitism by stating it was a \"100 percent lie.\"", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of bomb threats to Jewish community centers by stating that \"hundreds\" occurred, while the evidence suggests that there were at least 245 calls made by one suspect alone.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that \"90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel\" and \"the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend.\" The evidence provided only mentions two suspects who were charged, and it does not provide a breakdown of the remaining bomb threats.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in anti-Semitic incidents after the election, such as the influence of political rhetoric or the rise of far-right ideologies."}
