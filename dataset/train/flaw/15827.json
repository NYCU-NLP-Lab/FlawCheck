{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in stating that \"no one loses coverage\" under the Senate's new health care bill. There is evidence to suggest that coverage for individuals who became eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare may be affected.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that states will continue to cover the expanded Medicaid eligibility category for adults once federal funding starts decreasing. However, there is no guarantee that states will maintain coverage for these individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in explaining how coverage will be maintained for the expanded Medicaid eligibility category under the Senate's plan. More information is needed to determine the specifics of this coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that states may cut eligibility for the expanded Medicaid category once federal funding decreases. This alternative scenario is pointed out by Sara Rosenbaum, a health law professor.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact on coverage for individuals who became eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare. The shift in federal funding and the gradual decrease in support could lead to reduced coverage in the future."}
