{"Contradict fact": "The claim that David Hogg wasn't at school during the Parkland school shooting contradicts the fact that he was present and even filmed a video during the shooting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on misinterpretation of Hogg's statements and fails to consider the evidence of his presence at the school.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hogg couldn't have been at school and also ridden his bike three miles to get his camera, without considering alternative possibilities or clarifications from Hogg himself.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a confusing timeline and not attempting to address the seeming discrepancy in a fair manner.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Hogg's actions and presence at the school during the shooting."}
