Jennifer Beck falters in accuracy when she misspeaks and later clarifies that she meant to say \"workforce\" instead of \"working.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows a decrease in the number of people in New Jersey's labor force and employment levels since the last recession.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having more people working in the state of New Jersey is a positive sign for the economy, without considering other factors such as job quality, wages, and overall economic growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the increase in the number of people working, such as population growth or changes in labor force participation rates, which may not necessarily indicate a thriving economy."}
