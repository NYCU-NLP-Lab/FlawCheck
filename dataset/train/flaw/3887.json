{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Open Society Foundations pays people to protest. The expert's verdict mentions that the flyer shared on social media does not provide any concrete proof, and the phone number mentioned on the flyer was disconnected or no longer in service.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flyer shared on social media is genuine and represents the actions of Open Society Foundations. However, the expert's verdict includes statements from the Thurston County Democrats denying the authenticity of the flyer and the Open Society Foundations stating that they do not pay protesters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements made by Victor Minjares, chairman of the Thurston County Democrats, who stated that the flyer was fake and aimed at discrediting Democrats. The Open Society Foundations also explicitly denied the claim and stated that they do not pay protesters.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the involvement of Open Society Foundations in paying people to protest. The expert's verdict includes statements from the foundations themselves, denying the claim and emphasizing that they do not pay protesters.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting the flyer as evidence of Open Society Foundations paying people to protest, despite the lack of concrete support or authentication. The expert's verdict highlights the discrepancies and contradictions surrounding the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
