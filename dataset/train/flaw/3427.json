{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of Obama administration officials who have never worked outside of government. The expert's verdict mentions that this claim is a \"bad political myth being recycled\" and originated from a study that may not provide an accurate representation of the administration's experience.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. The expert's verdict mentions that this study may not provide a comprehensive analysis of the administration's experience.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having never worked outside of government makes the Obama administration out of touch. The expert's verdict mentions that this claim is part of a \"bad political myth\" and does not provide evidence to support the assumption that government workers are inherently out of touch.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim is a recycled political myth and originated from a study that may not accurately represent the administration's experience. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for the composition of the Obama administration, such as the qualifications and expertise of the appointed officials."}
