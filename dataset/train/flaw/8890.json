{"Contradict fact": "The claim made by Eric Trump that his family \"got out of all international business\" after his father became president contradicts the fact that the Trump children have continued to conduct international business dealings.", "Exaggerate": "Eric Trump's claim exaggerates the extent to which the Trump family has disengaged from international business. They have not completely withdrawn from such activities, as evidenced by their ongoing business dealings.", "Understate": "The claim understates the Trump family's involvement in international business by suggesting they have completely exited such ventures when they have not.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or examples to substantiate the assertion that the Trump family has completely withdrawn from international business.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Trump family's international business dealings are comparable to those of Hunter Biden, which may be a problematic assumption as it overlooks differences in the nature and extent of their respective business activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as it is possible that Eric Trump may be misinformed or unaware of the ongoing international business dealings conducted by his family."}
