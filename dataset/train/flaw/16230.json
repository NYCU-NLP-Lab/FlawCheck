{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the issue by using strong language such as \"infested with maggots\" and stating that the formula had multiple maggots.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the formula was actually infested with maggots. The only evidence provided is a Facebook user's images and testimony.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the presence of maggots, such as contamination in the manufacturing, retail, or home environment. This indicates that the claim may not consider other possible causes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying solely on a single Facebook user's account and images, without any independent verification or investigation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the maggots were present in the formula as a result of a manufacturing or packaging issue, without considering other possibilities.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim understates any aspect of the situation.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim."}
