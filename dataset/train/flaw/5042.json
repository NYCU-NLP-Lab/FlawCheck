{"Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support for Sotomayor's confirmation by only focusing on the 37 percent support and not mentioning the 23 percent who were unsure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one poll (Rasmussen) without considering other polls that show different results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that a solid majority opposes Sotomayor's nomination, as the polling data suggests a tie with a significant percentage of people not having a firm opinion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting the poll results as a clear opposition to Sotomayor's confirmation when it is within the margin of error and can be considered a statistical tie.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Rasmussen poll is the definitive representation of public opinion on Sotomayor's confirmation, without considering other polls that show different results.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a Gallup poll conducted after the Rasmussen poll found that 53 percent favored Sotomayor's nomination, which is not mentioned in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of opposition to Sotomayor's confirmation by only focusing on the 37 percent who oppose it, without considering the 39 percent who support it or the 23 percent who are unsure."}
