{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that people were getting killed and others were willing to risk their lives to save them. While it is true that four Americans were killed in the Benghazi attacks, the claim does not provide evidence of others being killed or individuals specifically willing to risk their lives to save them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that someone told the individuals to stand down. It does not provide specific details or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that someone gave orders for the individuals to stand down without providing concrete evidence or identifying who gave the order. It presents an assumption without sufficient support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the individuals were not able to intervene or provide assistance. It presents a one-sided perspective without exploring other possible factors or constraints that may have influenced the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by the administration, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who stated that there were no military assets available to respond to the Benghazi attacks. The claim suggests that there were individuals armed and ready to go, but it does not align with the official statement.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent timeline of events. It jumps between different timeframes and does not provide a cohesive narrative, which can lead to confusion or inaccuracies in the overall claim."}
