{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the debt ceiling deal on the cost of extending the Bush-era tax cuts. The expert's analysis suggests that the savings from the deal may not cover the full cost, but the claim states that it only pays for half of the cost.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the estimated savings from the debt ceiling deal only cover half of the cost of extending the tax cuts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the debt ceiling deal's estimated savings can be directly compared to the cost of extending the Bush-era tax cuts, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the estimated savings and their relationship to the cost of extending the tax cuts. There may be other factors or calculations involved that are not addressed in the claim."}
