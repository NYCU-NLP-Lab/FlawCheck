{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in sanitary standards between abortion clinics and dental offices by stating that the new regulations will provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or facts to support the assertion that abortion clinics operated at lower sanitary standards than dental offices prior to the new regulations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that abortion clinics should be regulated at least as strictly as dental offices and hospitals without providing a clear rationale or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the new regulations were implemented to either make abortion clinics safer or to put them out of business, as stated by opponents of the regulations."}
