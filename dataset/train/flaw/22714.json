{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the recidivism rate by stating that it is in the \"70 to 80 percent range\" without providing specific data or sources to support this high percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the stated recidivism rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high recidivism rate is a problem solely caused by the prison system's failure to rehabilitate criminals, without considering other factors that may contribute to recidivism.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high recidivism rate, such as socioeconomic factors, lack of support systems, or systemic issues outside of the prison system."}
