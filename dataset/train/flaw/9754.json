{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no definitive evidence provided to show that officials at Ramapo College actually forced students to change the patriotic barbecue event. The emails obtained from campus organizations only show that there was a belief that some offense was taken to the event's theme, but it does not provide any definitive details about a directive from officials.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as there is uncertainty about who made the statement deeming the American theme offensive and why it was made. The Assistant Residence Director, Ariana Rivera, was unsure of who made the statement and mentioned that it might have been administrative, but she was not certain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that officials at Ramapo College forced students to change the event because it was deemed offensive. The college officials themselves stated that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding and their request was regarding the marketing appeal of the event, not the theme itself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as stated by the college officials, that the request from officials was regarding the marketing appeal of the event, rather than forcing students to change the patriotic theme. This alternative explanation challenges the claim made by Campus Reform."}
