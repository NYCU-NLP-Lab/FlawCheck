{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the economic growth rates by stating that the economy has always been growing at rates of 6.3% and above per annum, which is not entirely accurate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the exceptions to the growth rates by only mentioning the years 1986/1987 and 2012/2013, while there were actually more years with growth rates below 6.3%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific sources or evidence to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that economic growth rates have been consistently high since 1986, which is not supported by the available data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fluctuations in economic growth rates, such as external factors or policy changes."}
