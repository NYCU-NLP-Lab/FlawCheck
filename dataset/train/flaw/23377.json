{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the income inequality gap by stating that it is wider than at any time since the 1920s.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by data from the Pew Research Center, it is important to note that the data only compares the years 1928 and 2012. There may be other years in between that could also have had significant income inequality.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the income inequality gap in the 1920s was similar to the current gap, which may not be accurate. It is possible that the factors contributing to income inequality have changed over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the income inequality gap, such as changes in economic policies, globalization, or technological advancements."}
