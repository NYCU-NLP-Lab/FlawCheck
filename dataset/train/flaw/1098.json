{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the retweet by labeling it as a support for white supremacists without providing evidence of King's intent or endorsement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or details about the retweet, such as the content of the post or King's comment on it, which could be seen as lacking enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a retweet by King automatically indicates his agreement or support for the views of the person he retweeted, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the retweet, such as the possibility of an accidental or unknowing retweet, leaving room for alternative explanations."}
