{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that unemployment dropped in every single city and county in Virginia, and in most rural communities, it dropped more than 50 percent. However, the expert's verdict shows that only one rural locality saw its unemployment rate drop by more than half.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it doesn't provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement. The expert's verdict mentions that the data from the Virginia Employment Commission and Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a decrease in unemployment rates, but it doesn't provide detailed information for each city and county.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in unemployment rates during McAuliffe's term was solely due to his actions as governor. However, the expert's verdict mentions that McAuliffe was governor during a prosperous time for the United States, and the national unemployment rate also decreased during that period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the decrease in unemployment rates in Virginia may have been influenced by the overall economic expansion and national trends, rather than solely attributed to McAuliffe's actions as governor."}
