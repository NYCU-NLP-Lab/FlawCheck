{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of one extra year of schooling for girls on reducing infant mortality rates by up to 10 percent. The expert's verdict mentions that the new statement drops the precision of the old claim, indicating that the original claim may have been exaggerated.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any evidence of the claim being understated.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not indicate any instances where the claim falters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the research on the tie between a mother's education and the health of her children looked at child mortality rates, not specifically infant mortality rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may have a problematic assumption that one extra year of schooling for girls directly and significantly reduces infant mortality rates by up to 10 percent. The expert's verdict mentions that the distinction between infant and child mortality rates can have implications for the role of maternal education.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that deaths in infancy and deaths up to the fifth birthday have different causes and factors influencing them. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the relationship between maternal education and infant mortality rates."}
