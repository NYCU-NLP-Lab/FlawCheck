{"Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges and complexities involved in upgrading the Wisconsin unemployment system, as indicated by the estimated time and cost provided by Evers' office and the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to substantiate the assertion that Evers has the necessary authority and revenue to upgrade the system without the Legislature.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that Evers can unilaterally upgrade the unemployment system without any involvement or approval from the Legislature. This assumption is disputed by Republicans, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may ignore alternative explanations or factors that could impact the ability to upgrade the unemployment system, such as potential legal or procedural limitations that require legislative involvement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Evers' attempts to initiate action on the unemployment system through special sessions have been consistently met with quick adjournments by the Republican-controlled Legislature.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Evers' authority and revenue capabilities by assuming that he can complete the upgrade without any legislative approval or involvement, despite the complex nature of the system and the potential need for additional funding.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not fully acknowledging the ongoing political showdown between Evers and the Republican-run Legislature, which has hindered progress on various issues, including the unemployment system upgrade."}
