{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the length of time it takes to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road by stating that it can take 10 years, without providing concrete evidence or specific examples to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that it takes 10 years to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road. The expert's findings indicate that the average permitting process for government infrastructure projects is under five years, with some studies suggesting longer durations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the length of time it took to build the Empire State Building is directly comparable to the current permitting process for road construction. However, there is no evidence or data provided to support this assumption, making it problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided perspective, suggesting that excessive bureaucratic red tape is solely responsible for delaying the construction of federal projects. However, the expert's findings indicate that there are alternative factors and complexities involved in the permitting process, such as environmental reviews and changing regulations, which can contribute to the duration of the process."}
