{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of human trafficking victims in Texas by stating that 25% of all human trafficking victims are located in the state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a fact sheet from the Texas Sex Trafficking Obliteration Project and a report from Children at Risk, but it does not provide additional evidence or elaboration to support the statistic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistic provided by the fact sheet and report is accurate and representative of all human trafficking victims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Texas may have a higher number of human trafficking victims, such as the presence of busy interstate highways, international airports, and a shared border with Mexico."}
