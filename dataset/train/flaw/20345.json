{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Iran has offered an $80M bounty for the head of U.S. President Donald Trump, while the expert's verdict suggests that it was a proposal made by an eulogist during a funeral procession and not an official offer authorized by Iranian authorities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a proposal made by an eulogist during a funeral procession and there is no evidence provided to suggest that it represents the official position of Iranian authorities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposal made by the eulogist represents the official position of Iranian authorities, which is a problematic assumption as it is not yet known to have been authorized by them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the proposal made by the eulogist, such as it being a symbolic statement rather than a literal offer of a bounty.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it was the eulogist who made the announcement, not state TV, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
