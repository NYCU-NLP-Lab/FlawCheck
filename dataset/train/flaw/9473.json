{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the impact of the House Republican health care plan on Medicaid expansion by stating that it \"doesn't get rid of\" it, when in reality, the plan significantly reduces federal funding for the program, making it unsustainable for many states to continue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the House Republican health care plan does not eliminate Medicaid expansion. The expert's analysis and the information provided indicate that the plan's changes to federal funding would effectively undermine and dismantle the expansion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the House Republican health care plan's lack of explicit repeal of Medicaid expansion means that it does not eliminate it. However, the expert's analysis highlights how the reduction in federal funding would make it financially unfeasible for many states to continue the expanded eligibility parameters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that while the House Republican health care plan does not directly repeal Medicaid expansion, its reduction in federal funding effectively achieves the same outcome by making it unsustainable for states to continue the program.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the House Republican health care plan significantly reduces federal funding for Medicaid, which would result in a substantial decrease in Medicaid enrollees compared to projections under current law.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the House Republican health care plan preserves Medicaid expansion by stating that it \"doesn't get rid of\" it, when in reality, the plan's changes would lead to a significant reduction in Medicaid enrollees.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not fully acknowledging the impact of the House Republican health care plan's reduction in federal funding on the sustainability and continuation of Medicaid expansion."}
