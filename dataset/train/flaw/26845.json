{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Hillary Clinton and the abuse of migrant children by stating that she \"gifted\" children to human traffickers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that Clinton was involved in the abuse of migrant children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a Senate report from 2016, which did not mention Clinton's involvement, is new and shocking information that the media ignored.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Senate report and AP investigation found that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was responsible for the neglect and abuse of migrant children, not Clinton.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the abuse of migrant children, such as systemic failures within HHS or the lack of proper oversight and compliance with federal law."}
