{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the war in Iraq on the price of oil by stating that it \"blew the top off\" the price.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the war in Iraq was a major factor in increasing the price of oil.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the war in Iraq and the increase in oil prices, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the price fluctuations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could have influenced the price of oil, such as global demand, supply disruptions, or geopolitical events in other oil-producing regions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that oil prices were already fluctuating before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, as evidenced by the historical spot price data provided in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the relationship between the war in Iraq and oil prices by attributing the entire increase solely to the war, without considering other contributing factors."}
