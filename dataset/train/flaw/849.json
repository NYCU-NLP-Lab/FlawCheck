{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of a change in governors on Foxconn's decision not to build a plant in Pennsylvania. While it is mentioned that Pennsylvania changed governors, it is not clear if this was the sole or primary reason for the project not materializing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to substantiate the connection between Pennsylvania changing governors and Foxconn not building the plant. It relies on statements from Governor Scott Walker and a spokesperson, but there is no further evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Pennsylvania changing governors and Foxconn's decision. It does not consider other factors or potential alternative explanations for why the plant was not built.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or acknowledge alternative explanations for why Foxconn did not build the plant in Pennsylvania. It only focuses on the change in governors as the reason.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the situation and the negotiations between Foxconn and Pennsylvania. It simplifies the issue by attributing the failure to a change in governors, without considering other factors that may have influenced the decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Foxconn has given different explanations for not building the Pennsylvania plant. This suggests that there may be more to the story than just the change in governors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and comprehensive explanation for why Foxconn did not build the plant in Pennsylvania. It presents conflicting statements and lacks a cohesive narrative."}
