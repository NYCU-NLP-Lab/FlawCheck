{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the injuries sustained by the border patrol agent, as confirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photograph shows a U.S. Border Patrol agent injured by a thrown rock in November 2018.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph was taken in 2013, not 2018, and the injury was caused by rock-throwing drug smugglers, not asylum seekers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is related to the specific incident mentioned by President Trump, which has been debunked by official sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photograph, which is that it depicts an injury caused by rock-throwing drug smugglers, not asylum seekers as claimed in the original post."}
