{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been higher-than-normal number of deaths during the pandemic, as supported by multiple analyses and studies.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the interpretation of a flawed analysis to suggest that there have been no excess deaths in the U.S. in 2020 due to COVID-19.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a flawed interpretation of U.S. mortality data and does not consider the multiple analyses and studies that have found higher-than-normal deaths during the pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that there have been no more deaths in 2020 than in prior years, without considering the impact of COVID-19 and other factors on mortality rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for excess deaths during the pandemic, such as unreported COVID-19 deaths and the indirect effects of the virus, as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions."}
