{"Understate": "The claim made by State Rep. Greg Steube understates the number of children who have died in school fires by stating that the number is zero, when in fact there have been multiple documented cases of fatal school fires.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a statement made by State Rep. Greg Steube without providing any specific data or evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because there have been no recent fatal school fires, there is no need for schools to prioritize fire safety drills and training. However, this assumption overlooks the historical incidents of fatal school fires and the importance of preparedness for such emergencies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the focus on school safety training should not be limited to just one type of threat (active shooters), but should also include other potential dangers such as fires.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been documented cases of fatal school fires, as evidenced by the examples provided by the National Fire Protection Association.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as State Rep. Greg Steube himself admitted that he misspoke about school fires and clarified that he was specifically referring to the history of school fires in Florida, not the entire United States.", "Exaggerate": "Although the claim does not necessarily exaggerate the number of children who have died in school fires, it does downplay the significance of such incidents by stating that the number is zero."}
