{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of times the Philippines has won the Miss Universe pageant during President Rodrigo Duterte's term, as it only won once during his term.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that the Philippines won the Miss Universe pageant twice during Duterte's term.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that winning the Miss Universe pageant is directly linked to the president's performance or blessings, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the posts were made to promote the image of President Duterte and describe him as \"beloved\" and blessed, rather than providing accurate information about the Miss Universe pageant."}
