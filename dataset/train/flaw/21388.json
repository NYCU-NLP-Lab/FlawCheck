{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns. The expert's verdict provides examples of other candidates who released fewer than 12 years of tax returns.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that releasing 12 years of tax returns is the standard or norm for major party candidates, which may be a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict provides examples of candidates who released fewer than 12 years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why candidates may choose to release fewer tax returns, such as privacy concerns or legal considerations."}
