{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that Obama's explanation understates the requirements for keeping your health care plan under the Affordable Care Act. Obama's claim that you can keep your plan if it hasn't changed since the law passed is an understatement because there are additional criteria that must be met, such as the plan covering a comprehensive set of benefits and not making significant changes.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict points out that Obama's claim is based on the assumption that people would understand that their plans needed to meet certain criteria in order to be grandfathered in. This assumption is problematic because it may have led people to believe that they could keep their plans without any changes, when in reality, there were specific requirements that had to be met.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Obama made the pledge that people could keep their plans at least 37 times, but it does not provide specific evidence or examples to support this claim. This lack of specific support for the claim suggests that it may not be fully substantiated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Obama's claim, stating that it was not that he said \"if you like your plan, you can keep it,\" but rather \"if your plan hasn't changed since the law passed, you can keep it.\" This alternative explanation suggests that Obama's claim may have been misunderstood or misinterpreted."}
