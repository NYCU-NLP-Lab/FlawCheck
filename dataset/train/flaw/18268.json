{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Democrats do not \"run\" Wisconsin as they control only one of three branches of government.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Wisconsin is \"run by Democrats right now,\" they should address election social distancing concerns, without considering the actions and responsibilities of other political parties.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to establish a direct connection between the political party in power and their responsibility to address election social distancing concerns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as it was the Democratic governor who wanted to stop the in-person election, but Republicans blocked that decision."}
