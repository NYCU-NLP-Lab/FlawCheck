{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that the president has not spent on border security by stating that he is \"sitting on over $1 billion, 94 percent of what we sent him last year for border security he hasn't bothered to spend.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that a significant portion of the funds has been obligated and awarded to contracts.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the status of the funds allocated for border security. It fails to acknowledge that a significant portion has been obligated and awarded to contracts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or context to justify the statement that the president has not bothered to spend the allocated funds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the president's failure to spend a certain amount of money indicates a lack of care or concern for border security. This assumption is problematic as it oversimplifies the complexities of the federal budget process and the execution of funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation and spending of funds for border security. It only focuses on the actual expenditures without acknowledging the obligations and contracts that have been awarded."}
