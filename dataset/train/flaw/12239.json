{"Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of reduction in salaries and health benefits achieved by Kathleen Falk as Dane County executive.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided by Falk's spokeswoman and the director of administration may not be sufficient to fully support the claim of achieving $10 million in reductions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reductions in salaries and health benefits were voluntary and agreed upon by the unions, without providing further evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents Falk's approach of using collective bargaining with unions as a contrast to Walker's legislative approach, suggesting that Falk's method was more effective in achieving savings. However, there may be alternative explanations or factors that contributed to the reductions."}
