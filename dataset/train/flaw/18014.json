{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"Nearly 25 percent of all automobile accidents are caused by texting while driving\" is an exaggeration. The expert's investigation found that the actual percentage of crashes caused by texting while driving in Florida was only 0.1 percent in 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's investigation found that there was no estimate as high as 25 percent for the percentage of crashes caused by texting while driving. The available data showed a much lower percentage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that texting while driving is the primary cause of automobile accidents, but the expert's investigation found that distractions by any electronic communication device comprised only 1.79 percent of crashes in 2012.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation found that distracted driving includes various activities such as talking on the phone, putting on makeup, using a GPS, and adjusting music. Therefore, it is not solely texting while driving that constitutes distracted driving."}
