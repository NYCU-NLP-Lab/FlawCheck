{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the For the People Act of 2021 by stating that it would ensure \"millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the bill does not change the law that prohibits non-citizens from voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the assertion that the bill would result in millions of illegal immigrants being quickly registered to vote.

This assumption is not supported by the evidence provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents one perspective on the purpose and potential effects of the For the People Act of 2021. However, the expert's verdict offers an alternative explanation by highlighting the misleading claims and criticisms made by conservatives regarding the bill.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bill includes measures to ensure individuals registering to vote affirm their citizenship and does not change the law that prohibits non-citizens from voting. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the bill itself to support this contradiction."}
