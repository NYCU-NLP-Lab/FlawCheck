{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decline in Wisconsin wages by stating that they are declining at double the rate of other states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one quarterly report from 2012 to make a broad statement about the decline in wages.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in wages will continue if the current path is maintained, without providing evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in wages, such as economic factors or policy changes."}
