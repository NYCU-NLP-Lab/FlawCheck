The expert's verdict mentions anecdotes and stories from readers, but there is no substantial evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that \"Grade D but edible\" meat is being used by prisons, school cafeterias, Taco Bell, and other fast food restaurants.

Therefore, the claim's assertion that \"Grade D but edible\" meat is being used is contradicted by this factual information.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the use of \"Grade D but edible\" meat by including a wide range of establishments such as prisons, school cafeterias, and Taco Bell. The expert's verdict mentions that the legend has been told in various settings, but there is no concrete evidence provided to support this.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times, as it consistently asserts that \"Grade D but edible\" meat is used by various establishments.
