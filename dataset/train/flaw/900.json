{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that 350 people accepted Islam in New Zealand after the Christchurch mosque shootings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in people accepting Islam in New Zealand is directly related to the mosque shootings, without providing any evidence or alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim includes photos that have been proven to be unrelated to the events in New Zealand, suggesting a contradiction between the claim and the actual facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim states that over 350 people accepted Islam in New Zealand, which could be an exaggeration if there is no evidence to support this number.", "Understate": "It is unclear if any alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the increase in people accepting Islam in New Zealand are being understated or overlooked in the claim."}
