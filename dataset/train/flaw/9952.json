{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the littering issue by stating that beachgoers \"trash\" the beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter, when some of the garbage was found in trash bins.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the issue by referring to the materials as \"litter\" instead of \"garbage,\" which may downplay the severity of the problem.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that beachgoers are solely responsible for the 13,000 pounds of garbage found on the beach.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in litter is solely due to the return of beachgoers, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in garbage, such as inadequate trash bin placement or insufficient beach cleaning efforts."}
