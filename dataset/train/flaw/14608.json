{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the percentage of people seeking asylum who have a valid claim. The expert's verdict states that about 20 to 30 percent of asylum requests have been granted annually since 2009, suggesting that a higher percentage of cases may be valid than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the stated percentage of 80% to 90%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of people seeking asylum do not have a valid claim without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are many reasons why an asylum case might be dismissed or closed, suggesting that the remaining 70 to 80 percent of cases may not necessarily be invalid but could have other factors leading to their outcome.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that a similar statement made by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the percentage of valid asylum claims was rated as false.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a broad percentage range (80% to 90%) without specifying the exact percentage or providing clear criteria for determining the validity of asylum claims."}
