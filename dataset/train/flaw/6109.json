{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the involvement of Kamala Harris and the police in framing and prosecuting the man for a murder he didn't commit. The expert's verdict states that Harris wasn't the prosecutor, and the job fell to one of her deputies.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by suggesting that Kamala Harris paid the key witness $60,000 in relocation benefits for testifying against the man. The expert's verdict does not mention any evidence of Harris personally paying the witness, but rather that the prosecution provided witness protection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Kamala Harris and the police were involved in framing and prosecuting the man.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kamala Harris and the police were involved in framing and prosecuting the man, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the man's arrest and conviction, such as the possibility of a flawed investigation or other factors that may have led to his wrongful conviction.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kamala Harris was not the prosecutor in the case, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
