{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of criminals who go through gun background checks by stating that it is only 3%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that only 3% of criminals go through background checks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that criminals obtaining guns from the street means they did not go through background checks, which may not always be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why criminals obtain guns from the street, such as illegal sales or transfers, rather than solely relying on the lack of background checks."}
