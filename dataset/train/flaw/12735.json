{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were \"tossed out\" of the White House and that Donald Trump is cutting them out of his will. There is no evidence to support these claims.", "Lack enough support": "The story that accompanied the headline neither repeated nor provided evidence to back up the claims made in the headline.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kushner and Ivanka Trump have not been kicked out of the White House. They still hold their positions as advisers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump is cutting Kushner and Ivanka out of his will, but there is no credible source that has reported on the contents of Trump's will.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the downgraded security clearance of Kushner and the tension regarding Ivanka's White House tenure, such as White House Chief of Staff John Kelly's decision to overhaul the security clearance process and Ivanka's attendance at the Olympic closing ceremony in South Korea."}
