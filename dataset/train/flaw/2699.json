{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were deaths in the Parkland school shooting. The expert's verdict states that each of the 17 victims has an obituary online, proving that there were indeed deaths.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"Florida Obituaries show no Parkland school shooting deaths.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that while the obituaries may not show up on a specific website, they do exist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a search on a single obituary website. The expert's verdict provides evidence from multiple sources, including the local newspaper and funeral home websites, to support the existence of obituaries for the victims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of obituaries on one website means that there were no deaths in the Parkland school shooting. This assumption is problematic and false, as the expert's verdict confirms the existence of obituaries for the victims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the absence of obituaries on the specific website it references. The expert's verdict explains that the website in question is known for spreading conspiracy theories and has a history of false stories."}
