{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that Brian May is an astrophysicist. The expert's verdict provides some information about Brian May's interest in astrophysics and his collaboration with the New Horizons team, but it does not explicitly state that he is an astrophysicist.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a lead guitarist for a band and being an astrophysicist are contradictory or unlikely roles. This assumption may not be accurate as individuals can have diverse interests and pursue multiple careers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Brian May's involvement with the New Horizons team and his interest in astrophysics. The expert's verdict mentions his collaboration with the team and his passion for science, but it does not provide a comprehensive explanation for his astrophysical knowledge or qualifications.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Brian May's involvement in astrophysics. While the claim states that he is an astrophysicist, the expert's verdict only mentions his collaboration with the New Horizons team and his passion for science. It does not provide a clear picture of his level of expertise or the extent of his contributions to the field of astrophysics.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts as the expert's verdict confirms Brian May's interest in astrophysics and his collaboration with the New Horizons team. However, it also does not provide enough evidence to fully support the claim that he is an astrophysicist.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide a complete and comprehensive picture of Brian May's involvement in astrophysics. The expert's verdict provides some information about his collaboration with the New Horizons team, but it does not address his qualifications or the extent of his astrophysical knowledge.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Brian May's involvement in astrophysics by stating that he is an astrophysicist without providing sufficient evidence or qualifications to support this claim. The expert's verdict mentions his collaboration with the New Horizons team and his passion for science, but it does not explicitly state that he is an astrophysicist."}
