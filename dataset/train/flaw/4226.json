{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the severity of Wisconsin's infection rate by stating that it is one of the nine states with the highest rate of infection per capita. The expert's verdict mentions that Wisconsin is actually 30th in COVID-19 cases per capita over the entirety of the pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the evidence provided by Governor Evers' staff to support the claim is a New York Times breakdown of cases by state. Although this provides some support, it may not be considered sufficient evidence to conclusively prove that Wisconsin is among the nine worst states in terms of infection rate per capita.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being one of the nine states with the highest rate of infection per capita is indicative of a significant problem. However, the expert's verdict points out that the claim does not provide enough context to determine the significance of this ranking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Evers' claim about Wisconsin's infection rate per capita does not provide enough context. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors that need to be considered to fully understand the situation in Wisconsin."}
