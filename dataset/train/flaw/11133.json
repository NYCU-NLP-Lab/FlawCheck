{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the incident by stating that Hindu women were \"beaten in a bad way\" and \"brutally thrashed.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hindu women were specifically targeted and beaten by Pakistani policemen.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video clip is from an old incident in Pakistan's Punjab, which was revived and communalized in the context of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India. This suggests an alternative explanation for the circulation of the video and raises doubts about the claim."}
