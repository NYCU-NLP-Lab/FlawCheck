{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that postal workers in Michigan backdated ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged directive to backdate ballots, if true, would have an impact on the election results, despite the fact that Michigan law clearly states that late-arriving ballots are not counted.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Michigan law does not allow for the counting of ballots received after the close of polls on Election Day, regardless of the postmark.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences and implications of the alleged election fraud if it were proven to be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the alleged directive, such as misinterpretation or miscommunication, which are not explored in the claim."}
