{"Understate": "The claim \"There has been no net global warming for over a decade now\" understates the consensus among scientists who study the climate, which is that global warming is occurring and humans are contributing to it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that there has been no net global warming for over a decade.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a lack of net global warming over a decade is evidence against the existence of global warming, which is a problematic assumption as climate trends cannot be determined solely based on a 10-year timeframe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the lack of net global warming over a decade, such as natural climate variability or the influence of other factors that may offset the warming trend.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that human activities have contributed to it since 1750."}
