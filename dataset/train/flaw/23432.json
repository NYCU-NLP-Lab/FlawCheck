{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump's proposal for child care go to people making over $100,000 a year. This is because the claim may not accurately represent the findings of the Tax Policy Center study, which is the source cited for this statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that 70 percent of benefits go to people making over $100,000 a year. It relies on the citation of the Tax Policy Center study, but without further information, it is unclear how reliable or accurate this study is.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the distribution of benefits in Trump's child care proposal is unfair or favoring higher-income families. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account the potential reasons behind the distribution, such as the use of tax deductions that are worth more for higher income families due to higher marginal tax rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of benefits in Trump's child care proposal. It focuses solely on the use of tax deductions and the potential impact on higher-income families, without exploring other factors or considerations that may have influenced the design of the proposal.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in presenting a clear and unbiased analysis of Trump's child care proposal. It includes statements from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, which may introduce a bias and influence the interpretation of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential benefits or positive aspects of Trump's child care proposal. It focuses primarily on the distribution of benefits and the potential impact on higher-income families, without providing a comprehensive analysis of the proposal as a whole.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any factual information or evidence."}
