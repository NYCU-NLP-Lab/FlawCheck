{"Understate": "The claim may understate the role of Waffle House closures in FEMA's assessment of natural disasters. The expert's verdict mentions that FEMA informally references a \"Waffle House Index\" but does not formally use it to assess the scope of disasters. However, the claim suggests that FEMA uses the index to determine the severity of natural disasters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that FEMA uses a Waffle House index.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for FEMA's assessment of natural disasters. The expert's verdict mentions that FEMA measures the interruption of multiple large national chains, not just Waffle House, to assess the impact of disasters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by implying that Waffle House closures are the sole or primary factor in determining the severity of natural disasters. The expert's verdict indicates that Waffle House closures are just one aspect considered by FEMA, and other businesses are also measured.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that FEMA does not formally use Waffle House closures to assess the scope of disasters, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the Waffle House Index in FEMA's assessment process. The expert's verdict suggests that it is informally referenced but not a formal or exclusive method used by FEMA.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not fully acknowledging the limitations or shortcomings of using Waffle House closures as an indicator of disaster severity. The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any shortcomings, but it implies that the index may not provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of natural disasters."}
