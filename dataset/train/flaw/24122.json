{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it implies that Ted Cruz supports legalizing all people who are in the country illegally, which is contradicted by his statements and actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ted Cruz has consistently opposed legalization and amnesty for immigrants without legal authorization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a statement made by Marco Rubio during a debate, without providing substantial evidence or examples to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that supporting an increase in H1B visas and green cards automatically means supporting the legalization of all people who are in the country illegally, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation presented in the expert's verdict, suggesting that the debate between Rubio and Cruz revolves around Cruz's proposed amendment to the 2013 bill and whether it was intended to provide legal status or used as a legislative strategy."}
