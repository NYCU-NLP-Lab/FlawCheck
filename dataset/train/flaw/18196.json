{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in its statement that the drug can kill through air and skin contact. While the expert confirms that \"very casual contact\" can potentially cause a serious adverse reaction, it does not explicitly state that it can lead to death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that the drug can kill through the air and skin contact. Although the expert confirms the potential for serious adverse reactions from casual contact, there is no explicit evidence or data provided to support the claim that it can lead to death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drug can kill through air and skin contact without providing concrete evidence or scientific backing. It may be problematic to make such a strong assumption without substantial supporting information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the reported adverse reactions caused by the drug. The claim does not consider other possible factors that could contribute to the severity of the drug's effects, such as individual susceptibility or pre-existing health conditions.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting sensationalized information without providing enough context or evidence to support the severity of the drug's effects. It may be prone to exaggeration or overstatement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or evidence provided by the expert. However, it may lack sufficient evidence to fully support its statement about the drug's lethal potential through air and skin contact.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or downplay the severity of the drug's effects. It presents the drug as particularly dangerous and poses a threat to first responders.", "Biases not present": "None of the biases \"Falters at times,\" \"Contradict fact,\" \"Understate,\" and \"Exist alternative explanation\" are clearly present in the claim."}
