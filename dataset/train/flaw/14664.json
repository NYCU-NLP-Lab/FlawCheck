{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the recent downturn in steel production by stating that \"more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off\" and the steel industry is facing \"billions in losses.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the loss of steel jobs in America is not a recent trend and that over 20,000 steel jobs have been lost since 2007.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off\" and the steel industry is facing \"billions in losses.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the supporting data provided by McCaskill's office only shows a decline in steel mill jobs between January 2015 and May 2016, but it does not provide a comprehensive picture of the overall impact or losses in the steel industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim attributes the layoffs and losses in the steel industry solely to the recent downturn in steel production. However, the expert's verdict mentions that a common reason for job losses in the steel industry is \"steel dumping\" by countries like China, where goods are sold at cheaper rates outside their home market. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the layoffs and losses in the steel industry.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the current state of the steel industry by focusing solely on the recent downturn in steel production and not considering the historical trend of job losses in the industry. The expert's verdict highlights that steel job losses have been occurring since 2007 and that nearly half of the metal-related jobs in America have been eliminated in the past 27 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the recent downturn in steel production and the layoffs and losses in the steel industry. However, the expert's verdict mentions that steel job losses have been a long-standing issue and that the global trade problem, particularly \"steel dumping,\" is believed to be a significant factor contributing to job losses in the industry.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the overall impact of job losses in the steel industry by only focusing on the figure of \"more than 13,600 Americans\" being laid off. The expert's verdict mentions that over 20,000 steel jobs have been lost since 2007, indicating a potentially larger scale of job losses than what is stated in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "No clear contradiction of fact is evident in the provided claim and expert's verdict."}
