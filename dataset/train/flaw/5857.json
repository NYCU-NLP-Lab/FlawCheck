{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Obamacare on the long-term federal deficit by stating that it will increase it by $6.2 trillion without providing enough evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the $6.2 trillion figure, as it is based on articles in conservative publications rather than independent and objective sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $6.2 trillion figure from the GAO report is accurate and applies to the long-term federal deficit without considering the potential impact of cost-controlling elements of the health care law in the future.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the GAO report's findings regarding the impact of Obamacare on the federal budget over the next 75 years, which are not mentioned in the claim."}
