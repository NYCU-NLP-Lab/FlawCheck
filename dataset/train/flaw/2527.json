{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by describing it as a \"genuine video\" and stating that it shows a plane narrowly avoiding an oil tanker upon landing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its authenticity. It is based solely on a video that has been shared on social media platforms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is a real-life event and portrays it as a potential disaster averted by the pilot's skill. However, it is later revealed that the video is from a simulation video game.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the video is not real but rather a clip from a video game. It presents the video as a genuine event without exploring alternative explanations."}
