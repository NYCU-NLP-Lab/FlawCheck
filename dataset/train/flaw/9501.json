{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting facts to substantiate the connection between the Nashville bombing and an AT&T audit into Dominion software.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bombing was specifically intended to stop an AT&T audit and cover up election corruption, without any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the Nashville bombing by linking it to a larger conspiracy involving election corruption and the Dominion software.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to suggest the explosion was election-related and that both AT&T and Dominion have denied the existence of an audit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Law enforcement authorities have suggested an alternative explanation for the bombing, speculating that the perpetrator may have been motivated by paranoia about 5G technology, rather than election-related motives."}
