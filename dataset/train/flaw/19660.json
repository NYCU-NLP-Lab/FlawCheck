{"Lack enough support": "The claim that tax reform plans proposed by House and Senate Republicans would remove the deduction for employee discounts is not supported by enough evidence. The only source that made this claim was a blog post by a law firm, which later confirmed that the claim was based on unclear language in the bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that employee discounts would be affected by the tax reform plans without providing sufficient evidence or clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the most recent version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does not include a provision to remove the current allowance for employee discounts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that employee discounts would not be taxed under the Republican tax plan, as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the provisions of the tax reform plans and creating confusion about the treatment of employee discounts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of the tax reform plans on employee discounts without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
