{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence of a law in Texas that restricts the ownership of more than six dildos. The law in question is related to obscene devices, not specifically dildos.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the existence of a law in Texas that restricts ownership of more than six dildos. The expert's investigation found that the law in question was deemed unconstitutional nearly a decade ago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of a law restricting the ownership of more than six dildos is a sign of training for something awful, which can be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the law in question has been found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which suggests that the law in question is related to obscene devices rather than specifically targeting dildos."}
