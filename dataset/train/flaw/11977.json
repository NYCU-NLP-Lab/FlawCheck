{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the broader context of Trump's comments, which pertained to the loyalty of his followers, was generally absent in news and social media reports. This suggests that there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the comment was part of a larger point Trump was making about the loyalty of his voting base. This suggests that the claim may falter at times by not considering the full context of Trump's statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's statement about shooting someone on Fifth Avenue was meant to be taken literally, without considering the broader context of his comments. This assumption can be problematic as it may misrepresent the intended meaning of his statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Trump's statement, stating that it pertained to the loyalty of his followers rather than an actual desire or intent to shoot someone. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim that are not considered."}
