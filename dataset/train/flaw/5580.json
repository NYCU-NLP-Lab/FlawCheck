{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that federal agencies such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not have data to verify the claim. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that they were doubtful about the existence of an underground culture of selling alcohol in schools. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption that such a culture exists.", "Understate": "The claim states that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol. However, the expert's verdict mentions that only about 1 percent of the surveyed students reported knowing a student who sells alcohol. This suggests that the claim may understate the difference in prevalence between cannabis and alcohol sales.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University did not pose the same question to students in previous surveys and did not publish a 2013 survey. This suggests that there may be some inconsistencies or gaps in the data used to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any alternative explanations for the claim, but the mention of being doubtful about an underground culture of selling alcohol in schools suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the difference in prevalence between cannabis and alcohol sales."}
