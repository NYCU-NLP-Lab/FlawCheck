{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between police training and police killings in the United States and the Nordic countries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the length of police training directly correlates with the number of police killings, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim suggests that the meme accurately compares police training and police killings, but the expert's verdict states that the claim is not fully true.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of police training duration on the rate of police killings by implying a direct causal relationship.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of factors contributing to police killings by focusing solely on the length of police training.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the differences in police killings between the United States and the Nordic countries.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its analysis or presentation of data, as it does not provide comprehensive information or take into account all relevant factors."}
