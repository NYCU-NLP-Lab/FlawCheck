{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to validate the assertion that the video is of Indonesia's Mount Semeru eruption in 2020. The provided evidence includes a Facebook post, a translation, and a report from AFP, but there is no direct evidence linking the video to the mentioned eruption.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is of the mentioned Mount Semeru eruption in 2020 without concrete evidence. It relies on the assumption that the video matches the claimed event, which may be problematic without further verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video where it is identified as a longer version of a video posted on YouTube in 2014, showcasing the eruption of Mount Sinabung in Sumatra. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the video is related to Mount Semeru in 2020.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is actually footage of the eruption of Mount Sinabung in 2014, not Mount Semeru in 2020. The comparison of the misleading post and the YouTube video clearly shows that they are different events.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance of the video by misattributing it to a different volcanic eruption. The video's actual context and historical significance as footage of the Mount Sinabung eruption in 2014 may be downplayed or overlooked.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by incorrectly associating the video with the eruption of Mount Semeru in 2020, leading to a misleading interpretation of the video's content."}
