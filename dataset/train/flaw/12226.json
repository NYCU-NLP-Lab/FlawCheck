{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which global warming will increase the amount of ice in Antarctica.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient scientific evidence or support to back up the assertion that global warming will lead to an increase in ice in Antarctica.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increased temperatures will lead to more moisture in the atmosphere, which will then collect on land in Antarctica and increase ice levels. This assumption may be problematic and not universally accepted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that any ice gains from increased precipitation may be outweighed by melting ice in Antarctica."}
