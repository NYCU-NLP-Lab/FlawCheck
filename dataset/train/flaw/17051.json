{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the incident by stating that a polling booth was captured by Anil Upadhyay. The video clip only shows him accompanying voters, not actually capturing the booth.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove that Anil Upadhyay captured a polling booth. The video clip itself does not provide conclusive evidence of booth capturing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Anil Upadhyay's actions in the video are equivalent to booth capturing, without considering alternative explanations or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video clip is also attributed to other political parties like the BJP and TMC, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the actions shown in the video.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video clip has been shared with different captions attacking both the BJP and Congress, indicating that it may not be directly related to either party.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using sensational language and urging the video to go viral, which may indicate a bias towards spreading a particular narrative rather than presenting objective information."}
