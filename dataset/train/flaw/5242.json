{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Haley Stevens' plan for \"socialized medicine\" by stating that it would eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses. The expert's verdict mentions that the report on which the claim is based makes problematic assumptions to support its analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The report cited by the claim is funded by a group lobbying against Medicare for All, which introduces a potential bias in the analysis. The expert's verdict highlights that the calculation assumes that all other components of Medicare as it is currently implemented for seniors will remain the same under Medicare for All, which may not be the case.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for its assertion that Haley Stevens' health care plan would eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses. The expert's verdict mentions that the report funded by the lobbying group does not specify how many doctors and nurses are included in the figure of 420,000 health care employees that would be affected by a public option.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that experts predict most of the job losses under Medicare for All would be in the health insurance industry, such as insurance brokers and medical billing workers, rather than doctors and nurses. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim's assertion."}
