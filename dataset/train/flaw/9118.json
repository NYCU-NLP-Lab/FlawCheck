{"Lack enough support": "The claim that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes is based on educated estimates and assumptions, rather than concrete data or official counts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that undocumented workers pay more federal income taxes than Donald Trump. However, without knowing the specific details of Trump's tax payments, it is difficult to make a direct comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the use of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) by undocumented immigrants to pay income taxes. However, this does not necessarily mean they are paying more taxes than Donald Trump."}
