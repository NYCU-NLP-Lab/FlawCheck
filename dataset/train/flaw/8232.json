{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Maulana Asad Raza Hussaini was pelting stones in Kanpur lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information. The only evidence provided is a tweet with two images, one of an injured elderly man and another of an old man pelting a stone.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the two images shared in the tweet are of the same person, implying that Maulana Asad Raza Hussaini was involved in stone-pelting. However, Alt News found that the two men in the images are not the same person, as suggested on social media.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the two images shared in the tweet are of different individuals, and there is no evidence to support the claim that Maulana Asad Raza Hussaini was involved in stone-pelting in Kanpur."}
