{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of DUIs on Interstate 35 that are committed by individuals who are in the country illegally. The expert's investigation found no evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately describing the difference between DUIs and DWIs, as well as the consequences for offenders.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 50% of DUIs on Interstate 35 are committed by individuals who are in the country illegally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that individuals pulled over for DWIs are simply given a ticket and sent on their way due to overcrowded jails, which the expert's investigation found to be inaccurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the DUIs on Interstate 35, such as factors other than immigration status that may contribute to drunk driving incidents."}
