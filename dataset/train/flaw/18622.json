{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Iowa's high-school graduation rate by stating that it is the highest in the country, without acknowledging that it falls short in graduation rates among minority populations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic on graduation rates, as the expert suggests that the shift to virtual instruction could shed light on inequities within Iowa.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that Iowa has the highest high-school graduation rate in the country, as it only provides data up until the 2016-17 academic year and does not compare Iowa's rates to all other states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other states may have higher graduation rates that are not reflected in the provided data."}
