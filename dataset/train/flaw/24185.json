{"Understate": "The claim may understate the rarity of cloture motions being filed on Supreme Court nominations, as it is mentioned that cloture motions have only been filed four times since 1949.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the statement that there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current nomination process for Supreme Court justices is the same as previous instances, without acknowledging the rarity of cloture motions being filed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that cloture motions have been filed in the past on Supreme Court nominations, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
