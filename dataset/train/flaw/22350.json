{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it presents the FBI's inquiry into Russian ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government as a criminal case against Paul Manafort being imminent, when in fact it was a preliminary inquiry at the time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a blog post from Occupy Democrats and an unnamed source cited by NBC News. The FBI had not officially announced the inquiry, and the Bureau does not confirm or deny investigations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may have a problematic assumption that the inquiry into Russian ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government would lead to a formal criminal investigation centered on Paul Manafort's stewardship of the campaign and his ties to Ukraine. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation as it does not consider other possible reasons for the FBI's inquiry, such as concerns about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the FBI had not officially announced the inquiry into Russian ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government at the time the claim was made.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting information from multiple sources without providing a clear and consistent narrative. The inclusion of different reports and statements from various dates can create confusion and uncertainty."}
