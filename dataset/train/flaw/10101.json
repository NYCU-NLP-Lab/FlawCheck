{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the COVID-19 vaccine will come with an ID mark that tells everyone you are free of COVID. This is not supported by any evidence or factual basis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ID mark on the vaccine is related to the biblical concept of the \"mark of the beast\" and suggests that it has implications for one's eternal destiny. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or logical reasoning.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the existence of an ID mark on the COVID-19 vaccine.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that COVID-19 stands for \"coronavirus disease 2019\" and not \"Certification of Vaccination ID.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose or existence of any potential identification system related to the COVID-19 vaccine."}
