{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a lack of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the topic of \"blue balls\" and that the understanding of the mechanism is still lacking. This suggests that there may not be enough supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that prolonged sexual arousal in men without ejaculation can cause pain, without providing concrete evidence or scientific backing for this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that the pathophysiology of epididymal hypertension has not been cleared yet, indicating that there may be uncertainties and assumptions surrounding the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are speculative papers and case reports on the topic, but a universally agreed-upon understanding of the mechanism is still lacking. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the pain experienced, indicating that the claim may not be the only explanation for the condition."}
