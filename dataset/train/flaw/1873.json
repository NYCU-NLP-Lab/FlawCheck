{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that 80% of the American people support an approach that includes revenues and cuts, while the poll results indicate that only 70% support the balanced approach when excluding those who favored only tax increases or were unsure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single poll conducted by Gallup, and it is not clear if this poll is representative of the entire American population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for a balanced approach translates to support for including tax increases, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the opposition to including tax increases, such as differing ideological beliefs or concerns about the impact on the economy."}
