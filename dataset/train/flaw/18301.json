{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of contracts awarded to Cobb County businesses by stating it as $250 million, while the research shows it to be around $270 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Cobb County businesses have been awarded contracts worth $250 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the contracts awarded to Cobb County businesses are for the construction of the new Braves stadium, while the research suggests that the $270 million in contracts are not exclusively for stadium construction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the contracts awarded to Cobb County businesses may not be directly handled by the county commission, but rather by the Braves and American Builder 2017."}
