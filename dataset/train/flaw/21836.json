{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Robin Williams used contract riders to perform acts of kindness to homeless people. The information provided suggests that he had a requirement for every event or film he did, but it is unclear how frequently this requirement was actually enforced.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Robin Williams used contract riders to hire homeless people. The information provided is based on a personal account and does not provide any concrete evidence or documentation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the requirement for hiring homeless people was solely Robin Williams' initiative and that production companies and event planners continued the practice after his involvement. However, there is no evidence to support these assumptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the requirement mentioned in the claim. It is possible that the requirement was part of a larger charitable effort or initiative supported by Robin Williams, rather than a personal request made by him."}
