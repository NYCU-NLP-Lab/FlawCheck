{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the number of seats controlled by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the majority of American people voted for a Democratic House.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the popular vote for the House of Representatives directly translates into control of the House, which may not always be the case due to factors such as district boundaries and concentration of votes in certain areas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Republicans control the House, such as the drawing of congressional districts in 2010 and the concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas."}
