{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of Kenyans connected to electricity in the last 50 years. The expert's verdict mentions that 6.9 million people were connected to electricity in the last five years, suggesting that the actual number over 50 years may be higher than 2.3 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that only 2.3 million Kenyans were connected to electricity in 50 years. The expert's verdict does not provide any specific data or sources to support or refute this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of Kenyans connected to electricity in 50 years that are not mentioned in the claim or expert's verdict. These alternative explanations could include factors such as population growth, infrastructure limitations, or government policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that 6.9 million people were connected to electricity in the last five years. This suggests that the claim's statement of only 2.3 million Kenyans being connected to electricity in 50 years may be inaccurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of progress in connecting Kenyans to electricity over 50 years. The expert's verdict mentions the significant increase in the number of people connected to electricity in the last five years, which implies that the progress made in recent years may not align with the claim's statement."}
