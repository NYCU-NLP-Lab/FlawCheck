{"Understate": "The claim understates the extent of Russia's influence on the electoral process by focusing only on vote tallies and not considering other aspects of the campaign that were discussed by the FBI and NSA directors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Trump in his tweet accurately represents the views of the NSA and FBI, despite evidence to the contrary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a brief video clip of the hearing and does not consider the full context of Comey and Rogers' statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Russia's involvement in the election, as Comey and Rogers both stated that Russia sought to influence the election in President Trump's favor.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that both Comey and Rogers confirmed Russia's attempts to influence the election in their favor during the congressional hearing.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by Trump in his tweet by presenting it as the definitive conclusion of the NSA and FBI, when in fact Comey and Rogers did not assess the measurable impact of Russia's actions on the election outcome or public opinion."}
