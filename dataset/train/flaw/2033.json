{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Woolworths supermarket stops buying fruits from Australian supplier SPC is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that SPC confirmed it still supplies fruit products to Woolworths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading Facebook post that does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Woolworths sourcing fruits from overseas and not buying Australian fruits from SPC is a betrayal or against the interest of Australians. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Woolworths' sourcing decisions. The expert's verdict mentions that Woolworths still buys fruit from SPC and has even increased its purchases this year. It also highlights that Woolworths stocks SPC and Ardmona branded products, indicating an ongoing relationship between the two companies.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that Woolworths has completely stopped buying fruits from SPC, while the expert's verdict confirms that SPC still supplies fruit products to Woolworths.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
