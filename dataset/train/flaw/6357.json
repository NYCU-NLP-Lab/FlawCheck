{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Dianne Feinstein \"repeatedly\" ordered the reinstallation of a Confederate battle flag outside City Hall. However, the information provided suggests that the flag was only replaced once in 1981 as part of a larger effort to replace all the flags in the Civic Center.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Dianne Feinstein ordered the reinstallation of the Confederate battle flag. The information provided only mentions the replacement of the flag in 1981, but there is no direct evidence linking Feinstein to this action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Confederate battle flag was flown outside City Hall solely under Feinstein's mayoral tenure. However, the information provided states that the flag had been part of a historic display since 1964, before Feinstein became mayor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents Feinstein as the one responsible for the reinstallation of the Confederate battle flag, but the information provided suggests that the flag was replaced as part of a larger effort by a construction company and was not specifically ordered by Feinstein."}
