{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in THC levels between modern marijuana and marijuana from the 1970s by stating that the levels \"far surpass\" each other.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that marijuana today is genetically modified.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher THC levels automatically make marijuana more dangerous or potent without providing evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in THC levels, such as advancements in cultivation techniques or selective breeding."}
