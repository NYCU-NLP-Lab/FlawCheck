{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of deaths caused by Covid-19 vaccines in the US. The actual number of deaths reported by the CDC is much lower than what is claimed in the post.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that hundreds of people have been killed by Covid-19 vaccines.
