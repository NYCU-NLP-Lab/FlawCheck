{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decrease in spending per student by only mentioning a 3.7% decrease, while adjusted for inflation, the drop is about 11.4%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Virginia spends less per student today than in 2008. It is based on a Senate Finance Committee report, but additional data or sources would strengthen the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in spending per student is solely due to the recession and slow recovery of revenue, without considering other factors that may have influenced the funding decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in spending per student, such as changes in education policies or shifts in funding priorities, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the general funds going to education have not returned to their level of five years ago, suggesting that the claim of spending less per student today is inaccurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the decrease in spending per student, making it susceptible to misinterpretation or oversimplification.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the spending decrease by not considering other sources of funding or potential cost-saving measures implemented during the same period."}
