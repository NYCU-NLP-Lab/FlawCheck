{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Wisconsin voter turnout jumping from 67% in 2016 to 89% in 2020 is exaggerated and not supported by accurate data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misunderstanding of basic election math and does not consider the correct figures for calculating voter turnout.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in voter turnout is a result of voter fraud, which is a problematic assumption without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the increase in voter turnout, such as the impact of same-day voter registration and the overall voter enthusiasm in the 2020 election.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual voter turnout in Wisconsin in 2020 was 72.3%, not 89%."}
