{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of damage to the Lincoln Memorial by stating that it was defaced by Black Lives Matter protesters. The expert's verdict clarifies that the image used in the claim is manipulated and does not accurately represent the actual damage caused during the protests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Lincoln Memorial was defaced by Black Lives Matter protesters. The expert's verdict provides photographs from reliable sources that show the statue was not damaged or graffitied during the protests.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image presented is genuine and accurately depicts the Lincoln Memorial after being defaced. The expert's verdict exposes this assumption as false and highlights the manipulated nature of the image.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the defacement of the Lincoln Memorial as the work of Black Lives Matter protesters, but the expert's verdict mentions that there were instances of monuments and statues being graffitied during the protests. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for any defacement that occurred."}
