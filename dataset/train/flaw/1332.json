{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the amount of federal funding that has been committed to help Florida combat the Zika virus. It states that only $7 million has been committed, but there have been other federal dollars available to the state since the summer.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that \"the federal government has still only committed $7 million\" to help Florida. It does not provide specific sources or data to verify this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $7 million committed by the federal government is the only funding available to Florida for combating the Zika virus. However, it fails to consider other sources of funding or grants that may have been provided to the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the amount of federal funding committed to Florida. It does not explore any potential reasons or factors that may have influenced the funding allocation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Florida applied for and received approval for $15 million in funding through a federal grant program. While only $7.5 million was immediately available, it does not mean that the federal government has only committed $7 million in total.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of federal funding commitment by stating that \"the federal government has still only committed $7 million\" without considering other sources of funding or grants that may have been provided to Florida.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the federal funding situation for Florida. It fails to mention the other federal dollars available to the state and does not provide a complete picture of the funding allocation."}
