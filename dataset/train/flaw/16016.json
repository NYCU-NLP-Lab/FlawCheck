{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates South Africa's ranking in the killing of women internationally by stating that it is \"number one\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim. The expert's verdict mentions that South Africa had the fourth highest rate of women killed in 2016, not the highest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that South Africa is \"number one\" in the killing of women internationally. The expert's verdict mentions that the most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) ranks South Africa ninth in terms of deaths caused by interpersonal violence against women.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that South Africa is the top country in the killing of women internationally without considering other factors or alternative explanations. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is described as \"nonsense\" by a senior researcher, indicating that there might be alternative explanations or factors to consider.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the issue of violence against women in South Africa by focusing solely on the ranking and not providing a comprehensive analysis of the problem. The expert's verdict mentions that South Africa had the fourth highest rate of women killed in 2016, which indicates a significant issue but not necessarily the highest.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear source for the information or responding to requests for clarification. The expert's verdict mentions that Africa Check contacted the minister's office for the source of the information but received no response.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that might contribute to the ranking of South Africa in the killing of women. The expert's verdict mentions that the data from the WHO includes deaths caused by interpersonal violence and that India recorded the highest number of women killed due to interpersonal violence, not South Africa."}
