{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the National Cancer Institute by stating that \"marijuana kills cancer,\" when the institute's webpage does not make such a direct claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to back up its assertion that the National Cancer Institute admits that marijuana kills cancer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the National Cancer Institute's webpage is a report or study, when it is actually a summary of biomedical literature.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the information presented on the National Cancer Institute's webpage, such as the possibility that cannabis may have potential benefits in cancer treatment but is not a definitive cure."}
