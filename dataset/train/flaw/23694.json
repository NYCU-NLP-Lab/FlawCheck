{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in unemployment among Oregon high school graduates aged 18 to 20 by stating that it increased \"more than 200 percent\" from 2008 to 2011, while the U.S. average increased only 30 percent. The expert's verdict mentions that the original claim was revised to reflect a 200 percent increase, indicating an exaggeration in the initial claim.", "Lack enough support": "The original post that made the claim did not provide any links or unemployment numbers to support the statement. This lack of supporting evidence makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Oregon's minimum wage is to blame for the increase in unemployment among high school graduates aged 18 to 20. However, this assumption is not backed up by concrete evidence or analysis.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the original claim made by the Cascade Policy Institute was later corrected to reflect a 219 percent increase in Oregon's 18-20 unemployment rate, rather than the initially stated 300 percent increase. This correction suggests that the claim may have faltered in accurately representing the data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Cascade Policy Institute and the Employment Policies Institute, which provided the numbers for the claim, are both critics of Oregon's minimum wage. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or biases at play in attributing the increase in unemployment solely to the minimum wage, without considering other factors."}
