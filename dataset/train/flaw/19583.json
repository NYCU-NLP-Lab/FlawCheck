{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue of equal pay by stating that the United States is ranked 65th out of 142 nations and territories. This ranking may not accurately reflect the extent of the pay gap between men and women in the United States.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the ranking of the United States as 65th out of 142 nations on equal pay. The source of this information, the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, is not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ranking of the United States on equal pay is a definitive measure of gender-based disparities in wages. However, there may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the ranking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the pay gap, such as differences in professions chosen by men and women or the number of hours worked. These factors can influence the pay gap and may not solely be attributed to wage discrimination by employers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the finding of another study that undermines the assertion made by Hillary Clinton. This suggests that there may be differing perspectives on the issue of equal pay and the extent of the pay gap in the United States.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive or accurate representation of the issue of equal pay in the United States. The complex nature of the pay gap and the various factors influencing it are not fully addressed or acknowledged."}
