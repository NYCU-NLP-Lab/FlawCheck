{"Contradict fact": "The claim that \"black home ownership just hit the highest level it has ever been in the history of our country\" is contradicted by data from the Census Bureau, which shows that there have been 86 quarters since 1994 with higher home ownership rates for black Americans.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the current state of black home ownership by stating it is the highest level ever, when in fact there have been higher rates in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion. The White House did not provide any evidence to back up the claim, and the data from the Census Bureau contradicts it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the audience should applaud and congratulate the president for the supposed achievement of black home ownership reaching its highest level. However, the claim is false, so the assumption is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the president's false claim could be that he was attempting to rally support for Roy Moore in the U.S. Senate election by appealing to black voters."}
