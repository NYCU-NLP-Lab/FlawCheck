{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that 27% of Nigerian women between 15 and 49 are victims of female genital mutilation, while the expert's verdict mentions that the survey found a lower percentage of 18.4% in the latest round.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide a specific source for the statistic mentioned, and the author of the newspaper report did not disclose the document or report that was cited by their contact. This lack of specific support raises questions about the reliability of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported statistic of 27% accurately represents the prevalence of female genital mutilation in Nigeria, without considering potential biases or limitations in the data collection process.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the extent of female genital mutilation in Nigeria if the actual prevalence is higher than the reported 27%. However, this bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported statistic, such as cultural or regional variations within Nigeria that may influence the prevalence of female genital mutilation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that female genital mutilation is illegal in Nigeria since May 2015, as stated in the expert's verdict. This suggests that the practice is not accepted by the law, despite being mentioned as an accepted part of many Nigerian cultures.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions within the claim itself."}
