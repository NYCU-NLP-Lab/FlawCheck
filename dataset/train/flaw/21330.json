{"Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in executions in Iran since Ahmadinejad became president. Amnesty International's tally shows a significant increase from 94 executions in 2005 to 388 executions in 2009.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on Amnesty International's data, which relies on official Iranian sources such as newspapers and provincial judiciary websites. The true number of executions is believed to be higher, but the lack of comprehensive data makes it difficult to determine the exact increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Ahmadinejad's presidency is directly responsible for the increase in executions. While the timing of the increase coincides with his presidency, it is not explicitly stated that he implemented policies leading to the rise in executions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in executions, such as changes in societal factors or legal proceedings in Iran. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and solely attributes the increase to Ahmadinejad's presidency.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that executions in Iran have increased by a significant margin, as reported by Amnesty International. Ahmadinejad's denial of the statistic does not align with the available data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on Ahmadinejad's denial of the statistic without providing substantial evidence to support his statement. The lack of transparency and official government statistics from Iran also adds to the claim's uncertainty."}
