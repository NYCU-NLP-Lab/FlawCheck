{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Kleefisch campaign did not provide a response or evidence for where the $5 billion figure came from. This lack of support suggests that the claim may lack enough evidence to substantiate the tax increase amount.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that something didn't \"smell right\" and that the switch to redirecting to Scott Walker's campaign website gave them a sense of where Kleefisch's claim was heading. This suggests that there may be a problematic assumption or hidden agenda behind the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Legislative Fiscal Bureau stated that the Legislature raised taxes and fees twice in 2009, which suggests that there may be alternative explanations or additional factors to consider when evaluating the claim."}
