However, the expert's verdict suggests that the payment was made in response to a request for documents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the payment made by the UP government, stating that it was in response to a request for fitness certificates and insurance documents. This suggests that there may be other factors at play besides the actions of the Rajasthan government."}
