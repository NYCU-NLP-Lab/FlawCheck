{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the spread and danger of the \"flesh-eating STD\" donovanosis by using sensationalized language and scary-sounding headlines.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that donovanosis is spreading or making a comeback.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the single case of donovanosis in England represents a resurgence or increase in prevalence of the disease, without providing any context or comparison to previous data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of donovanosis, such as the possibility that it is still a very rare disease with isolated cases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that donovanosis ulcers will not spread and damage healthy tissue unless they are left untreated, therefore exaggerating the \"flesh-eating\" aspect of the disease.", "Understate": "The claim understates the rarity of donovanosis by presenting it as a widespread or increasing problem, when in fact it is a very rare disease with only one recently-documented case in the UK.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and reliable information about the nature and spread of donovanosis, as it relies on sensationalized headlines and lacks supporting evidence."}
