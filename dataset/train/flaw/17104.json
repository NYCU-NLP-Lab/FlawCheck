{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of oxygen produced by the Amazon rainforest, stating it produces over 20% of the world's oxygen when scientists estimate it is closer to 6 to 9%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or support to back up the assertion that the Amazon creates over 20% of the world's oxygen.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Amazon's oxygen production is critical for humans to breathe, when in fact, phytoplankton in the sea has played a larger role in oxygen production over millions of years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific estimates and findings that suggest the Amazon rainforest produces a lower percentage of the world's oxygen than stated.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual percentage of oxygen produced by the Amazon rainforest, as scientists estimate it to be around 6 to 9% rather than the claimed 20%.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative sources of oxygen production, such as phytoplankton in the sea, which have contributed significantly to the world's oxygen levels."}
