{"Contradict fact": "The claim inaccurately states that Walmart has stopped selling rifles, when in fact they still sell certain types of rifles.", "Understate": "The claim understates the changes that Walmart has made to its gun-sales policy, implying that they have completely stopped selling rifles when they still sell certain types.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the assertion that Walmart still sells alcohol while stopping the sale of rifles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to stop selling rifles is directly related to the number of deaths caused by rifles, without considering other factors or motivations behind Walmart's decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for why Walmart may have chosen to stop selling rifles, such as public pressure or concerns about gun violence."}
