{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which affluent students are taking advantage of student loan programs and grants, implying that it is a widespread issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that affluent students are disproportionately benefiting from student loan programs and grants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that middle-class families with no connection to college are solely responsible for funding the college educations of affluent individuals, without considering other sources of funding or the complex nature of financial aid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the burden on middle-class families, such as rising tuition costs or other factors that contribute to the need for student loans."}
