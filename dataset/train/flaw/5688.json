{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the frequency of government shutdowns during the speakership of Tip O'Neill by stating that there were 12 shutdowns, when in fact there were 12 shutdowns during his speakership.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that shutdowns are a \"normal part of the constitutional process.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shutdowns under Tip O'Neill and Newt Gingrich can be equated in terms of their nature and reasons, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that shutdowns under Gingrich were not classified as a \"normal part of the constitutional process\" by the expert.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the current shutdown, stating that it occurs when appropriations bills expire and Congress and the president can't agree on new ones. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for shutdowns in general."}
