{"Lack enough support": "The claim that solar and wind energy are \"both cheaper than nuclear right now\" lacks enough support as the evidence provided shows that wind energy is cheaper than nuclear, but solar energy is more expensive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that solar and wind energy are both cheaper than nuclear without considering the specific costs and factors involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cost comparison, such as the inclusion of state or federal incentives, which could affect the relative costs of different energy sources.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not fully acknowledging that solar energy is currently more expensive than nuclear, contradicting the statement that both are cheaper.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the cost difference between solar and nuclear energy by not fully acknowledging the significant price gap between the two.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that solar energy is more expensive than nuclear energy, as supported by the evidence provided.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the affordability of solar and wind energy by stating that they are both cheaper than nuclear, when in reality, only wind energy is cheaper."}
