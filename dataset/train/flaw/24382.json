{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of trash from the United States on ocean pollution by stating that less than 1% of the trash in the ocean is from the United States. This could be an understatement if the actual percentage is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites a Facebook post and does not provide any additional evidence or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by stating that the fact about less than 1% of trash in the ocean being from the United States is an \"inconvenient truth that climate change alarmists leave out.\" This assumes that climate change alarmists intentionally ignore this fact, which may not be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that a portion of the plastic entering the oceans from Chinese soil could be from products originally produced in the U.S. or from plastic waste exported by the U.S. to China. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the presence of trash from the United States in the ocean."}
