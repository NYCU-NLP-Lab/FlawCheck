{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"180 people so far charged with arson during Australian bushfires\" is an exaggeration, as the expert's verdict states that far fewer than 180 people have actually been charged with arson specifically related to the current bushfires.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that police departments across Australia record bushfire-related offenses differently, with some states not releasing any figures at all. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support as there is no comprehensive data available on the number of people charged with arson specifically related to the current bushfires.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 180 people mentioned were charged with arson, but the expert's verdict clarifies that the charges include various offenses relating to setting fires, contravening fire bans, and endangering property.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claim, such as different recording methods by police departments and the lack of available data from certain states."}
