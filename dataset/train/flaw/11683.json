{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate by stating that the director of homeland security \"cannot use and will not use the term 'terrorist attack'\" and instead substitutes it with \"man-made disaster.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the director, Janet Napolitano, has used the term \"terrorism\" in her statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Napolitano's use of the term \"man-made disaster\" is a result of political correctness or reluctance to use accurate terms. However, the expert's verdict suggests that Napolitano's choice of terminology is part of a broader policy to be prepared for all risks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or examples to support the assertion that Napolitano consistently avoids using the term \"terrorist attack\" and substitutes it with \"man-made disaster.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Napolitano's use of \"man-made disaster,\" suggesting that it is part of a policy shift towards being prepared for all risks rather than solely focusing on terrorism."}
