{"Understate": "The claim understates the amount of time it would take for the average GM employee to pay for a year of college tuition, as it would actually take more than two weeks' wages to afford a year at a typical four-year college.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully back up the assertion that the average GM employee could pay for a year of college tuition on just two weeks' wages. The evidence provided only considers the average cost of tuition and wages, without taking into account other expenses or taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average GM employee would be able to allocate their entire two weeks' wages solely towards college tuition, without considering other financial obligations or expenses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in college tuition costs over the past fifty years, such as changes in the economy, inflation, or other factors that are not addressed in the claim."}
