There is evidence that other legislators also voted against it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Dan Patrick's vote against the program means he is out of step and not putting Texas first, without considering his reasons for opposing it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Dan Patrick's vote, such as concerns about expanding the state's bureaucracy or duplicating services already provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."}
