{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Donald Trump's opposition to mandatory sprinklers by only mentioning his lobbying efforts against the measure in 1999. The expert's verdict highlights that Trump later softened his stance and voluntarily invested in sprinklers for one of his buildings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that Donald Trump lobbied against mandatory sprinklers for apartment buildings in New York. The expert's verdict provides some evidence of Trump's opposition but does not provide extensive details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that Trump's opposition to mandatory sprinklers directly caused the lack of sprinklers in Trump Tower. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump Tower does not have sprinklers, but it does not explicitly link this to Trump's lobbying efforts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the lack of sprinklers in Trump Tower, such as potential legal exemptions or other factors beyond Trump's influence. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump challenged the new rule in the 1990s and won, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all possible factors contributing to the absence of sprinklers in Trump Tower.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Trump Tower did not have sprinklers at the time of the fire in 2018. The expert's verdict confirms that Trump Tower did not have sprinklers and highlights the scrutiny it prompted regarding safety measures."}
