{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of Americans murdered with guns each day. The expert's verdict mentions that between 2005 and 2009, an average of 34 Americans were killed by guns each day, but this figure does not include suicides or accidents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support or evidence to back up the statement that 34 Americans are murdered with guns every day. The expert's verdict mentions that this figure is from a period between 2005 and 2009, and it does not include suicides or accidents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of Americans murdered with guns each day will remain constant during President Obama's next term. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account potential changes in gun violence rates or policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of Americans murdered with guns each day, such as the role of mental illness or the legality of obtaining guns. The expert's verdict mentions that most of the killers in mass shootings were mentally ill and obtained their guns legally.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the statistics or context surrounding gun violence. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure of 34 Americans killed by guns each day does not include suicides or accidents, which may affect the overall accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the issue of gun violence by only focusing on the number of Americans murdered with guns, without considering other forms of gun-related deaths, such as suicides or accidents."}
