{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of babies sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect. The expert's verdict mentions that it is estimated to be around 300, but there may be some uncertainty or variation in this number.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim is understating any information or facts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which estimates that about 300 infants are discharged each year with an unrecognized congenital heart defect. However, it is unclear if there are additional studies or sources that provide further support for this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of babies sent home with an unrecognized congenital heart defect is significant enough to warrant mandatory screening tests. This assumption may be seen as problematic if there are other factors to consider, such as the potential risks or costs associated with the screening.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no mention of alternative explanations or factors that could influence the number of babies sent home with unrecognized congenital heart defects. However, it is possible that there could be other factors contributing to this issue that are not mentioned in the provided information."}
