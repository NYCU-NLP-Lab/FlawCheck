{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in the use of one-shots in the governor's proposed budget by stating it as a 500 percent increase, while the actual increase is less than that.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the claim of a 500 percent increase in the use of one-shots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that while there may be a decrease in the overall use of one-shots, there is an increase in the use of a specific type of one-shots called revenue-related initiatives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual increase in the use of one-shots is not 500 percent, as stated, but a lower percentage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the use of one-shots indicates a struggle to keep the budget in balance, without providing evidence or analysis to support this assumption."}
