{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the property tax cut by stating that it was a one-third reduction, when in reality it only lowered a portion of the school tax rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that property taxes were cut by one-third. The evidence provided shows that while the maintenance and operation segment of the school tax was reduced, overall property taxes and school taxes continued to rise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a reduction in one segment of property taxes equates to a one-third cut in property taxes overall, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in school taxes and total property taxes, such as changes in property values or other factors not directly related to the tax cut."}
