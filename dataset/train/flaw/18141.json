{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"Obamacare ... will kill jobs across America\" may be seen as an exaggeration since it presents a broad and severe consequence without providing specific evidence or data to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that projections about the effects of the health care law are speculative and that key parts of the legislation have not even taken effect yet. This suggests that there may not be enough concrete evidence or data to fully support the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that a previous claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, which stated that the health care law was \"job killing,\" was rated False. This suggests that similar claims may have faltered in the past, raising doubts about the accuracy of the current claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert notes that the claim assumes that Obamacare will have a negative impact on jobs without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative explanations for potential job losses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study concluded that some workers may be staying in jobs primarily for health insurance reasons, and once they have other options, they may choose to leave. This alternative explanation suggests that job losses may not solely be attributed to Obamacare."}
