{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no clinical trial to support the claims made about drinking water at specific times having different health benefits. This suggests that the claims lack sufficient scientific evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict states that the claims about drinking water at specific times are \"medical myths\" and that heart diseases are more likely to arise from factors such as cholesterol, sugar, stress, and smoking. This implies that the claims make a problematic assumption about the effectiveness of water intake in preventing heart attacks.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claims made about drinking water at specific times are misleading and not supported by clinical trials or scientific evidence. This indicates that the claims contradict the fact that there is no proven correlation between specific timing of water intake and health benefits.", "Exaggerate": "Although not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, the fact-checking organizations Africa Check and Full Fact have debunked similar claims about timing water intake. This suggests that the claims may exaggerate the health benefits associated with drinking water at specific times.", "Understate": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claims understate any aspect."}
