{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Coca-Cola has bought the rights to Dr Pepper and will be discontinuing production of the latter soft drink. This is not true, as the Dr Pepper brand is owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and there are no plans to discontinue production.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the statement that Coca-Cola has bought the rights to Dr Pepper and will be discontinuing production.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Coca-Cola has acquired the rights to Dr Pepper without any factual basis or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the \"Dublin Dr Pepper\" version of the drink, which was produced with pure cane sugar, is no longer available due to the closure of the Dublin plant in 2012. However, this does not mean that overall Dr Pepper production has ceased or that Coca-Cola has acquired the brand.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Dr Pepper is owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group and has not been acquired by Coca-Cola or any other entity.", "Understate": "There is no understatement bias present in the claim as it makes an exaggerated and false statement rather than downplaying or understating any information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by providing inaccurate information about the acquisition of Dr Pepper by Coca-Cola and the discontinuation of production."}
