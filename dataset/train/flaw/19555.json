{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the impeachment inquiry by stating that Democrats spent $40,000,000 of taxpayers' money, when there is no evidence to support this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the stated cost of $40,000,000 for the impeachment inquiry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the funds spent on the impeachment inquiry were solely used to benefit Democrats and not citizens, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the $40 million figure most likely comes from an inaccurate reporting of the cost of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which is unrelated to the impeachment inquiry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the cost of the investigation, such as forfeitures made by individuals involved in the probe and the fact that the impeachment inquiry solely focuses on Trump's dealings with Ukraine after Mueller's investigation."}
