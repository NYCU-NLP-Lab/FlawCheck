{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the difference in positions between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on the death penalty. While Sanders has consistently opposed the death penalty, Clinton's stance is not clearly stated and her last known position was from 15 years ago.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to clearly establish Hillary Clinton's current stance on the death penalty. The last known position is from 15 years ago, and her campaign did not provide any recent information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Clinton's lack of a clear stance on the death penalty. It is possible that her views have evolved or that she has chosen not to publicly state her current position.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of the candidates' positions on the death penalty. It only provides limited information and does not account for potential changes in their views over time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the two candidates have opposing views on the death penalty based on limited information. It does not consider the possibility that Clinton's stance may have changed or that there may be nuances in their positions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the candidates' positions on the death penalty by presenting a binary opposition between support and opposition. It does not account for potential variations or nuances in their views."}
