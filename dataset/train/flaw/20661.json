{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Justin Trudeau \"takes\" $2 billion from the Canadian retirement fund and gives it to Mumbai. The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is based on a misinterpretation of a statement made by the chief minister of Mumbai's state of Maharashtra, and that the alleged $2 billion in housing is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a three-year-old YouTube video and a 2016 Reuters article, both of which do not provide substantial evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Justin Trudeau took the money from the Canadian retirement fund and gave it to Mumbai without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board) has been investing in India since 2009 and that the alleged $2 billion investment in Mumbai for affordable housing is not true.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the alleged $2 billion investment in Mumbai for affordable housing is not true, as confirmed by the CPPIB's director of media relations.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
