{"Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the information provided by Boulder police is initial and a definitive determination of the weapon used in the shooting is not yet possible until ballistics testing and autopsies have been conducted. This suggests that the claim may falter at times due to the lack of conclusive evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on photographs of Boebert posing with AR-15 style guns and the fact that the suspected assailant in the Boulder shooting owned and used an AR-15 style weapon. However, it also states that definitive determinations on the weapon used in the shooting can only be made after further investigation. This indicates that there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim presents Boebert's actions as rank hypocrisy, implying that she is responsible for the shooting because she posed with AR-15 style guns. However, it also states that the suspected shooter, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, was arrested and charged with the shooting. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the shooting and that Boebert's actions may not be directly linked to it."}
