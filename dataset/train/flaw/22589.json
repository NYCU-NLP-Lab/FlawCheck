{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that a form of strep infection is capable of affecting the nasal cavity and face. The expert's verdict provides general information about invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease (iGAS), but does not directly address the specific claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a specific form of strep infection that can affect the nasal cavity and face, without providing any evidence or clarification. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which only discusses the general nature of iGAS infections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for strep infections, such as mild illnesses like strep throat and impetigo, and more severe and potentially life-threatening infections when the bacteria becomes invasive. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the symptoms described in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no direct contradiction of fact in the expert's verdict. The information provided in the verdict generally supports the possibility of strep infections affecting the nasal cavity and face, but does not specifically confirm or deny the claim.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not appear to understate any information. It provides a comprehensive overview of iGAS infections and their potential severity.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not appear to exaggerate any information. It provides factual information about iGAS infections and their potential consequences.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not appear to falter at any point. It consistently provides information about iGAS infections and their characteristics."}
