{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to verify the accuracy of the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the arrest for not wearing a mask in Delhi is a widespread practice and will soon be followed in other cities/states without providing concrete evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video showing the arrest for not wearing a mask actually took place in Ujjain, not Delhi.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation by suggesting that the arrest for not wearing a mask in Delhi is a common practice, when in reality it was an isolated incident in Ujjain.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the severity or frequency of arrests for not wearing masks in Delhi and other cities.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the extent of the problem by suggesting that arrests for not wearing masks are imminent in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and other states without providing substantial evidence."}
