{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the offer of Aldi giving away a year's worth of free groceries to people who share or comment on its Facebook page.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not appear on the official Aldi USA Facebook page or any of the store's other social media pages, and it is not listed among Aldi's specials on their website.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Aldi is running a giveaway based on a fraudulent post, without verifying the authenticity of the post.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim provides an alternative explanation by stating that the fraudulent post is part of a like-farming scam, where fraudsters aim to generate likes, shares, and comments to scam social media users."}
