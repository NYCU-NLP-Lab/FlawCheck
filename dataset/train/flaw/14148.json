{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the changes made to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' webpage regarding climate change's potential effects on the Great Lakes. The expert's verdict mentions that references to known \"human activities\" contributing to a warming planet, extreme weather events, drought, species and economic losses were also removed, which goes beyond just scrubbing references to the word \"climate\".", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully establish the extent and motivations behind the changes made to the webpage. While the expert's verdict provides some evidence in the form of the original webpage content and the altered version, it does not delve into the specific reasons or intentions behind the alterations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of references to the word \"climate\" on the webpage indicates an intentional effort to downplay or deny the existence of climate change. However, without further evidence or statements from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, it is difficult to definitively conclude the motivations behind the changes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the changes made to the webpage, such as updates in terminology or a desire to present information in a different format. Without more information, it is possible that the alterations were not motivated by a deliberate attempt to scrub references to climate change."}
