{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the tweet by suggesting that it was a warning about the shooting before it happened, when in reality it was post-attack commentary.", "Understate": "The claim understates the timing of the tweet by suggesting that it was posted 11 minutes before the attack, when in fact it was shared almost three hours after the shooting began.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively link the tweet to the shooting or establish an ISIS connection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the tweet being posted before the shooter was named or before it was known that the shooter was a devout Muslim waging jihad is enough proof of an ISIS-inspired shooting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the shooter's motivations and allegiances, which are not adequately addressed in the claim."}
