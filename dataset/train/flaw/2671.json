It lacks sufficient support for this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the regional breakdown of the referendum results is the most important or relevant factor to consider.

The expert's verdict mentions that estimating referendum results by parliamentary constituency is not easy and involves statistical methods. This suggests that there could be alternative factors influencing the voting patterns beyond just regional divisions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual number of people and constituencies that voted to leave or remain is different from what is stated in the claim. The expert's verdict provides more accurate figures based on official results and estimates.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information. It simply presents a simplified statement about the regional voting patterns.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times.
