{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the rarity of presidents getting the chance to put a Supreme Court justice on by using the term \"many\" presidents, when in reality, only four out of 45 presidents have failed to do so.", "Understate": "The claim understates the frequency of presidents nominating Supreme Court justices by implying that it is a rare occurrence, when in fact, more than 90 percent of presidents have sent at least one justice to the court.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"many presidents don't get the chance to put a Supreme Court justice on.\" The evidence provided shows that the majority of presidents have indeed had the opportunity to nominate justices.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that it is uncommon for presidents to nominate Supreme Court justices, when historical data suggests otherwise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that presidents have the opportunity to nominate Supreme Court justices, but they may not always succeed in getting their nominations confirmed by the Senate."}
