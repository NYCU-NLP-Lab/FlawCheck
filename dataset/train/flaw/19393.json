{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in the unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers by stating that it has increased from 10% to 10.3%. The actual increase is only 0.3%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any additional context or data to explain the reasons behind the increase in the unemployment rate or its significance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the unemployment rate is solely due to the actions or policies of President Obama, without considering other factors or external influences that may have contributed to the change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by suggesting that starting the analysis from a different month (February 2009) would result in a different interpretation of the data, showing a decrease in the unemployment rate instead of an increase.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Hispanic unemployment rate actually fell by 0.8% from February 2009 to March 2012, instead of rising by 0.3% as stated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively choosing a specific time frame (January 2009 to March 2012) to support a particular narrative, without considering the broader trends or historical context of the unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers."}
