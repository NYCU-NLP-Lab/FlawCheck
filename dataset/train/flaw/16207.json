{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of Hillary Clinton's proposal by stating that she is \"proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's jobs, including low-income African-Americans.\" The expert's analysis suggests that this interpretation may not accurately represent Clinton's actual proposal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing high-skilled foreign workers to stay in the United States and contribute to the economy would directly result in taking jobs away from low-income African-Americans. The expert's analysis suggests that this assumption may not be supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Clinton's proposal would result in low-income African-Americans losing their jobs. The expert's analysis indicates that the claim's basis is not fully substantiated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides alternative explanations for Clinton's proposal, such as addressing visa backlogs and allowing talented individuals to contribute to the economy. This suggests that there may be alternative motives or reasons behind the proposal, which the claim fails to acknowledge."}
