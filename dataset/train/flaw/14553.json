{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Kavanaugh's children were \"harassed by hecklers\" during the confirmation hearing. The expert's verdict provides evidence that there were disruptions and protests, but it does not mention any specific incidents of harassment towards Kavanaugh's children.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no direct evidence or specific incidents mentioned to support the claim that Kavanaugh's children were harassed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason Kavanaugh's children were escorted from the Senate chambers was due to harassment by hecklers. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there were multiple factors and speculations surrounding their departure, including the protests but also other potential reasons.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for why Kavanaugh's children were escorted from the hearing room, such as the general disruptions and protests rather than specific harassment towards the children.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence or reports of Kavanaugh's children being specifically harassed by hecklers during the confirmation hearing."}
