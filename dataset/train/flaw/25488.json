{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the Mueller investigation is \"soon to be $20,000,000\" is an exaggeration since the actual expenses mentioned in the article are much lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details to substantiate the $20 million cost.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Mueller investigation is a \"Witch Hunt\" and makes references to \"13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats,\" which could be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual cost of the Mueller investigation, as the article mentions that the expenses disclosed only cover the first four and a half months of the probe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cost of the Mueller investigation, such as the complexity and scope of the investigation, which could justify the expenses."}
