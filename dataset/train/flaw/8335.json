{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating by stating that the water sold in informal settlements is the most expensive water in Nairobi County. This statement may not be supported by sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the assertion that water sold in informal settlements is the most expensive in Nairobi County.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that water sold in informal settlements is more expensive than water sold in other areas of Nairobi County, without providing any basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the high cost of water in informal settlements, such as lack of infrastructure or limited access to clean water sources, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned by the expert that nearly half of the water distributed through the Nairobi system is non-revenue water. This suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the high cost of water in Nairobi County, not just its sale in informal settlements.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by focusing solely on the cost of water in informal settlements and not considering other potential problems or challenges related to water distribution and access in Nairobi County.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as there is not enough information provided to make this determination."}
