{"Understate": "The claim may understate the temporary nature of the fence by suggesting that a permanent perimeter fence is planned, when in fact, it is still uncertain whether a permanent fence will be built.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively state that a permanent perimeter fence is planned. While there have been discussions and statements about the need for improvements to Capitol security, no official decision has been made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the temporary security fence will be replaced with a permanent one, without providing concrete evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the decision to build a permanent fence is not yet final and is subject to further discussions and considerations with Congress."}
