{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exaggerates the decline in income under President Obama's tenure. The expert's verdict states that real median personal income under Obama was down about $400 as of 2014, not $3,000 or $4,000 as claimed by McConnell.", "Understate": "The claim understates the improvement in wages since 2014. The expert's verdict mentions that average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation of all private-sector workers increased 2.6 percent since the end of 2014, indicating that workers are better off now than in 2014.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that the average person is worse off by $3,000 or $4,000 a year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in income is solely attributable to President Obama's tenure without considering other factors that could have influenced the economic situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a more up-to-date source of median household income from Sentier Research, which could provide an alternative explanation or perspective on the income decline.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that average household income has fully recovered from the 2007 recession, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making inaccurate statements about the decline in income and not considering the improvement in wages since 2014."}
