{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that \"unemployment now pays $24/hour\" for all unemployed individuals, when in reality it depends on the state's basic unemployment benefits and the temporary boost provided by the federal stimulus bill.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the $600-per-week boost in unemployment benefits is part of a larger $2 trillion stimulus response to the coronavirus outbreak.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assumption that \"essential\" people forced to still work should also receive $24 per hour.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that essential workers should receive the same $24 per hour as unemployed individuals, without considering the different circumstances and purposes of unemployment benefits and essential work.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why essential workers may not receive the same $24 per hour, such as the need to ensure the functioning of essential services during a crisis."}
