{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Steve Adler's law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade. The evidence provided includes statements from Mike Martinez and references to FindLaw.com and the Martindale-Hubble Law Directory, but it does not provide direct evidence or specific details about the nature and extent of the supposed collaboration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that working with Koch Industries, a conglomerate owned by conservative billionaire brothers, would be viewed negatively by the city's preponderance of Democratic voters. This assumption may not be universally true and could be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that Steve Adler's law firm had a professional relationship with Koch Industries, but the nature of the work and the extent of the collaboration are not specified. There could be alternative explanations for this relationship that do not necessarily imply ideological alignment or political support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no mention of Koch Industries on the website of Barron & Adler LLP, where Steve Adler is a co-founding partner. This suggests that the claim may be inaccurate or incomplete.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of Steve Adler's alleged admission of his law firm's work with Koch Industries. The expert's verdict does not provide a clear evaluation of the potential impact or implications of this admission.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict falters at times in providing a comprehensive analysis of the biases in the claim. Some aspects of the claim are not thoroughly examined or addressed, leaving room for ambiguity or uncertainty."}
