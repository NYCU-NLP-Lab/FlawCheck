{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Nancy Pelosi by stating that she announced a \"scheme\" to \"take down Donald Trump in 2020\" by lowering the voting age. The expert's verdict clarifies that Pelosi did not announce any such scheme.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents a misleading headline from a biased source without providing any substantial evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that lowering the voting age is solely aimed at taking down Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The expert's verdict explains that the effort to lower the voting age is not new, not about targeting a specific politician or party, and was not officially supported by Pelosi.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the amendment to lower the voting age did not pass in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation for the effort to lower the voting age, suggesting that it is a scheme by the Democratic Party to take down Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate explanation, stating that the amendment was part of a broader anti-corruption bill and had support from some Democrats but did not pass."}
