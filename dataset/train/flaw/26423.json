{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Paul Ryan is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees, when in fact there were 35 GOP House members who voted yes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) equates to forcing Christian employers to hire LGBT employees, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no House vote on the Kennedy bill and that Ryan wasn't elected to the House until 1998, two years later.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Ryan's vote on ENDA, such as his belief in equal rights or his desire to prevent employment discrimination based on sexual orientation."}
