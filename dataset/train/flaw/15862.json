{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Richard Cordray wants to raise taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform, without providing sufficient evidence or statements from Cordray supporting this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no specific statements or proposals from Cordray indicating his intention to raise taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cordray, as governor, would have the power to raise federal taxes, which is a problematic assumption as governors do not have control over federal tax policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists as Cordray's criticism of the federal tax bill could be based on the distribution of benefits and its impact on the middle class, rather than a desire to raise taxes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by conflating Cordray's opposition to the federal tax bill with a desire to raise taxes, without providing sufficient evidence to support this connection."}
