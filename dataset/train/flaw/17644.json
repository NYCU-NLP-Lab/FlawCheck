{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference between private and public prisons in terms of chasing escaped inmates past the perimeter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that more escaped prisoners will be in communities due to private prisons not chasing inmates past the perimeter.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that private prisons not chasing escaped inmates past the perimeter will directly result in more escaped prisoners in communities, without considering other factors that may contribute to escapes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of escaped prisoners in communities, such as the effectiveness of other security measures or the overall management of the prison system."}
