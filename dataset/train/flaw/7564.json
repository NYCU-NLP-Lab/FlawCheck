{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the travel ban on Somalis by suggesting that it could completely prevent them from receiving relief from famine through coming to the United States.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the travel ban could ban Somalis from receiving famine relief by coming to the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the travel ban would hinder or prevent Somalis from accessing relief efforts in the United States, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts mentioned in the article provide alternative explanations, stating that the travel ban does not affect relief efforts and that the U.S. response to famine is to help people where they are, rather than relocating them to the United States."}
