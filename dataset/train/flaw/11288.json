{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the cost of using E-Verify by only mentioning a cost of $20 per person. It is possible that there are additional costs associated with implementing and maintaining the system that are not mentioned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that using E-Verify is \"a fair amount of cost.\" It is unclear how this cost was determined or what factors contribute to it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of using E-Verify is a significant concern for businesses, without considering potential benefits or long-term cost savings that may result from verifying employees' immigration status.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the cost of using E-Verify, such as the potential cost of hiring and training unauthorized workers, or the cost of potential legal consequences for employing undocumented immigrants.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the E-Verify system can be accessed at no charge, as stated in the expert's verdict. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the cost of using E-Verify."}
