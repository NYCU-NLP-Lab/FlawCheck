{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sources, dates, and information about what constitutes a mass shooting. The map provided in the meme also does not provide any specific details or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the map depicts acts of Islamic terrorism in the United States, but there is no evidence or information provided to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and variability in defining mass shootings. Different sources and experts have different definitions, which can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency in the data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the map, such as it being a representation of mass shootings in the United States rather than acts of Islamic terrorism.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the map used in the meme was taken from an article on mass shootings, not acts of Islamic terrorism.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing sufficient evidence or supporting information to back up its assertion about the map depicting acts of Islamic terrorism.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
