{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the image shows Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden golfing with the CEO of Burisma, when in fact, the individuals in the photo are not the CEO of Burisma.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or proof provided to support the assertion that Joe Biden denied every meeting with the energy company head.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the image proves a direct connection between Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and the CEO of Burisma, without considering alternative explanations or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the individuals in the photo are not the CEO of Burisma, but rather former business partners of Hunter Biden."}
