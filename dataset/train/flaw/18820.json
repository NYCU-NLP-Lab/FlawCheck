{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of money needed to \"shore up\" the pension fund by stating that $500 million needs to be spent for the next 28 years to keep it \"afloat.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the pension fund is currently 86.9% funded, which suggests that the situation may not be as dire as the claim implies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that $500 million needs to be spent to \"shore up\" the pension fund. It is unclear how this figure was determined or what it is based on.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pension fund is at risk of becoming financially unsustainable without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that advocates of public workers argue that it is not realistic to think that all current and future beneficiaries will require retirement benefits at once.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that House Speaker Will Weatherford is proposing an overhaul of the state's retirement system, advocating for a 401(k)-like investment plan as the only option for new public employees. This alternative explanation suggests that there may be other ways to address the financial health of the pension fund without solely relying on a $500 million expenditure."}
