{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster on aquatic life near Alaska, Canada, and Australia by stating that cancer and mutations have been found as a direct result of the disaster. The expert's verdict states that there is little evidence to suggest that fish far from Japan have been affected by the disaster.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the cancer and mutations found in aquatic life near Alaska, Canada, and Australia. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no direct evidence linking the photos of sharks and fish with tumors or lesions to Fukushima.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cancer and mutations found in aquatic life near Alaska, Canada, and Australia are solely caused by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there are alternative explanations and other factors that could contribute to the observed conditions in marine life.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the cancer and mutations found in aquatic life near Alaska, Canada, and Australia. The verdict mentions industrial pollutants or human activities as potential triggers for the cancers, rather than solely attributing them to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is little evidence to support a direct link between the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the observed cancer and mutations in aquatic life far from Japan. The expert's verdict highlights this contradiction by stating that the photos in the post are misleading and not directly linked to Fukushima.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more information. The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any instances of the claim faltering, but it does provide evidence that contradicts the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
