{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Obama administration's Power Plan on energy costs in Texas by stating that costs will rise as much as 16 percent per year, when in fact the increase will occur over a longer period of time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the estimated 16 percent increase in energy costs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Obama administration's Power Plan will directly cause energy costs to rise in Texas without considering other factors such as transmission upgrades, natural gas prices, and retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the timeline of the estimated increase in energy costs, leading to a potential misunderstanding of the actual impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for potential increases in energy costs, such as market fluctuations or other external factors beyond the Power Plan."}
