{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the support for the marriage amendment from Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, and John McCain. The expert's verdict mentions that they all share opposition to same-sex marriage but have different approaches to addressing the issue at the federal level. This suggests that they may have some level of support for a marriage amendment, even if not as strong as Romney's support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or support for the assertion that Rudy, Fred, or John McCain do not support the marriage amendment. It is simply stated as the opinion of Romney. Therefore, it lacks enough support to make a definitive conclusion about their positions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only way to support the marriage amendment is to back a constitutional amendment like the one proposed by Romney. However, there may be alternative ways for Giuliani, Thompson, or McCain to support the amendment without explicitly endorsing a constitutional amendment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the positions of Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, and John McCain. It assumes that their opposition to same-sex marriage automatically means they do not support the marriage amendment, without exploring other possible reasons for their positions."}
