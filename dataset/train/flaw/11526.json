{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Obama has \"ordered the ocean closed.\" While there are restrictions on fishing in a specific area (Florida Bay), this does not mean that the entire ocean has been closed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or facts to back up the statement that Obama has closed the ocean. The evidence provided only mentions restrictions on fishing in a specific area.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the closure of a specific area for fishing is equivalent to closing the entire ocean. This assumption is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the restrictions on fishing in Florida Bay, such as the need for conservation or protection of certain species.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only a specific area (Florida Bay) has been closed for fishing, not the entire ocean."}
