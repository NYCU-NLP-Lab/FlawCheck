{"Exaggerate": "The claim of 100,000 fraudulent votes in Nevada may be seen as an exaggeration since the evidence provided in the expert's verdict does not support such a large number of fraudulent votes.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the evidence provided by the contestants lacked citation to facts, had no quality control, and witnesses had little to no verification of numbers or information about data origin. This indicates a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged fraudulent votes were the reason for the margin of victory in Nevada. However, the expert's verdict states that the district court concluded that there was no evidence to support the claim of any Nevada voter voting twice, suggesting a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the district court found no support for claims that election officials counted ballots from voters who did not meet residency requirements or counted mail ballots from voters who also voted in other states. This suggests the existence of alternative explanations for the alleged fraudulent votes."}
