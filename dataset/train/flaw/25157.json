{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Bloomberg \"cut\" the practice of stop-and-frisk by stating it was reduced by 95%, when in reality there were nearly twice as many stops in his last year as mayor compared to before he took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that stop-and-frisk was overused and then cut back by 95%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting back on stop-and-frisk is directly linked to efforts to stop gun violence, without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of stop-and-frisk actions increased nearly 600% during Bloomberg's first 10 years in office, reaching a peak in 2011.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not acknowledging Bloomberg's defense and continued support of stop-and-frisk throughout his term as mayor, only apologizing and acknowledging its flaws after announcing his candidacy for president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in crime rates, such as other policing strategies or broader societal factors."}
