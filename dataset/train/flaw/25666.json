{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the building over the last two years. The expert mentions that GAAP would rule out \"games,\" \"deceptive accounting practices,\" and \"gimmicks,\" but it is not clear how significant these issues are or how much they have actually affected the state's credit rating and financial obligations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to validate the statement that GAAP accounting has been consistently used in the building for the last two years. The expert does not provide any specific data or documentation to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that using GAAP accounting would automatically eliminate \"games,\" \"deceptive accounting practices,\" and \"gimmicks.\" However, it is possible that these issues could still exist even with the use of GAAP, as no accounting system is foolproof against manipulation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the state's poor national ranking on budget deficits. While the claim attributes it to accounting gimmicks, there could be other factors at play such as economic conditions, spending priorities, or revenue challenges.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the constitutional requirement to balance the state budget can be done mostly on a simple cash basis, rather than the accrual method called for by GAAP. This indicates that GAAP accounting is not a mandatory requirement for balancing the state budget.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of adopting GAAP accounting on the state's credit rating and future financial obligations. While it is mentioned that the state's credit rating is held back by accounting practices, it is not clear how significant of a role GAAP adoption would play in improving it."}
