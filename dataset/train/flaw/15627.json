{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the focus on single-occupancy vehicles by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The expert's verdict mentions that TxDOT has never used the specific term \"single-occupancy vehicle\" and instead provided a statistic about the percentage of Texans who choose to travel by car, truck, or van.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the statement that 97 percent of people are in single-occupancy vehicles. The expert's verdict mentions that the statistic refers to drivers in all of Texas, not just Houston, and it was brought up by TxDOT Commissioner Bruce Bugg without providing specific sources or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that focusing on single-occupancy vehicles is the primary strategy of TxDOT, which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict highlights that Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner disagrees with the strategy of building roads to ease traffic congestion, but it does not provide comprehensive information about TxDOT's overall approach.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for TxDOT's focus on single-occupancy vehicles. The expert's verdict mentions that Mayor Turner emphasizes public transit and other congestion-fighting measures, suggesting an alternative approach to addressing traffic issues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that TxDOT never used the specific term \"single-occupancy vehicle\" according to TxDOT's spokesperson. This contradicts the claim's assertion that TxDOT has been focusing on single-occupancy vehicles.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and specific context for the 97 percent statistic. The expert's verdict mentions that the statistic has been a regular part of Mayor Turner's speeches, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how the statistic is used or its relevance in different contexts.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or facts."}
