{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the Democrats' Green New Deal by stating that it includes \"working towards ending air travel,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the resolution.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or quotes from the Green New Deal resolution itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the elimination of air travel is a goal of the Green New Deal, without providing direct evidence from the resolution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations, such as the mention of high-speed rail as a potential alternative to air travel in the Green New Deal resolution."}
