{"Exaggerate": "Trump exaggerated the amount of money U.S. companies likely have in offshore accounts, nearly doubling a figure the White House includes in a fact sheet.", "Lack enough support": "The $5 trillion figure mentioned by Trump does not have enough support, as experts have stated that they have never seen an estimate as high as $3 trillion and the $5 trillion number seems impossibly high.", "Contradict fact": "The $5 trillion figure contradicts the White House fact sheet, which states that Fortune 500 corporations are holding more than $2.6 trillion in profits offshore.", "Problematic assumption": "Trump assumes that all large U.S. companies with business overseas have offshore accounts to avoid paying U.S. taxes, which may not be true for all companies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains that if a U.S. company brings the money back to the United States, it would be subject to the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus a tax credit equal to whatever taxes the company paid to foreign governments. This suggests that there may be other reasons for companies keeping profits offshore besides tax avoidance."}
