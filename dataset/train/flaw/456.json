{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money coming across the border in drugs. The expert's analysis suggests that the value is actually around $44.2 million per week, which is less than the claimed $53 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the specific amount of $53 million per week. The expert's analysis relies on approximations and data from different sources to estimate the value.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire $53 million is coming across the border in drugs, without considering other possible sources or routes for drug trafficking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the flow of drugs into the country, such as domestic production or other smuggling methods, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the actual amount of drugs coming across the border, as it relies on approximations and estimates rather than concrete data.", "Understate": "The claim may actually be understating the value of drugs coming across the border, as the expert's analysis estimates it to be around $44.2 million per week, which is lower than the claimed $53 million."}
