{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of immigrants who come to the United States based on labor and skill, as the expert's verdict suggests that the figure could be higher than 6.5 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single figure of 6.5 percent without providing additional data or evidence to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people come based on labor and skill is inadequate or undesirable without providing further justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the percentage of immigrants coming based on labor and skill, such as the inclusion of unskilled workers in the employment category."}
