{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that federal spending as a share of the Gross Domestic Product leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009, which is presented as the largest such increase in any eight-year period since World War II. However, the expert's analysis shows that there were larger spikes in federal spending during World War II.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the increase in federal spending during the Democrats' control of Congress and the White House was the largest in any eight-year period since World War II.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in federal spending is solely attributed to the Democrats' control of Congress and the White House, without considering other factors or external circumstances that may have influenced the spending levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in federal spending, such as economic downturns or external events that may have necessitated increased government spending during that period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim implies that Democrats consistently controlled Congress and the White House during the cited years, but the expert's analysis shows that this was not the case. There were periods where Republicans held the presidency and/or control of Congress."}
