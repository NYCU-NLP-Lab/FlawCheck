While the expert's verdict provides historical information about the last Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey, it does not provide additional data or examples to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for why there has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey for almost four decades. The expert's verdict also does not provide any alternative explanations, but it does mention that there have been Republican congresswomen representing New Jersey in recent years."}
