{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of attacks on Planned Parenthood by stating that they come at a time when the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades and 1 in 5 women under 65 don't have access to healthcare. The expert's verdict confirms that the poverty rate among women is indeed the highest in nearly two decades, but it does not provide direct evidence for the claim that attacks on Planned Parenthood are directly linked to this increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct causal relationship between attacks on Planned Parenthood and the increase in the poverty rate among women or the lack of access to healthcare for 1 in 5 women under 65. The expert's verdict acknowledges the increase in the poverty rate but does not provide evidence linking it to attacks on Planned Parenthood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that attacks on Planned Parenthood are the cause of the increase in the poverty rate among women and the lack of access to healthcare for some women. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which focuses on the statistics related to poverty rates and access to healthcare but does not establish a causal relationship with attacks on Planned Parenthood.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the poverty rate among women or the lack of access to healthcare. The expert's verdict focuses on the statistics and does not explore other factors that may contribute to these issues.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the role of abortion in the attacks on Planned Parenthood. The expert's verdict mentions that conservatives frequently target Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions, indicating that abortion is a significant factor in the attacks.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not mention any specific instances where the claim may be inconsistent or contradictory."}
