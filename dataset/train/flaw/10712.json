{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Shaheen's voting record by stating that she has \"voted with the president 99 percent of the time.\" This is because the claim does not take into account the specific context and types of votes that were analyzed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is not backed up by specific evidence or sources initially.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting with the president a high percentage of the time is inherently negative or problematic, without considering the reasons behind those votes or the specific policies being voted on.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Shaheen's voting record, such as party loyalty or alignment with certain policy goals, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Shaheen was ruled \"Mostly False\" in a previous PolitiFact analysis regarding her being the deciding vote for Obamacare.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Shaheen's voting record by reducing it to a single percentage, without considering the nuances and diversity of issues that were voted on.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by relying heavily on repetition and campaign ads rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of Shaheen's voting record."}
