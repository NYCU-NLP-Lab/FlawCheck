{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the constitutional amendment by stating that it \"instructed\" the state board to put $300 million in investment earnings into the fund supporting public school operations. The expert's verdict clarifies that the ballot language did not mention a specific dollar figure and that the amendment presented $300 million as the maximum amount that could be transferred annually.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that the state board, headed by Jerry Patterson, is hoarding investment earnings despite the constitutional amendment. The expert's verdict mentions that the board voted to release $250 million in earnings on investments in 2012 and 2013 for school needs, but there is no information on additional transfers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the constitutional amendment directly instructed the state board to dispatch $300 million in investment earnings to the Available School Fund. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the ballot language and the amendment did not specifically mention a dollar figure, but rather permitted up to $300 million of revenues to be transferred.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the state board may not have approved additional transfers to the school fund. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the details and implications of the constitutional amendment. The expert's verdict provides additional context and clarifications that contradict some aspects of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the constitutional amendment did not specifically instruct the state board to dispatch $300 million in investment earnings to the Available School Fund. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the claim's statement is not entirely accurate.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
