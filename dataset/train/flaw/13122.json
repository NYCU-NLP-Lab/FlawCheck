{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the toxicity of the Dieffenbachia plant by stating that it can kill a child in one minute and an adult in 15 minutes. The expert's verdict states that there have been no reported fatalities related to Dieffenbachia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its assertion that Dieffenbachia is so poisonous it can kill within minutes. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no verifiable information or details provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Dieffenbachia is deadly poisonous and dangerous without providing substantial evidence. The expert's verdict states that the plant's toxicity is limited to causing irritation and swelling, not death.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that the risk of irritation from Dieffenbachia is not news and that the plant's properties as an irritant have been known for centuries. This suggests that the claim may be overlooking the historical context and alternative explanations for the plant's effects."}
