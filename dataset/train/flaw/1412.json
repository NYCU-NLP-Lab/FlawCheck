{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the threat of thieves armed with \"code grabbers\" breaking into cars. The expert's verdict mentions that the earliest remote keyless entry systems were vulnerable to such attacks, but it does not provide evidence or statistics to support the claim that this is a widespread or prevalent issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish the extent or frequency of thieves using \"code grabbers\" to break into cars. The expert's verdict provides anecdotal evidence of a couple of incidents but does not present comprehensive data or research on the prevalence of such attacks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that thieves armed with \"code grabbers\" are the primary or only method used to break into cars. However, the expert's verdict does not rule out other possible methods or alternative explanations for car break-ins.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for car break-ins, such as the police officer's advice to manually lock the car door from inside to prevent theft. This implies that not all car break-ins are solely due to \"code grabbers\" but could involve other factors or techniques.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the effectiveness of modern remote keyless entry systems in preventing theft. The expert's verdict mentions that the earliest systems were vulnerable to attacks, but it does not provide information on the advancements in security measures that have been implemented in newer systems to mitigate such risks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any established facts presented in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not presenting a well-rounded and balanced view of the issue. It focuses on the threat of thieves armed with \"code grabbers\" without considering other factors or countermeasures that may be in place to prevent car break-ins."}
