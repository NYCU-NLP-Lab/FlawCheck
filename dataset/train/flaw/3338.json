{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of heart disease by stating that it causes four times more deaths than murder. The expert's verdict mentions that heart disease is the leading cause of death in South Africa, but it does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim that it causes four times more deaths than murder.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence or data to support the claim that heart disease causes four times more deaths than murder. It only mentions that heart disease is the leading cause of death in South Africa, but there is no further information or statistical analysis provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing the number of deaths caused by heart disease to the number of deaths caused by murder is a meaningful or relevant comparison. However, the expert's verdict does not address this assumption or provide any alternative explanation for why this comparison is valid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanation or perspective on the claim. It simply mentions that heart disease is the leading cause of death in South Africa without exploring other factors or causes of death."}
