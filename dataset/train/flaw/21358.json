{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton in every major metro area except 4 in swing states run by Democrats. This is not entirely accurate, as Biden actually outperformed Clinton in 10 out of the 13 locations analyzed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet from Rasmussen Reports, which pulls a quote from an article in Gateway Pundit, a right-wing media group. The article itself has been corrected, and there is no additional evidence provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the vote counts could not be accurate due to the sheer number of votes Biden received. This assumption is not substantiated and lacks evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden received significantly more votes than Clinton in most major metro areas, as confirmed by USA TODAY's analysis of official 2016 and unofficial 2020 voting data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by mentioning New York, Los Angeles, and Detroit as cities where Biden allegedly underperformed Clinton. However, it is mentioned that two of those states are still counting ballots, and it's too early to determine the final results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as variations in voter turnout, demographic changes, or campaign strategies, which are not explored or considered in the provided information."}
