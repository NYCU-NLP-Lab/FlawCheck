{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the cost of homelessness by stating that it costs about $40,000 a year for a homeless person to be on the streets. The expert's verdict suggests that the cost of homelessness can be reduced through housing-first initiatives, which may indicate that the actual cost could be lower than $40,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the stated cost of $40,000 per year for a homeless person. The expert's verdict mentions a study by University of Pennsylvania researcher Dennis Culhane, but it is not clear if this study directly supports the $40,000 figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of homelessness is solely related to shelters, emergency rooms, and jails. It does not consider other factors or potential costs associated with homelessness, such as social services or mental health treatment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the cost of homelessness. For example, it does not mention the potential impact of systemic issues, lack of affordable housing, or economic factors on homelessness and its associated costs.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately presenting the full picture of the cost of homelessness. The expert's verdict suggests that housing-first initiatives can reduce costs and stabilize the lives of homeless individuals, indicating that the claim may not fully capture the potential solutions and cost-saving measures available.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual cost of homelessness if the $40,000 figure is an underestimate. However, this bias is less clear and may not be as significant as other biases mentioned above."}
