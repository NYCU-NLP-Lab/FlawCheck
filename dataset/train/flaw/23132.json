{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of churches that have closed (500) and the number of new mosques that have opened (423).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the numbers provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of churches and the opening of mosques indicate an \"Islamization\" of London, which is a subjective and problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the closure of churches and the opening of mosques, such as changes in religious demographics or shifts in religious practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that many British mosques are small establishments meeting in converted houses or buildings, rather than large cathedral-like structures.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of purpose-built mosques in Britain, as the estimate is around 200, not just 423 as claimed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its accuracy and reliability by relying on conspiracy blogs and right-wing think tanks that use extremist language and provide cherry-picked data."}
