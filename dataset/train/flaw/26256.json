{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate by stating that Donald Trump \"never said that\" more nations should get nuclear weapons, when in fact he has made statements suggesting that it might not be a bad thing if countries like South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump has made statements indicating that he supports the idea of countries like Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or quotes from Donald Trump to back up the statement that he never said more nations should get nuclear weapons.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump has never made statements supporting the idea of more nations having nuclear weapons, which is contradicted by his statements about Japan and South Korea.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists that Donald Trump's statements about countries like Japan and South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons are not necessarily advocating for more nations to have nuclear weapons, but rather suggesting that these countries should defend themselves against the threat posed by North Korea."}
