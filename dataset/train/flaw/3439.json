{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it inaccurately states that Wendy's replaced workers with machines at thousands of locations due to a minimum wage hike.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that the minimum wage increase directly led to the replacement of workers with machines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the problematic assumption that Wendy's is developing self-serve kiosks for the sole purpose of replacing minimum wage workers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the intent of the kiosks is to shift labor, not eliminate it, and to improve the customer experience.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wendy's added self-serve kiosks at around thirty restaurants in 2016, not thousands of locations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of locations where workers were supposedly replaced with machines by stating \"thousands\" instead of the actual number of around thirty.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
