{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Harry Reid has been trailing in every single one of the 30 published polls in this election cycle. The evidence provided does not support this claim as it only mentions that a Republican led Reid in all but two of the polls reviewed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence about the 30 published polls. It only mentions that there have been polls testing Reid's chances against various possible challengers since at least August 2009, but does not provide a breakdown of the polls or their specific findings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Harry Reid has been trailing in most of the polls. The evidence provided mentions that tea party \"mischief\" and extremism could cost Republicans in hotly contested Senate races, suggesting that the support for Republican candidates might be influenced by factors other than Reid's performance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that trailing in polls is a negative outcome for Harry Reid without considering other factors such as the margin of error, the timing of the polls, or the specific demographics of the polled population. It does not take into account the potential fluctuations in poll results or the possibility that Reid's support could increase closer to the election.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and consistent explanation of the 30 published polls. The evidence mentions different sources of polls and different numbers of polls, making it difficult to determine the exact number and nature of the polls that have been conducted.", "Understate": "The claim understates by not acknowledging the existence of two polls in which Reid was leading, both of which were Democratic polls. This undermines the claim that Reid has been trailing in every single one of the polls.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been two polls in which Reid was leading, as mentioned in the evidence provided. This contradicts the claim that Reid has been trailing in every single one of the 30 published polls."}
