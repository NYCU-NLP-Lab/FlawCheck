{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Arizona's immigration laws on the decrease in spending on welfare, prisons, and education. The expert's verdict mentions that some business owners complained about increased wages, but it does not provide concrete evidence or data to support the claim that spending on these areas has dropped by \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" solely because of the immigration laws.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that spending on welfare, prisons, and education has dropped by \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" due to Arizona's immigration laws. The expert's verdict mentions the departure of undocumented immigrants and the impact on business owners, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to quantify the exact amount of spending reduction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Arizona's immigration laws and the decrease in spending on welfare, prisons, and education. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the undocumented immigrant population was already decreasing due to the 2007 recession and other factors. Therefore, it is problematic to attribute the entire decrease in spending solely to the immigration laws.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that immigrants were leaving Arizona even before the passage of the anti-immigration laws. This alternative explanation suggests that factors other than the immigration laws could have contributed to the decrease in spending on welfare, prisons, and education.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or data to support the assertion that spending on welfare, prisons, and education has dropped by \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" solely due to Arizona's immigration laws. The expert's verdict also mentions the departure of undocumented immigrants and the impact on business owners, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understating bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
