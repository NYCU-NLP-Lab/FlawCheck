{"Lack enough support": "The claim that riding the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster can help dislodge kidney stones is based on a single study conducted by Dr. David Wartinger using a synthetic model, which may not provide enough evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the force of gravity and the motion of the roller coaster can effectively dislodge and facilitate the passage of kidney stones, without considering other factors that may affect the process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the study suggests that roller coaster rides may be a feasible alternative to standard medical treatment in some cases, there may be alternative explanations for patients passing kidney stones after riding the roller coaster, such as natural passage or coincidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that kidney stone blockage often results in severe pain, bleeding, nausea, and vomiting, and implies that riding a roller coaster can alleviate these symptoms, which may not be accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks and complications associated with kidney stones, as it presents a roller coaster ride as a lower-cost alternative to medical treatment without discussing the limitations and potential adverse effects.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting anecdotal evidence from patients and a single study as the basis for the effectiveness of roller coaster rides in dislodging kidney stones, without considering other scientific research or expert opinions.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential benefits of roller coaster rides in facilitating the passage of kidney stones, as it presents it as a viable alternative to standard medical treatment, without acknowledging that larger stones usually require more invasive interventions."}
