{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the state budget is used for state government activities. While the claim states that \"most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things,\" it does not provide a specific percentage or breakdown of how much is allocated to state government activities versus transfers to local communities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that 85 percent of the state budget is transferred to local communities for service delivery. While the claim references a budget overview provided by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, it does not provide specific details or sources for the breakdown of spending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that transferring a large portion of the state budget to local communities for service delivery is a problem or issue that needs to be addressed. However, it does not provide any context or explanation for why this is problematic or whether alternative funding mechanisms would be more effective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide alternative explanations for why a significant portion of the state budget is transferred to local communities for service delivery. It does not explore potential benefits or reasons behind this allocation of funds.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its overall argument or coherence. While it highlights the percentage of the state budget allocated to local communities for service delivery, it does not clearly tie this to the budget cuts proposed by Gov. John Kasich or the criticism from school officials. The connection between the claim and the budget shortfall or cuts is not clearly established."}
