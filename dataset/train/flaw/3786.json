{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the ranking of the Nigerian passport, stating that it is the fifth most powerful in the world, which is not supported by the Henley Passport Index.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a Facebook post by a popular Nigerian entertainer and activist, without providing any additional evidence or sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nigeria remained in 95th place out of 199 passports in the Henley Passport Index.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that countries relaxed their visa requirements for Nigerians based on a CNN news report, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the Nigerian passport's rise in ranking is due to countries relaxing visa requirements after a CNN report, but the Henley Passport Index confirms that there was no change in Nigeria's ranking."}
