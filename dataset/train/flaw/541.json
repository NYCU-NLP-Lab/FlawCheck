{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the 2015 bill signed by President Obama, as it suggests that it directly enabled President Trump's executive order, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the bill did not create an outright ban on entry into the U.S. from designated countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or details to back up the assertion that President Trump's executive order was made possible by the 2015 bill. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information and context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the 2015 bill and President Trump's executive order without providing sufficient evidence or considering other factors that may have influenced the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the countries targeted by President Trump's executive order were first identified as \"countries of concern\" in the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, but it does not explicitly state that this act directly led to the executive order. Therefore, there may be alternative explanations for the selection of these countries in the executive order."}
