{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that mail-in ballot envelopes reveal voter's party affiliation during general elections, which is not true according to voting experts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible source provided to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that mail-in ballot envelopes have bar codes that reveal party affiliation, which is a problematic assumption as there is no basis or evidence for this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the envelopes shown in the video are from a closed primary election in Florida, where party affiliation is used to direct the ballots for counting. This contradicts the claim that the bar codes reveal party affiliation in general elections."}
