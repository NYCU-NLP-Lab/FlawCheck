{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the presence of a codeine tablet in the Gerber Puffs canister. The only evidence provided is the personal account of the Facebook user, which may not be considered reliable or verifiable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the foreign object found in the canister is a codeine tablet without any conclusive evidence. The assumption is based on the opinions of three pharmacists, but their conclusions may not be definitive or universally accepted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of a white pill-like object in the canister. It is possible that the object was not intentionally placed there by Gerber, but rather got mixed up during the manufacturing or packaging process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the canister of Gerber Puffs was sealed twice with intact seals. This suggests that the object could not have been inserted into the canister during the manufacturing or packaging process.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential harm or danger posed by the presence of a codeine tablet in a canister of Gerber Puffs. Codeine is a strong medication that can have serious side effects, especially for young children. The claim does not emphasize the potential risks adequately.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration bias present in the claim. The claim does not appear to be sensationalized or exaggerated beyond the information provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of providing clear and consistent information. The Facebook post is edited in a timeline fashion, and there are updates added later, which may create confusion or inconsistency in the narrative."}
