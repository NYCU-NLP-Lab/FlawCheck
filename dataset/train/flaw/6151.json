{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the tax by stating that Obama put a 10 percent tax on all tanning, when in reality it only applies to indoor tanning services.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Obama intentionally imposed the tax on tanning for the Jersey Shore crew.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain would not have implemented a tax on tanning based on his personal preference for being pale, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the tax on indoor tanning was proposed by Senate Democrats as an alternative to a tax on cosmetic surgery, rather than being solely Obama's idea.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama mentioned Snooki by name and said she would be exempt from the indoor tanning tax, indicating that it was not specifically targeted at her or the Jersey Shore cast.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Obama's mention of Snooki and the exemption for her was made as a joke during a White House Correspondents Association Dinner, rather than a serious policy decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on the statements and opinions of reality TV personalities like Snooki and McCain, rather than presenting objective evidence or expert analysis."}
