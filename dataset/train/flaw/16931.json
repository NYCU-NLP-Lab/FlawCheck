{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Sandy Pasch supported the use of taxpayer dollars for Viagra by stating that she \"voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab for\u2026Viagra.\" It is unclear if Pasch specifically voted on this issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to show a direct connection between Pasch and the use of taxpayer dollars for Viagra. The campaign manager for Alberta Darling did not cite a specific vote or action by Pasch on this issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pasch's support for unions and union rights automatically translates to support for the use of taxpayer dollars for Viagra. However, this connection is not clearly established.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the issue of Viagra coverage in the Milwaukee Public Schools, as it was a long-standing dispute that was ultimately settled in favor of the district. Pasch's role in this issue is not clearly defined."}
