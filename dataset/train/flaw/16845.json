{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Nate McMurray's actions by stating that he \"lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea, too.)\" The evidence provided does not support this extreme claim.", "Lack enough support": "The mailer does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the claim that Nate McMurray lobbied for trade deals that outsourced thousands of U.S. jobs to China and Korea.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nate McMurray's work in Asia, studying law and working as legal counsel, automatically translates to lobbying for trade deals that sent jobs overseas. This assumption is not adequately supported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Nate McMurray's work in Asia, such as promoting American business interests or gaining international experience, which are not considered in the claim."}
