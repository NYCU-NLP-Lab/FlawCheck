{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Rick Kriseman's inaction by stating that he \"just looked away\" when Congemi made racist remarks. The expert's verdict points out that Kriseman can be seen glancing at the crowd and looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst, indicating some level of engagement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Kriseman tolerated bigotry in silence. The expert's verdict mentions that Kriseman's response to Congemi's remarks is not fully addressed in the ad, and it misleads about the specifics of the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that looking away or not immediately responding to a racist statement equates to tolerating bigotry in silence. However, the expert's verdict highlights that Kriseman's actions during Congemi's outburst were not fully shown and may not accurately represent his response to the incident.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kriseman did not completely ignore Congemi's remarks, as he can be seen glancing at the crowd and looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst. The expert's verdict provides evidence that challenges the claim's assertion of Kriseman's inaction.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by selectively presenting information and not fully addressing Kriseman's response to Congemi's remarks. The expert's verdict points out the misleading nature of the ad and its failure to provide a complete picture of the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Kriseman's actions during Congemi's outburst. The expert's verdict suggests that the ad ignores what transpired later and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of Kriseman's response."}
