{"Exaggerate": "The claim of beheadings in the Arizona desert is likely an exaggeration, as the expert states that there have been no deaths due to beheadings or beheadings associated with border crossings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert, Dr. Eric Peters, states that there have been no beheadings associated with deaths in the Arizona desert, and the majority of deaths are due to exposure to the elements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that beheadings are a common occurrence in the Arizona desert, which is not supported by the expert's statement.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for finding skulls or disarticulated heads in the desert, stating that it is a result of decomposition and animal activity, not violent beheadings."}
