{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in mortgage approval rates between white applicants and black or Hispanic applicants. The claim states that white applicants are \"three times more likely\" to get a mortgage, which may be an exaggeration of the actual disparity in denial rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that racial discrimination is the sole or primary factor behind the difference in mortgage approval rates. The expert's analysis reveals that the claim is based on studies released by a real estate website, but it does not provide further details or additional evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in mortgage approval rates between white, black, and Hispanic applicants is solely due to racial discrimination, without considering other factors such as income or credit history. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to mortgage approval decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in mortgage approval rates, such as differences in income, credit history, or other relevant factors that may influence lenders' decisions. By solely attributing the disparity to racial discrimination, the claim overlooks potential alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hillary Clinton misspoke during the town hall event, as acknowledged by her campaign. The expert's analysis reveals that Clinton had used a more accurate version of the statistic in other speeches, indicating that her initial claim was incorrect or inaccurate."}
