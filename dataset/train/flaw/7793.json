{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that USPS will stop accepting items destined to China and Hong Kong, when in reality, USPS has temporarily suspended the guarantee on Priority Mail Express International to these destinations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the temporary suspension of the guarantee on Priority Mail Express International is equivalent to USPS not accepting items destined to China and Hong Kong, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that USPS will completely stop accepting items destined to China and Hong Kong.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the temporary suspension of the guarantee, such as capacity constraints and restrictions due to widespread airline cancellations."}
