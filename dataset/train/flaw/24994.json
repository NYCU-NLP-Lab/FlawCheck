{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that a bottle of hand sanitizer will \"spontaneously combust\" if left in a hot car, which is not supported by official reports.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or official reports to support the idea that hand sanitizer can spontaneously combust in a hot car.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hand sanitizer is prone to spontaneous combustion without providing substantial evidence or scientific backing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the potential fire hazard in a hot car is not specific to hand sanitizer alone but applies to any plastic bottle containing liquid, which can focus sunlight and potentially start a fire."}
