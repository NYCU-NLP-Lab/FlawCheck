{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement on the sign by adding the phrase \"every time he robs a store\" which is not present in the original photograph.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sign is referring to a specific incident involving a man robbing a store, without considering alternative explanations or interpretations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or context to support the assertion that the man in the photograph is referring to a specific incident or making a general statement about fearing for a son's life.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the sign, such as expressing frustration or anger towards police brutality without specifically referring to a robbery incident."}
