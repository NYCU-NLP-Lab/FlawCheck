It does not provide evidence or data to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the debt-to-GDP ratio of about 20% is one of the lowest in the world without providing any comparative data or context, which could be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the 21 million unemployed young men and women, leaving room for other factors or causes to be considered."}
