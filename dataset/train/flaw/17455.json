{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Arnab's video was shot before the attack.

The expert's verdict explains that metadata can be modified and may not accurately reflect the original recording time, contradicting the claim's assertion that the video was shot before the attack.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of faltering bias in the provided claim."}
