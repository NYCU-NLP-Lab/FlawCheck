{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the CDC's admission that Covid-19 doesn't exist based on a misinterpretation of a CDC document.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Covid-19 does exist, as confirmed by a pathology expert and the CDC's development of a viral test for it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a misinterpretation of a CDC document without considering other evidence of Covid-19's existence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of quantified virus isolates in the CDC document means that Covid-19 doesn't exist, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the absence of quantified virus isolates in the CDC document, such as the document referring to the development of the test rather than the initial virus isolation."}
