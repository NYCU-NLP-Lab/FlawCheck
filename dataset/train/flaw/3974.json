{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that \"more people die from\" prescription narcotic painkillers \"than from heroin and cocaine combined.\" It is possible that the claim overstates the number of deaths caused by prescription painkillers compared to heroin and cocaine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a 2011 news release from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that provides figures from 2008. It does not provide more recent data to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in deaths from prescription painkillers, such as the rise in heroin use or the availability of illegally produced fentanyl. It solely attributes the increase to prescription painkiller abuse.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that in 2015, the CDC estimated that heroin and cocaine deaths were more than double the 2008 total, while prescription opioid-involved deaths had risen but not as fast. This contradicts the claim that more people die from prescription painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on outdated figures from 2008 and does not account for more recent data on overdose deaths from prescription painkillers, heroin, and cocaine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the increase in prescription painkiller abuse and the rise in heroin use from Mexico, Central America, and South America. It does not consider other contributing factors or complexities in the opioid crisis."}
