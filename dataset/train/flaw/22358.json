{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential dangers and risks associated with marijuana by stating that there are no documented deaths due to marijuana. The expert's verdict highlights that while marijuana may not directly cause deaths through toxic overdoses, it can indirectly contribute to fatalities by impairing decision-making abilities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that legal prescription drugs statistically kill 100,000 people a year. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim leaves out important context and does not provide any specific sources or studies to back up the statistic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only way a drug can kill someone is through direct overdose deaths. The expert's verdict points out that drugs can also indirectly cause deaths by contributing to accidents or impairing judgment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while marijuana may be safer than other medications in terms of acute health problems, it can still be dangerous by inhibiting someone's ability to make safe decisions. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that marijuana poses no grave risks to a person's health."}
