{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Donald Trump has been disqualified from running for President solely based on his comments about Muslims. This is not supported by any legal statutes or official proclamations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or legal basis provided to support the assertion that Trump has been disqualified from running for President.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's comments about Muslims automatically disqualify him from serving as president, without considering alternative interpretations or legal requirements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the comment made by White House press secretary Josh Earnest, which was cited as the basis for disqualification, could be interpreted as meaning that Trump is not \"morally fit\" to serve as president. This presents an alternative explanation to the claim."}
