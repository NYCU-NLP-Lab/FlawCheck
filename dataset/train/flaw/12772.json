{"Understates": "The claim that \"792,000 Dreamers (88 percent) are over 25 years old\" is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that only about 280,000 (35 percent) of active DACA recipients were over 25 years old.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim that \"900 Dreamers (less than 1 percent) serve in our military\" is supported by the expert's verdict, which states that there were close to 900 Dreamers serving in the military as of September 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim that a social media meme cites accurate statistics to dispute the positive impact of Dreamers on American society lacks sufficient evidence or support to be considered accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the DACA program was rescinded on \"spurious grounds\" of being an abuse of executive power, which may be a biased assumption without providing further evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents alternative explanations by mentioning a vocal minority opposing protections for Dreamers and spreading anti-Dreamer propaganda on social media."}
