{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in the voting populations of Nigeria and India by stating that Nigeria's voting population is six times smaller than India's. This bias is supported by the fact that the expert's verdict provides no evidence or data to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to validate the statement about the voting populations of Nigeria and India. The expert's verdict does not provide any specific information or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the size of the voting population is the sole determinant of the election budget. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Nigeria's 2019 election budget was US$625 million, while India's 2014 poll cost US$600 million. This suggests that there may be other factors influencing the election budget apart from the size of the voting population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions the difference in election budgets between Nigeria and India, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the claim about the voting populations. The claim fails to consider other factors that could impact the election budget and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim."}
