{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Planned Parenthood's actions by stating that they harvested the brain from a living, late-term aborted fetus. The expert's verdict clarifies that the heart of the fetus was briefly restarted before the brain was harvested, and a portion of the video stated that the fetus was already dead when the organ was removed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Planned Parenthood harvested the brain from a living, late-term aborted fetus. The expert's verdict mentions that the video in question is heavily edited, and efforts to obtain an unedited version were unsuccessful. Additionally, the videos are currently part of an ongoing federal lawsuit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Planned Parenthood engaged in the practice of keeping a late-term aborted fetus alive for the purpose of harvesting its brain. The expert's verdict highlights that the videos were produced by a pro-life organization and were heavily edited, raising questions about their credibility and the accuracy of the claims made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that a former technician for a tissue-harvesting company claimed that she was asked to harvest an intact brain from a late-term fetus whose heart was still beating after the abortion. However, it is important to note that this is an individual account and does not necessarily prove the claim made in the initial statement."}
