{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump is \"against minimum wage\" based on statements made by Tim Kaine. However, the expert's verdict states that Trump's stance on wages has been murky and that he has expressed sympathy for minimum wage workers.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the source of Kaine's claim about Trump's opposition to minimum wage is a series of Trump statements. However, the specific statements or evidence supporting Kaine's claim are not provided, suggesting a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump has expressed sympathy for minimum wage workers and has stated that he would like to see a higher minimum wage. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Trump's stance on minimum wage, indicating the existence of alternative explanations.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the answer to whether Trump is \"against minimum wage\" is complicated. This suggests that the claim may understate the complexity of Trump's stance on minimum wage by presenting it as a simple opposition.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, but it also mentions that 45 states have their own minimum wage, with 29 of them setting it at a higher rate than the federal level. This contradicts the claim that Trump is \"against minimum wage\" without considering the variations in minimum wage across states.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim states that Trump is \"against minimum wage,\" the expert's verdict suggests that Trump's stance on wages is more nuanced and uncertain. This suggests that the claim may exaggerate Trump's opposition to minimum wage."}
