{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to validate the existence of a third whale holding up mating whales.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a \"bro\" whale that supports mating whales without providing any credible basis for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that the idea of a third whale holding up mating whales has been mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of whale mating behaviors by simplifying it to the involvement of a single supporting whale.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the behavior observed may be competition between male whales rather than cooperation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of the third whale by presenting it as a necessary factor in preventing the mating whales from floating off, without supporting evidence."}
