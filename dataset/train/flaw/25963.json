{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the Rajputs' protest against the firecracker ban by stating that they celebrated Diwali by firing gunshots in the air. The video evidence suggests that this may not be an accurate representation of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Rajputs protested against the firecracker ban by firing gunshots. The provided video evidence and information suggest that the video is unrelated to the firecracker ban protest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of a tradition followed during Holi in Menar village is being misrepresented as Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban on Diwali. This assumption may not be fully supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it represents a 400-year-old tradition known as 'Barood Ki Holi' where gunshots are fired in the air. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that it represents Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was uploaded in September 2020, while Diwali was celebrated on November 14, 2020. This contradiction suggests that the video cannot accurately represent Rajputs protesting against the firecracker ban on Diwali.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
