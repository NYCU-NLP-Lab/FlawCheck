{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of times the individual voted, stating that she voted multiple times for Hillary Clinton, when in fact she only voted once in each election.", "Understate": "The claim understates the legal status of the individual, referring to her as an \"illegal immigrant\" when she is actually a permanent U.S. resident.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to link the individual's illegal voting with Hillary Clinton. The expert's verdict states that the case against the individual does not involve the 2016 election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individual's illegal voting is representative of a larger issue of illegal voting by undocumented immigrants, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the individual's illegal voting, such as confusion with voter registration forms."}
