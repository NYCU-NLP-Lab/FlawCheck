{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of H.R. 1 by stating that it would force states to restore voting rights for convicted felons, including violent felons convicted of murder or rape. The bill actually restores voting rights for people convicted of a crime only once they are out of jail or prison.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing the complete information about H.R. 1, specifically omitting the fact that voting rights are only restored after individuals are out of prison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that H.R. 1 would force states to restore voting rights for convicted felons, including violent felons convicted of murder or rape. The bill itself does not expressly mention murderers or rapists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that H.R. 1 would allow murderers and rapists to vote. While the bill restores voting rights for people convicted of a crime, it does not specifically target murderers or rapists.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the bill does not explicitly mention murderers or rapists and only restores voting rights for individuals once they are out of prison."}
