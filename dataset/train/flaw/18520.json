{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Paul Ryan's attempt to \"change the whole game\" for Social Security. While Ryan did propose reforms to the program, it is an exaggeration to say that he tried to completely overhaul it.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Paul Ryan's proposed changes to Social Security. While the claim acknowledges that Ryan proposed reforms, it does not provide enough information to determine the full extent of those changes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully evaluate the accuracy of the statement. It mentions Ryan's proposed legislation but does not provide further evidence or analysis to determine if he truly tried to \"change the whole game\" for Social Security.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ryan's proposed changes to Social Security would have significantly altered the program. However, without further information or analysis, it is unclear if this assumption is valid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Ryan's proposed reforms to Social Security. It does not explore other possible motivations or goals behind his proposals."}
