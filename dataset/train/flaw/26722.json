{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the Delhi police breaking CCTV cameras during the farmers' protest. The provided evidence only includes a few social media posts and videos, and there is no comprehensive data or investigation to support the claim that the police systematically destroyed CCTV cameras.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Delhi police broke CCTV cameras during the farmers' protest. The evidence provided includes social media posts and videos, but there is no independent verification or official reports confirming the extent of the destruction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video of Delhi police breaking CCTV cameras. The article mentions that the cameras seen in the video were installed by the Khureji protesters (anti-CAA), suggesting that the destruction of cameras may have been carried out by protesters rather than the police.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and conclusive link between the Delhi police and the destruction of CCTV cameras. The evidence provided includes social media posts, videos, and anonymous testimonies, but there is no direct evidence or official statement from the Delhi police confirming their involvement in breaking the cameras.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of Delhi police breaking CCTV cameras is directly related to the farmers' protest. However, the article mentions that the video is from a previous incident during the February 2020 communal violence in Delhi. Therefore, assuming a direct connection between the video and the farmers' protest may be problematic.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim."}
