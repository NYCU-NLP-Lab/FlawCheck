{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Hillary Clinton engaged with local press during the first three months of her campaign. The expert's analysis suggests that Clinton did provide interviews and media availabilities with local news outlets in various states, but it is not clear if these interactions were consistent or extensive.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the assertion that Clinton did local press all along in the last three months. The expert's analysis relies on limited documentation and pool reports, which may not provide a comprehensive picture of Clinton's media engagements during that period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that doing local press interviews is an accurate measure of Clinton's media accessibility and engagement. However, the expert's analysis points out that the definition of \"doing local press\" can vary, and it may not encompass all forms of media interactions or the level of scrutiny faced by national media interviews.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's limited engagement with national media during the first phase of her campaign. The expert's analysis highlights Clinton's focus on connecting with average Americans and her desire to have time for personal interactions, which may explain her strategy rather than a deliberate avoidance of national media interviews.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Clinton did participate in national media interviews, as evidenced by her interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar. While Clinton asserts that nothing has changed in her media strategy, her engagement with national media during this specific interview contradicts that statement.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and consistent explanation of Clinton's media strategy. The expert's analysis includes various perspectives and sources, making it challenging to determine a definitive stance on the biases present in the claim."}
