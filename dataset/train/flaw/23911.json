{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video shows a funeral procession for militants, not a protest against the Indian government's decision on Article 370.", "Understate": "The claim understates the situation by falsely depicting the video as a protest when it is actually a funeral procession.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading video and does not provide any additional evidence to support the assertion of Kashmiris protesting against the Indian government's decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video shows a funeral procession for militants, which is a completely different context than the claim suggests."}
