{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of permits and fees required for the small business to expand by stating that they needed \"31 different permits and fees.\" The actual number provided by the owner of the business is 32 permits and 26 tax and insurance requirements, which does not match the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to verify the accuracy of the statement. It relies on anecdotal evidence from the owner of the business without providing any additional data or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of permits and fees required for the small business to expand is excessive and indicative of a government that is \"out of control.\" However, it does not provide any context or comparison to similar businesses in other districts or states, making it a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the perspective of the small business owner who believes that complying with regulations requires more work and money than necessary. However, it does not explore alternative explanations or perspectives from government officials or experts in the field."}
