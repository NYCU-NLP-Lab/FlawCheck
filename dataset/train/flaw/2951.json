{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of new women entering the workforce on Trump's watch by stating that \"over a half a million new women entered the workforce.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that 863,000 women joined the workforce during Trump's first 11 months in office, which is 34 percent less than the previous two years.", "Understate": "The claim understates the historical context and significance of the increase in women employees. The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in women employees during Trump's presidency is the smallest since 2012 and below the historical norm for the past 54 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the increase in women employees is a sign of economic progress. The expert's verdict points out that the increase is below historical norms and that the decrease in the women's unemployment rate has been a trend for several years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in women employees, such as broader economic trends or policies that may have influenced the job market. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations, but it suggests that the claim is misleading and lacks context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in women employees during Trump's presidency is lower than the previous two years. The expert's verdict provides data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to support this contradiction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in women employees is solely due to Trump's policies or actions. The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention this assumption, but it highlights the misleading nature of the claim and provides historical context to suggest that other factors may be at play.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the increase in women employees as a significant achievement of the Trump administration without acknowledging the historical context or the limitations of the increase. The expert's verdict points out the misleading nature of the claim and provides additional information to put it into context."}
