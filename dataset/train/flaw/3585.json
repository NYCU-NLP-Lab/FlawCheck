{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Metro Manila and Laguna would remain under GCQ until at least the end of June, not ECQ as stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or reliable sources to back up the assertion that Metro Manila is being put back on strict lockdown restrictions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the motion to put Metro Manila back on strict lockdown restrictions has been passed by the Philippine government, but this is not supported by the available evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Metro Manila and Laguna are under GCQ, not ECQ, as stated by the government announcement."}
