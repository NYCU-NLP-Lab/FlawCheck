{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the complexity and ingenuity of the carjacking scheme, suggesting that carjackers have invented a novel criminal plot involving the theft of license plates and luring victims into carjackings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the existence of this new trend in carjacking. The expert points out the lack of explanation for why a robber would engage in such time-consuming and risky actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that motorists would not notice the lack of license plates on their vehicles, which is a problematic assumption as it seems logical that most people would observe this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there are alternative explanations for the actions described in the claim, such as a standard carjacking scenario being a crime of opportunity rather than involving a complex scheme with stolen license plates.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim by highlighting the lack of benefit to the criminal actor in the proposed scheme and the potential for greater risk of getting caught.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its logic and reasoning, as pointed out by the expert in questioning the motives and actions of the supposed carjackers.", "Understate": "There is no clear instance of understatement in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
