{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Energy Transfer Partners continued to build the Dakota Access Pipeline despite the decision to halt construction. The expert's verdict mentions that rumors claimed the pipeline was \"still under active construction,\" but no specifics or evidence were provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or details about how Energy Transfer Partners continued construction or accepted a $50,000 daily fine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Energy Transfer Partners continued to build the pipeline and accepted a daily fine without providing any evidence or explanation for how this would occur. It is unclear if such actions were actually taken by the company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rumors or statements made by Energy Transfer Partners. The expert's verdict mentions that the company released a statement calling the denial of the easement a \"purely political action\" and accusing the Obama administration of intentionally delaying a decision. This alternative explanation is not addressed in the claim."}
