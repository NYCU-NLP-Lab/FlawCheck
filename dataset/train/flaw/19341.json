{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence of a physical wall between Jordan and Syria. There is no end-to-end physical wall across the Jordan-Syria border.", "Understate": "The claim understates the nature of the barriers that do exist along the border. They are described as a series of barriers largely funded by the United States, but the claim fails to fully acknowledge their presence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the United States paid for the barriers. It only mentions that the barriers were approved with bipartisan support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the barriers were solely built to keep ISIS out, without considering other potential reasons for their construction, such as blocking refugees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the barriers, such as their purpose in blocking refugees and addressing regional instability.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no physical wall along the entire Jordan-Syria border, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading comparison between the US building a wall in Jordan and the debate over a wall on the US-Mexico border."}
