{"Understate": "The claim may understate the seriousness of the threat posed by individuals carrying zip cuffs at the U.S. Capitol insurrection. The expert mentions that investigations showed growing evidence that some of the people carrying zip cuffs intended to kidnap and \"take hostages,\" suggesting a more severe intention than implied by Shapiro's tweet.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by downplaying the purpose of the zip ties in the attack on the Capitol. The expert notes that Shapiro appeared to downplay the seriousness of the threat posed by people with zip ties, which can be seen as a flaw in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully address the purpose and intentions of individuals carrying zip cuffs at the U.S. Capitol insurrection. While the expert mentions ongoing investigations suggesting nefarious intentions, it is not explicitly stated whether all individuals carrying zip cuffs had such intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not fully consider alternative explanations for individuals owning zip ties. While Shapiro's tweet implies that it is common for \"regular humans\" to own zip ties, it does not explore other possible reasons for owning them, such as household use or hobbies."}
