{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which per-student funding has dropped by only mentioning a $4,000 decrease without providing additional context or comparison to previous funding levels.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"savage cuts to education expose a lack of vision for Florida's future.\" More information is needed to establish a direct link between funding cuts and the lack of vision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in per-student funding is solely due to cuts from general revenue, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations for the decrease.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in per-student funding, such as changes in tuition rates or shifts in funding sources, which are not addressed in the claim."}
