{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"virtually every person across this country has seen premiums going up and up and up\" due to Obamacare. This may not be accurate for all individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"virtually every person\" has experienced premium increases because of Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in premiums is solely due to Obamacare, without considering other factors that may contribute to rising healthcare costs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the impact of Obamacare on premiums varies depending on the market segment. It highlights that the individual market, which is where Obamacare has been most active, accounts for less than 10% of Americans with insurance. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that \"virtually every person\" has seen premium increases."}
