{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Gov. Rick Scott's actions by stating that he \"subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools,\" without providing enough context or considering subsequent increases in education funding.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by not acknowledging the subsequent increases in education funding during Gov. Scott's tenure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to substantiate the $1.3 billion subtraction from public schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that any reduction in state money or expiration of federal stimulus funds automatically translates to a negative impact on public schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reduction in state money and expiration of federal stimulus funds, such as broader budget cuts or shifts in funding priorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gov. Scott called for a $1 billion boost to education by the end of his first year, which suggests that the claim's assertion of subtraction may not be entirely accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by cherry-picking Gov. Scott's record on education funding and focusing only on his first year, while ignoring subsequent budgets and increases in education funding."}
