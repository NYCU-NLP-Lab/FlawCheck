{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of defense budget that goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism, as it states that \"very little\" of the budget, less than 10 percent, is allocated for this purpose.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that less than 10 percent of the defense budget is spent on fighting ISIS and international terrorism.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the defense budget should primarily be focused on fighting modern threats like ISIS and international terrorism, rather than considering other national security priorities.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of how the defense budget works, as it only considers the portion of the budget allocated for fighting ISIS and international terrorism, without taking into account other defense-related spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative reasons or priorities for the allocation of defense budget, such as addressing other global threats or maintaining military capabilities for potential conflicts."}
