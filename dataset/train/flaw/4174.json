{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that a zoo in China named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeface, but the expert's verdict confirms that this is a hoax and the Jinhua Zoo did not name a gorilla in that manner.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the naming of the baby gorilla, which contributes to the lack of support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the naming of the baby gorilla as Harambe McHarambeface is true without any verification or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict explains that the hoax story was meant to spoof two internet stories from 2016, including the death of Harambe and the naming contest for a British research vessel. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim is not accurate."}
