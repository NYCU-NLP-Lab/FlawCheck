{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which ExxonMobil \"fought to kill\" the rule. While it is stated that ExxonMobil and other oil industry allies opposed the proposal, the claim does not provide specific evidence of the extent or intensity of their opposition.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the rule in preventing corruption in developing countries. The expert's verdict highlights the goal of the rule to prevent corruption and mentions the potential negative consequences of corruption in resource-rich nations, but the claim does not fully capture this context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that ExxonMobil \"fought to kill\" the rule. While it is mentioned that ExxonMobil and other industry groups opposed the proposal, the claim does not provide specific instances or actions taken by ExxonMobil to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ExxonMobil's opposition to the rule is solely driven by a desire to avoid disclosure of payments made to foreign governments. While this may be a factor, the claim does not consider other potential reasons for opposition, such as concerns about competitive disadvantage or regulatory burden.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for ExxonMobil's opposition to the rule. It presents the opposition as a direct effort to kill the rule without considering other potential motivations or perspectives."}
