{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of funding the authorization that already happened a decade ago in terms of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border. It is not clear how much progress has already been made and how much more funding would be needed.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential challenges and costs associated with securing the border. Critics have called out the proposed wall as a tremendous expense, but the claim does not address these concerns.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that funding the authorization from 2006 would be sufficient to start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that funding the authorization from 2006 would automatically lead to securing the border as promised by Mr. Trump. It does not consider other factors or potential obstacles that may arise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations or approaches to securing the border, such as alternative technologies or strategies that may be more effective or cost-efficient."}
