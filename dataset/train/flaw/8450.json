{"Understate": "The claim may understate the attendance rate of immigrants in court by implying that most immigrants do show up, while the expert's verdict states that only around 60 to 75 percent of non-detained migrants attend their immigration court proceedings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to back up the assertion that most immigrants show up in court.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigrants released from federal custody are more likely to skip court and abscond, without providing sufficient evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why some immigrants may not show up in court, such as difficulties in accessing legal representation or fear of interacting with immigration authorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a significant number of non-detained immigrants have been ordered to be deported because they failed to appear before an immigration judge.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the attendance rate of immigrants in court by not acknowledging the significant number of non-detained immigrants who were ordered to be deported because they were not present in the courtroom."}
