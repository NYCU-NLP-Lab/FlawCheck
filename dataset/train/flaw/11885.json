{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the delegate gap between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton by stating that he trailed her by only 271 delegates, when in fact it was 290 delegates without counting superdelegates.", "Understate": "The claim understates the delegate gap by not including the count of superdelegates, which would have made Clinton's lead seem larger.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that media inclusion of superdelegates affected the delegate totals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the delegate gap, such as the preferences of superdelegates or the overall primary process."}
