{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of President Trump's success with small dollar donations by comparing his fundraising to Obama in 2012 and Clinton and Bernie combined, without providing the full context of the percentage of total individual contributions.", "Understate": "The claim understates the amount of small-dollar donations received by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama by not providing the full context of their respective percentages of total individual contributions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites a Washington Post article that referenced a Campaign Finance Institute report, but the methodology of the report could not be replicated by experts, raising doubts about its accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that small-dollar donations are the only measure of fundraising success, without considering other factors such as total fundraising amounts or the overall support base.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the differences in small-dollar donations between the candidates, such as differences in campaign strategies or the political climate during each election."}
