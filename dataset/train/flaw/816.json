{"Problematic assumption": "Biden assumes that the size of the loans received by businesses determines their size, which may not necessarily be true.", "Lack enough support": "There is no data available on the size of businesses receiving loans, so Biden's claim lacks sufficient evidence.", "Contradict fact": "Biden's definition of \"small business\" conflicts with the definition used by the Small Business Administration and the program administering the loans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Biden's claim fails to consider that the loans may have gone to businesses that meet the criteria of the Small Business Administration but are larger than what Biden considers a small business.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the percentage of loans going to small businesses since it is based on assumptions rather than concrete data.", "Falters at times": "Biden's claim is weakened by the fact that he stated half the jobs in the U.S. are from small businesses, which includes companies with up to 500 employees.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which funds did not go to small businesses, as there is no available data on the size of businesses receiving loans."}
