{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that January through November 2014 were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. This may be an exaggeration as it is based on data up until November and does not include December, which could potentially alter the rankings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that 2014 was the hottest year in history. It only mentions that it is based on records since 1880 and that 14 of the warmest 15 years are from this century.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that unless something dramatic changes in December, 2014 is on track to be the hottest year. This assumption may not hold true if December temperatures significantly deviate from the trend observed in the first 11 months.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in temperatures, such as natural climate variability or other factors beyond human-induced climate change."}
