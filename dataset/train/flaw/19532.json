{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the trade deficits with Canada and Mexico, as the U.S. actually runs a small trade surplus with Canada and the deficit with Mexico is relatively modest compared to other countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the facts and data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, which shows a trade surplus with Canada and a relatively modest deficit with Mexico.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trade deficits with Canada and Mexico are large, without taking into account the trade surplus with Canada and the relatively modest deficit with Mexico compared to other countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the President tends to focus only on goods and ignore services when talking about trade deficits, which leads to a skewed perception of the trade balance."}
