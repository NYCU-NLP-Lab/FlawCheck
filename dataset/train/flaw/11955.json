{"Understate": "The claim states that there is a 'global average' for the number of judges and magistrates to the number of people. This implies that the current situation in Kenya might be understated in terms of the number of judges and magistrates available.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the existence of a global average for the number of judges and magistrates in relation to the population. It is unclear where this information comes from or how it is determined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a global average for the number of judges and magistrates to the number of people exists without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption. It is not clear if this assumption is based on any factual basis or if it is purely speculative.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the current situation in Kenya, such as the efficiency of the judiciary system, the allocation of resources, or other factors that may impact the number of judges and magistrates available."}
