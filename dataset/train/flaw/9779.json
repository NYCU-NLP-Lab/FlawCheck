{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that West Virginia is not the oldest state in the nation, but rather among the oldest. The expert's verdict clarifies that it has the third-highest population of people aged at least 65 and the fourth-oldest median age in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or statistics to back up the statement that West Virginia is the state with the oldest population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that being the state with the oldest population makes West Virginia extremely vulnerable to coronavirus without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that West Virginia's older population may be a contributing factor to its vulnerability to coronavirus, but it does not provide alternative explanations or factors that could also contribute to the vulnerability."}
