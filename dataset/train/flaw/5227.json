{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of students enrolled in failing schools by using the term \"mostly minority\" without providing specific data or evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that 315,000 students are enrolled in failing schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the classification of schools as \"failing\" is accurate and universally accepted without questioning the criteria or methodology used to determine this classification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the performance of schools, such as socio-economic factors or resource allocation, that are not considered in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that about 70 percent of Texas' students in 2011-12 belonged to groups traditionally considered minorities, suggesting that the majority of students in failing schools are minority students.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of failing schools by only mentioning 532 out of 8,500 campuses, which implies that the problem is not as widespread as it may actually be.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing consistent or reliable data to support the statement."}
