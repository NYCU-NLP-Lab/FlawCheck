{"Understate": "The claim underplays the potential impact of climate change on future hurricanes by focusing only on the number of storms and not considering the intensity or other factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of hurricanes is the sole indicator of their impact or significance, without considering other factors such as intensity, damage, or population growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations and scientific consensus that climate change can affect the intensity and behavior of hurricanes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that experts and scientists have warned about the potential impact of climate change on future hurricanes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the certainty of the statement by presenting it as an absolute truth without acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties in the relationship between hurricanes and climate change.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear context or specifying whether it refers to hurricanes worldwide or just in the United States."}
