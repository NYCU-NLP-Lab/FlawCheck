{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that 109 Biafran women are currently in detention, when in fact the photos are from a previous incident and the women have since been released.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the women are being detained solely for holding a flag and asking for a referendum. It relies on a Facebook post and a quote attributed to an IPOB leader without providing additional sources or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the detention of the Biafran women is solely based on their request for a referendum, without considering other possible reasons for their detention.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of security forces and the detention of individuals in the area, such as maintaining law and order or responding to security threats.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos used in the Facebook posts are not recent and do not show women currently in detention. The women have been released according to a Nigerian newspaper.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not consistently provide accurate information, as it relies on outdated photos and does not present a complete picture of the situation. However, it is unclear if this can be categorized as a bias."}
