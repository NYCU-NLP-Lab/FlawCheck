{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the event by stating that indigenous students were shot due to overcrowding at a Mohawk residential school in 1943. This is not supported by any evidence or historical records.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that indigenous students were shot at the Mohawk residential school. The Woodland Cultural Centre, which manages the former school building, has stated that no mass graves or human remains were ever discovered on the school grounds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that overcrowding at the residential school led to the shooting of indigenous students. However, there is no evidence or historical documentation to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no mass grave or human remains were found at the Mohawk residential school. The Woodland Cultural Centre and archaeological searches have confirmed this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo and the story. The original photo used to illustrate the claim is from a different residential school in British Columbia, not the Mohawk Institute in Ontario. This suggests that the claim may be based on misinformation or confusion.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of evidence and support for the alleged shooting of indigenous students. The expert's verdict clearly states that the story is false and no confirmation or basis for the mass grave theory could be found.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading and inaccurate narrative about the shooting of indigenous students at the Mohawk residential school. The expert's verdict debunks this narrative and highlights the lack of evidence or confirmation for such an event."}
