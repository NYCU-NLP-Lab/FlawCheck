Tammy Baldwin's vote against the bill automatically means she supports raising taxes by $858 billion, without considering her stated position on continuing the tax cuts for certain income brackets.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin's vote against the bill, such as concerns about adding to the national debt or disagreement with other provisions within the bill.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the complex nature of the $858 billion figure and not providing a comprehensive analysis of the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin's vote against the bill does not necessarily mean she supports raising taxes by the full $858 billion amount.", "Understate": "None identified."}
