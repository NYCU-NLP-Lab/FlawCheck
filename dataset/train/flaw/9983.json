{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden cast the deciding vote in favor of legislation that taxed Social Security income, when in fact he did not cast the deciding vote in either case.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the legislation passed in 1983 was bipartisan and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, not solely voted for by Joe Biden.", "Understate": "The claim understates the details of the legislation by not mentioning that the vote in 1993 passed largely along party lines and was signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Joe Biden is not a friend to working folks or retirees based solely on his voting record on Social Security.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that taxing Social Security income automatically makes someone unfriendly to working folks or retirees without considering the broader context and reasons behind such legislation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the legislation, such as the need to ensure Social Security's solvency and make changes to the program to address its funding challenges."}
