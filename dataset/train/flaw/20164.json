{"Understate": "The claim may understate McCain's position on the estate tax by simply stating that he opposes its repeal without providing further context or details.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully understand McCain's stance on the estate tax and the reasons behind his votes against repealing it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for McCain's votes against repealing the estate tax, such as his support for a different plan that would render the tax moot for most people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that opposing the repeal of the estate tax automatically means opposing any changes or exemptions to the tax, without considering McCain's proposed plan for a tax exemption on estates worth up to $10 million and a 15 percent tax on larger inheritances.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that McCain supports a plan that would exempt about 95 percent of estate tax returns filed in 2006, which means the tax would only apply to the wealthiest few.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate McCain's opposition to the repeal of the estate tax without fully considering his proposed alternative plan and exemptions."}
