{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of Floridians who are able to vote but are not being informed by the governor. The email states that there are \"over 13,000 Floridians\" in this situation, but it is unclear if this number is accurate or if it has been inflated for dramatic effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the governor is intentionally withholding information from these Floridians. The email mentions a public records request that supposedly discovered \"thousands of rights restoration notifications sitting in storage,\" but it does not provide concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the governor is deliberately not informing these Floridians about their restored voting rights. However, there is no direct evidence or statement from the governor's office to confirm this assumption. It is possible that there are other reasons or logistical challenges behind the alleged lack of communication.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why these Floridians have not been informed about their voting rights. The claim implies that it is solely the governor's responsibility to inform them, but there could be other factors at play, such as bureaucratic issues or communication breakdowns within the Parole Commission.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making broad statements without providing specific details or evidence. For example, it states that the governor \"won't even help the Parole Commission inform citizens,\" but it does not specify what actions or efforts the governor should be taking to fulfill this responsibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any facts or downplaying the significance of the issue."}
