{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of lobbying on the ability of Florida homeowners to use solar panels during Irma. The expert's verdict highlights that lobbying by the utility company had an influence on preventing solar users from accessing sun-based electricity during the aftermath of the hurricane.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to substantiate the assertion that lobbying directly resulted in Florida homeowners being unable to use solar panels during Irma. The expert's verdict, however, provides some information and context regarding the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that lobbying was the sole or primary reason for Florida homeowners being unable to use solar panels during Irma. The expert's verdict suggests that there are other factors at play, such as safety precautions and industry standards, that may have contributed to the limitation of solar panel usage during power outages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Florida homeowners were unable to use solar panels during Irma. The expert's verdict highlights safety precautions and industry-wide standards as alternative explanations for why solar panels must power down during grid outages.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it is not unlawful for residents to have solar panels in Florida, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim implies that homeowners are legally mandated to connect solar panels to the power grid, which is not accurate according to Florida statute.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
