{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which women rely on Planned Parenthood for mammograms. The expert's verdict states that Planned Parenthood's relationship with mammograms is more complicated than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or statistics to support the assertion that millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood for mammograms. The expert's verdict mentions that Planned Parenthood provided other services like cervical cancer screenings and contraceptive services, but does not provide strong evidence for mammograms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood would result in a loss of access to mammograms for millions of women. The expert's verdict mentions that the relationship between Planned Parenthood and mammograms is more complex, suggesting that the assumption may not be entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents Planned Parenthood as the primary provider of mammograms for millions of women, but the expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative providers or resources for mammograms available to women."}
