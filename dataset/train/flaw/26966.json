{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph shows Joe Namath kneeling during the national anthem.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of the photograph by suggesting it is an innocuous moment rather than a political statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that all players used to kneel for the national anthem, as suggested by the text overlaid on the image.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that kneeling during the national anthem only became an issue after Colin Kaepernick started the practice in 2016.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photograph, such as the fact that Namath and Woodall were injured and not participating in the game at the time the photo was taken."}
