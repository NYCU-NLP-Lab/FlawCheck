{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the map by suggesting that it proves wildfires stop at the US-Canada border.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of wildfires north or south of the US border is evidence that climate change is not the cause.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that wildfires stopping at the US-Canada border is proof that climate change is not responsible.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Canada also experiences wildfires, although the frequency and severity may vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that differences in firefighting strategies, land management practices, or climate patterns may contribute to the discrepancy in wildfire occurrence between the US and Canada."}
