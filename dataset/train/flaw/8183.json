{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Fidel Castro said he wouldn't die until the United States was destroyed lacks sufficient evidence or support. The expert's verdict mentions that the joke emerged after Castro's death, and there is no mention of any credible source or reliable evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Fidel Castro made the statement about the United States being destroyed. However, there is no concrete evidence or reliable source provided to support this assumption. It is based on a joke that emerged after Castro's death, which may not be a reliable basis for making such a claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the joke about Castro's statement emerged after his death and was accompanied by a photograph of Donald Trump. This suggests that the claim could be an alternative explanation or interpretation of the joke, rather than a factual statement made by Castro himself.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no mention of Fidel Castro making the statement about the United States being destroyed before his death. The expert's verdict states that no mention of this statement exists before Castro's death, indicating that the claim contradicts the available facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Fidel Castro's statement by suggesting that it was a serious declaration of his intentions. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim emerged as a joke, which suggests a more lighthearted or satirical interpretation rather than a literal statement by Castro.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or mention of the claim understating any facts or downplaying the significance of Fidel Castro's statement."}
