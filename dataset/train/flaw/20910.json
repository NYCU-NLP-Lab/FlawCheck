{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which white-owned companies receive procurement from SAA, stating that it is 98% while black-owned companies only receive 2%. This could be an exaggeration of the actual proportions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the percentages mentioned. It is unclear where the information comes from and how it was calculated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the allocation of procurement by SAA is based solely on race (white-owned vs. black-owned companies), without considering other factors such as competitiveness, quality, or pricing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reported percentages, such as differences in the number or size of white-owned and black-owned companies bidding for SAA procurement contracts.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the representation or involvement of black-owned companies in SAA's procurement. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine if 2% accurately represents the actual proportion.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a comprehensive and balanced view of SAA's procurement practices. It focuses solely on the racial aspect and does not consider other factors that may influence procurement decisions."}
