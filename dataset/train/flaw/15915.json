{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the Texas State Board of Education's decision to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards. The expert's verdict mentions a national outcry and criticism from Bill White, indicating that the issue is significant beyond what is stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Thomas Jefferson was removed from the list of historical figures who inspired political change. The expert's verdict provides some context and quotes from Bill White's email, but additional evidence or sources would be needed to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards was solely influenced by Rick Perry's appointee and implies a negative motive. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the decision was made by the Texas State Board of Education, consisting of multiple members, and provides an alternative explanation from board member Cynthia Dunbar.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that board member Cynthia Dunbar proposed the amendment to remove Jefferson from the suggested list of political philosophers based on a different interpretation of the curriculum standards. This alternative explanation suggests that the decision was not solely motivated by a desire to remove Jefferson but rather a different understanding of the curriculum content.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not indicate any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim itself. However, there may be potential weaknesses in the claim's lack of specific evidence or sources, as mentioned earlier."}
