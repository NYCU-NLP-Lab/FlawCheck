{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the speed of confirming a Supreme Court justice, stating that the fastest confirmation was 47 days, while there have been three justices confirmed in fewer days.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is a Supreme Court session scheduled to begin on October 5, suggesting that there is no court session between the time of the claim and the end of the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement about the fastest confirmation of a Supreme Court justice.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Senate should wait until after the election to confirm a new justice based on the speed of previous confirmations, which may not be a valid or logical assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing incorrect information, such as stating that there is no court session between the time of the claim and the end of the election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the claim may have been made based on incomplete or outdated information, as it does not include the confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh."}
