{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Sen. Ron Johnson exaggerates the number of Guatemalans intending to migrate to the United States. The actual survey results indicate that about 25% of Guatemalans expressed an intention to live or work in another country, not the one-third (33.3%) claimed by Johnson.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any point.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on news reports that inaccurately conveyed the survey results. The actual survey conducted by the Latin American Public Opinion Project at Vanderbilt University found a lower percentage of Guatemalans intending to migrate compared to what Johnson claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Guatemalans intending to migrate would choose the United States as their destination. However, the survey did not ask participants about their preferred destination.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the intention of Guatemalans to migrate to the United States."}
