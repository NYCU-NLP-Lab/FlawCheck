{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or concrete proof to support the allegation that Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years. The source cited by Harry Reid is anonymous and there is no additional evidence provided to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Mitt Romney refused to release his tax returns, it means he did not pay taxes for 10 years. This assumption may not necessarily be true as there could be other reasons for not releasing tax returns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's refusal to release his tax returns, such as concerns about privacy or the potential for political attacks. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mitt Romney and his allies have stated that he has paid taxes every year and that the accusation is incorrect.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it makes a sweeping statement that Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years based on a single anonymous source.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of its consistency and certainty. Harry Reid himself admits that he is not certain about the truth of the allegation and acknowledges that he was told by an anonymous source.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or indication provided in the claim to suggest that the allegation may be understated."}
