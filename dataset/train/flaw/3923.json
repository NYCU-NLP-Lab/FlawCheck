{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or supporting data to back up the assertion that COVID-19 patients dying of other causes contribute to the coronavirus death tolls in Dallas, Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that deaths attributed to COVID-19 are not accurately reported and that deaths from other causes are being mislabeled as COVID-19 deaths without providing sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of COVID-19 by suggesting that deaths from heart attacks and cancer will appear to skyrocket next year due to mislabeling, without considering the potential impact of COVID-19 on these underlying conditions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not specifying which Dallas hospital is allegedly involved and by not providing any evidence or source for the message.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why COVID-19 deaths may be included in the death toll, such as the guidance provided by the US National Center for Health Statistics on certifying COVID-19 deaths."}
