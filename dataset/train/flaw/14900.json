{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people in Wisconsin with a gambling problem by stating that it is over 300,000. This is based on outdated research from 1999 and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a study from 1999 to support the number of people with a gambling problem in Wisconsin. It would be beneficial to have more recent and comprehensive data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval of a new tribal casino in Kenosha will lead to a rise in the number of gambling addicts. This assumption may not be supported by evidence and could be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise in the number of gambling addicts, such as changes in societal attitudes towards gambling or increased accessibility to gambling options."}
