{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the Moon and Mars will appear of equal size in the night sky is an exaggeration.

The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been debunked by fact-checking organizations and NASA, who have provided evidence and explanations to counter the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Moon and Mars will appear of equal size in the night sky, which is a problematic assumption.

Therefore, assuming that the Moon and Mars will appear of equal size is incorrect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that the hoax is based on the astronomical phenomenon of opposition, where Mars and the sun are on directly opposite sides of Earth. However, this does not mean that Mars will appear as large as the Moon in the night sky.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mars does not look the same as a full Moon, even with magnification. NASA has repeatedly warned people not to believe this claim and has provided factual information to counter it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it has been circulating since at least 2003, according to the expert's verdict. Despite being debunked by fact-checking organizations and NASA, people continue to share the claim on social media platforms."}
