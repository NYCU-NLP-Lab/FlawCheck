{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation provided to prove that Zoom allows hosts to hear participants whose microphones are turned off.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the TikTok videos alleging that school administrators or teachers can hear students with their microphones turned off are true, without verifying the authenticity or credibility of these videos.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the interactions shown in the TikTok videos, such as the alleged teacher being able to hear the student through other means, like video or chat messages, rather than through the microphone.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by Zoom's Help Center, which states that participants can mute or unmute themselves, unless the host has prevented them from unmuting. This suggests that hosts cannot hear participants whose microphones are turned off.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it presents the TikTok videos as evidence of a widespread feature or program that allows authority figures to secretly listen in on Zoom users, without considering the possibility of the videos being staged or manipulated.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying solely on the TikTok videos as evidence, without considering other factors or conducting a thorough investigation into the alleged feature or program."}
