{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Russ Feingold's support for giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support or evidence to prove that Russ Feingold actually voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a vote on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 automatically means support for giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Russ Feingold's vote on the amendment, such as supporting the overall immigration reform bill rather than specifically supporting Social Security benefits for illegal immigrants."}
