{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm that the Pakistani government has granted Lahore airport a license to sell alcohol. The information provided in the reports and press releases is conflicting and does not provide concrete proof of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of consistency and clarity. The reports and press releases mentioned in the expert's verdict provide contradictory information, making it difficult to determine the veracity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval from the PTI-led government for a duty-free shop to sell alcoholic beverages at the airport implies a grant of a liquor license. However, this assumption may not necessarily be true, as the purpose of the duty-free shop could be for international travelers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which suggests that the liquor availability mentioned in the reports and press releases may be related to the upcoming hotel at Lahore airport, rather than the airport itself. The press release from Swiss International Hotels clarifies that the hotel is separate from the airport.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the liquor availability is associated with the upcoming hotel at Lahore airport, rather than the airport itself. The press release from Swiss International Hotels clearly states that the hotel is located 500 meters from the Allama Iqbal International Airport.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the availability of alcohol at Lahore airport based on the reports and press releases. The reports mention the approval for a duty-free shop to sell alcoholic beverages, but it does not necessarily imply that alcohol will be served throughout the airport.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any information or downplaying its significance."}
