{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of rejected vote by mail ballots in DeKalb County. The actual number is around 200, not 40,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion of 40,000 rejected vote by mail ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 40,000 rejected vote by mail ballots need to be cured by Friday or they will be tossed, which is not accurate. The actual number of ballots needing to be cured is much lower.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the DeKalb County Board of Registration and Elections has debunked it and clarified that only around 200 ballots need to be cured.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The confusion in the claim could be due to a misinterpretation of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's statement about the number of ballots left to be counted."}
