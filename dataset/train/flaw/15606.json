{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that James Comey covered up Seth Rich's links to WikiLeaks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that James Comey locked down the contents of Rich's laptop to protect certain individuals or groups without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the FBI's possession of Rich's laptop and the subsequent investigation, such as standard investigative procedures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Seth Rich was killed before WikiLeaks released the hacked DNC emails, making it unlikely that there is a direct link between his death and the email dump.", "Understate": "The claim potentially understates the complexity of the investigation and the multiple factors involved in the release of the DNC emails.", "Falters at times": "The claim relies on the statements of a private investigator who later backtracked on his claims, indicating a potential inconsistency or faltering in the evidence provided.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
