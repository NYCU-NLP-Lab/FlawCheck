{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that a video showing highly censored female athletes competing in the 2016 Olympics was broadcast by the Iranian Sports Channel.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video in question is a real broadcast from the Iranian Sports Channel, which is not supported by the expert's verdict. The expert states that the video is at least three years old, depicts events from previous years, and was likely created for a satirical television program.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question is not a real broadcast from the Iranian Sports Channel. The expert's verdict clearly states that the video is not from the Iranian Sports Channel and the censorship bars shown in the video were not added by the broadcaster.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the female athletes in the video were \"highly censored\" when the expert's verdict describes the censorship bars as humorously inept.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict, which suggests that the video was likely created for a satirical television program and not a real broadcast from the Iranian Sports Channel."}
