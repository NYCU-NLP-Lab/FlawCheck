{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of people infected in the Jahangirpuri area. While the claim mentions that 26 members of one family tested positive, it fails to mention the total number of positive cases in the area, which is 31 according to other sources.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to verify the statement made by the expert. It only provides quotes from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and various news sources, but there is no additional data or research provided to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 26 members of the family contracted the virus by visiting each other's homes despite containment measures. However, it does not provide concrete evidence or alternative explanations for how the entire family became infected.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for how the family members may have contracted the virus. It solely focuses on the assumption that they became infected by visiting each other's homes, without considering other possible sources of transmission.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the North District Magistrate did not state that a 26-member family was infected. This suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the information provided by the authorities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and consistent narrative. It includes quotes and information from multiple sources, which may lead to confusion or inconsistencies in the overall understanding of the situation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
