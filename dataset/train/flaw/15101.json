{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of the number of people stabbed to death compared to those killed with rifles. It presents the statistic as if it is a shocking revelation, implying that it is a major issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up its assertion. It simply references a Breitbart article and the FBI crime data without further analysis or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing the number of people stabbed to death with rifles is a valid and meaningful comparison. It fails to consider other factors such as overall firearm-related deaths or the different contexts in which these weapons are used.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the rise of mass shootings. It simplifies the issue by solely focusing on the number of people stabbed to death versus those killed with rifles.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the odds of being murdered by a firearm are nearly seven times higher than the odds of being murdered by a knife or cutting instrument, as mentioned by Dr. James Nolan.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the overall impact of firearm-related deaths by focusing only on the specific comparison between stabbings and rifle deaths. It fails to provide a comprehensive picture of the issue."}
