{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the connection between the Muslim Brotherhood and the 9/11 conspirators by implying that many of them came directly from the Muslim Brotherhood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Muslim Brotherhood and the 9/11 conspirators have a direct and significant connection without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that many of the 9/11 conspirators came from the Muslim Brotherhood.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the involvement of the 9/11 conspirators, such as individual radicalization or other extremist groups.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida are now bitter rivals, with the Muslim Brotherhood denouncing al-Qaida and vice versa.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the relationship between the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida, as some members of the Muslim Brotherhood have joined al-Qaida due to dissatisfaction with the Brotherhood's approach.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to establish a clear and definitive connection between the Muslim Brotherhood and the 9/11 conspirators, as it relies on general statements and lacks specific evidence."}
