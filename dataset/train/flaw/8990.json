{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the gender wage gap by stating that women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. The expert's verdict mentions that the U.N. report cited by Carter's camp does not provide a specific percentage for the United States, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the U.N. report cited by Carter's camp does not provide a specific percentage for the United States. This lack of specific data to support the claim suggests that it may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender wage gap in the United States is directly caused by religious leaders who do not view women as equal. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence and may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the U.N. report cited by Carter's camp shows an international pay gap of 10 percent to 30 percent for 83 countries polled. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the gender wage gap in the United States, such as factors beyond religious ordination.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that Carter's figure and characterization of the gender wage gap may be different from the actual amount. This suggests that the claim may contradict the actual facts regarding the gender wage gap in the United States."}
