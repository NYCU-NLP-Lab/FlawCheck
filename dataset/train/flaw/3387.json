{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of illnesses caused by raw milk in Texas by stating that no illnesses have been reported in more than four years, while there were actually up to 10 suspected illnesses in 2015 alone.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that no illnesses have been reported from raw milk in Texas in more than four years and only six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of reported illnesses means there have been no actual illnesses caused by raw milk, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the reported illnesses, such as the possibility of unreported cases or cases not directly linked to raw milk consumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been illnesses caused by raw milk in Texas, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the number of illnesses and failing to consider the CDC's data on foodborne outbreaks and illnesses linked to raw milk."}
