{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the job growth in the private sector in Texas over the past decade. While the claim states that 1 million jobs were created, the expert's verdict indicates that the increase in jobs during that period was closer to 1.1 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify the number of jobs created in the private sector in Texas over the past decade. The expert's verdict mentions that they wondered whether all the 1.1 million net increase in jobs occurred in the private sector, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the job growth in Texas, such as the state's economy already being strong before Perry became governor. This indicates that factors other than Perry's policies may have contributed to the job growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job growth in the private sector in Texas is solely attributed to Perry's tenure as governor. However, the expert's verdict mentions that more than 20 states also experienced net job gains during the same period, indicating that other factors may have influenced the job growth in Texas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that government jobs in Texas increased by 19 percent during Perry's tenure, while private sector jobs saw only a 9 percent increase. This contradicts Perry's statement that the private sector created 1 million jobs while government jobs increased.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the job growth in the private sector in Texas over the past decade. The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in jobs during that period was closer to 1.1 million, which is slightly higher than the claim's stated 1 million jobs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear breakdown of the job growth between the private sector and the government sector in Texas. The expert's verdict raises doubts about whether all the job growth occurred in the private sector, indicating a lack of clarity in the claim."}
