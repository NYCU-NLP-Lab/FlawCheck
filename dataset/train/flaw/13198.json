{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the Republican National Committee (RNC) officially adopted support for conversion therapy. While there were reports of language supporting conversion therapy being included in the 2016 RNC platform, it is unclear if it was officially adopted or if it was later moderated.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the details of the RNC's stance on conversion therapy. It mentions that the RNC adopted support for conversion therapy as part of their platform, but the provided evidence suggests that the language supporting conversion therapy was initially more explicit and was later moderated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that the RNC officially adopted support for conversion therapy. The evidence provided includes reports and statements from news outlets, but it does not provide a direct statement or official document from the RNC confirming their adoption of such support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by stating that conversion therapy is a discredited practice. While it is widely criticized by many professional organizations and experts, it is important to note that there may be differing opinions on the effectiveness and ethical implications of conversion therapy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the inclusion of language supporting conversion therapy in the RNC platform. It is mentioned that Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council and a delegate from Louisiana, drafted the language, but the motivations and reasons behind its inclusion are not explored in the provided evidence."}
