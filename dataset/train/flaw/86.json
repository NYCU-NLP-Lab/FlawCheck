{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the ratings given by CharityWatch, which is a smaller and less highly regarded organization compared to Charity Navigator.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ratings given by CharityWatch are more accurate or reliable than those of Charity Navigator, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the ratings difference, such as different evaluation criteria used by CharityWatch and Charity Navigator.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by causing skepticism among social media users who were unable to independently corroborate the claim, due to confusion between CharityWatch and Charity Navigator.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the dispute and allegations of lack of transparency surrounding the Clinton Foundation, which led to Charity Navigator temporarily stopping its evaluation of the foundation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Charity Navigator reinstated the Clinton Foundation's rating in September 2016, suggesting that the dispute and allegations were resolved to some extent.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the importance of the ratings difference between the Clinton Foundation and the Red Cross, as it does not provide any context or comparison of other charities' ratings."}
