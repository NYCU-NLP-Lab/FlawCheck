{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the damage caused by Iranian missile strikes in Iraq by falsely stating that U.S. planes were on fire.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo in question is from a previous Israeli missile strike in the Gaza Strip, not from the recent Iranian missile strikes in Iraq.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that U.S. planes were on fire after the Iranian missile strikes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo shared by the Iranian news agency accurately represents the aftermath of the Iranian missile strikes, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo, such as the possibility of it being a recycled image used by \"Iran's online operatives\" to mislead viewers."}
