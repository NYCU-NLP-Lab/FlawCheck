{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the results of the \"Cinderella Surgery\" by showing a foot that has been surgically modified to resemble a high heel shoe, which is not an accurate representation of the actual procedure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the existence of the \"Cinderella Surgery\" and the extreme results shown in the image.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image is a true representation of the \"Cinderella Surgery\" without verifying its authenticity or providing credible sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it is a digitally manipulated artwork by Matilde Pernille and not a real foot after the surgery."}
