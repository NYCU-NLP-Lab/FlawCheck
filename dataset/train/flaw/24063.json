{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that oil imports have actually declined in recent years after peaking in 2005 and 2006, as confirmed by the Energy Information Administration and the American Petroleum Institute.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed by accurate data and studies conducted by the government and the energy industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that oil imports are higher than ever, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decline in oil imports, such as the decline in consumption, the proliferation of gasoline-ethanol blends, and the increase in domestic oil production.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual decrease in oil imports, as studies suggest that imported oil will be down by about 20 percent in two decades."}
