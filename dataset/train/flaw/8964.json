{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there are over 15 million Nigerians in the diaspora lacks enough support as different sources provide varying estimates of the diaspora population, ranging from 1.7 million to 15 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Nigerians in the diaspora send back remittances, which may not be accurate as not all individuals in the diaspora engage in remittance activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the estimated $25 billion in annual remittances, such as the inclusion of remittances from sources other than Nigerians in the diaspora.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (Desa) estimated Nigeria's diaspora population as 1.7 million as of June 2020, which is significantly lower than the claim of over 15 million Nigerians in the diaspora.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the volume of remittances by stating an estimated $25 billion in annual remittances without providing concrete evidence or data to support this figure.", "Understate": "It is unclear if the claim understates any aspect as there is no specific evidence or information provided that suggests understatement."}
