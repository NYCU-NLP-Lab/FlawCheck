{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim of prolonged use of face masks causing hypercapnia is an understatement. The expert states that there should be no issue with prolonged mask use unless it is a plastic impermeable mask, and that cloth masks and medical masks will not cause hypercapnia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not specify a type of mask or define the \"prolonged\" use.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that prolonged use of face masks disrupts the normal airway and breathing process, leading to excessive carbon dioxide inhalation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that hypercapnia usually occurs as a result of hypoventilation or not being able to breathe properly and get oxygen into the lungs."}
