{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the referendum on the selection of the chief justice. The expert's verdict mentions that the referendum would not directly elect a chief justice, but it does not fully explore the potential consequences or implications of this change.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current system, where the justice who has served longest is automatically made chief, is the best or most democratic method for selecting the chief justice. The expert's verdict acknowledges that the referendum would change the process for deciding the chief justice, suggesting that there may be alternative methods that could be considered.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that the referendum would take \"the choice of chief justice\" away from the people. The expert's verdict explains the current process and the proposed change, but does not provide extensive evidence or analysis to fully evaluate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives for the proposed change in the selection process. The expert's verdict mentions that the referendum would have political implications, suggesting that there may be alternative reasons or motivations for the change.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the current system for selecting the chief justice is based on seniority, not direct election by the people. The expert's verdict explains the current process and the proposed change, highlighting that the referendum would not directly elect the chief justice."}
