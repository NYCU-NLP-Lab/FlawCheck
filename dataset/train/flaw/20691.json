{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that almost 75% of deaths from COVID-19 in Texas are among people aged 65 and older. The claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, but the data provided only includes investigated deaths, which were fewer than half of the total deaths at the time the claim was made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of COVID-19 deaths in Texas are among people aged 65 and older, without considering other factors such as underlying health conditions or comorbidities that may contribute to the deaths. The claim does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the factors that may be involved in COVID-19 deaths.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of COVID-19 on younger age groups by focusing primarily on the percentage of deaths among people aged 65 and older. The data provided in the expert's verdict shows that there have been deaths among younger age groups as well, although the percentages are lower.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any known facts or information. The claim is based on the data provided by the Texas Department of Health Services, although it may lack sufficient support.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the impact of COVID-19 on people aged 65 and older. It accurately states that almost 75% of investigated deaths in Texas were among this age group, based on the available data.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing a comprehensive analysis of all the factors contributing to COVID-19 deaths in Texas. It focuses primarily on age as a factor without considering other variables that may be involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the high percentage of deaths among people aged 65 and older in Texas. It does not explore other factors that may contribute to the disproportionate impact on this age group."}
