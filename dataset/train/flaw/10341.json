{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Michigan government offices provide information in Arabic and allow polygamous Muslim men to apply for public assistance benefits for up to four wives. The expert's verdict states that \"some\" Michigan government offices provide information and services in Arabic, indicating that it is not all offices. Additionally, the claim does not provide evidence or statistics to support the assertion that polygamous Muslim men are actively applying for public assistance benefits for multiple wives.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of information in Arabic and the allowance of polygamous Muslim men to apply for public assistance benefits for multiple wives is a negative or problematic situation. This assumption is not supported by evidence or a clear rationale.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate its assertion. It relies on anecdotal information and an unverified phone call to the Michigan Department of Human Services, without providing any official documentation or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of information in Arabic and the allowance of polygamous Muslim men to apply for public assistance benefits for multiple wives. It does not explore potential cultural or legal reasons behind these practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States does not allow multiple marriages and that polygamy is illegal. The expert's verdict acknowledges that polygamous Muslim men can apply for public assistance benefits for up to four wives, but it does not specify whether this is a legal or illegal practice."}
