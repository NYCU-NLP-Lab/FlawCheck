{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of people kicked off the voting rolls in Wisconsin by using the phrase \"hundreds of thousands.\" While there were significant voter purges in 2017 and 2018, the exact number of people affected is not specified in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls.\" Although a report from the Center for Media and Democracy is mentioned, it does not provide a direct link to the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the voter purges mentioned in 2017 and 2018 are still ongoing, without providing clear evidence for this assumption. The claim also suggests that the purges are happening at the time of the statement, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or reasons for the voter purges in Wisconsin. It does not mention the legal requirements or the reasons behind the purges, such as inactive voter status or failure to respond to registration notices."}
