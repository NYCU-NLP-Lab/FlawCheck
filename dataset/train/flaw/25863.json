{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of federal judges that were not appointed during Obama's presidency. The expert's verdict clarifies that the reason Trump was left with many vacancies is because Republicans stopped confirming federal judges appointed by Obama in his final two years as president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that Obama left over 100 federal judges unappointed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama intentionally left vacant federal judge positions as a \"present\" for Trump, suggesting complacency on Obama's part. However, the expert's verdict explains that the reason for the vacancies was due to Republicans blocking Obama's judicial nominees in his final two years as president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the vacancies, stating that Republicans virtually stopped confirming federal judges appointed by Obama during his final two years as president. This contradicts the claim's assumption that Obama intentionally left the vacancies as a gift."}
