{"Exaggerate": "The claim of 500-2000 Rohingya Muslims on a prowl in Madhya Pradesh to kidnap children may be an exaggeration as there is no evidence to support this specific number or the claim itself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Rohingya Muslims are involved in criminal activities, which is a problematic assumption as it generalizes an entire community based on the actions of a few individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, which suggests that it is not related to Rohingya Muslims but rather footage from a prison riot in Brazil."}
