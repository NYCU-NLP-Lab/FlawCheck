{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Hillary Clinton's stance on increasing the number of Syrian refugees by stating that she wants to increase it by 500 percent. The actual statement made by Clinton suggests a 550 percent increase, which is slightly different.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the assertion that Clinton wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees by 500 percent. It only provides a few quotes from Clinton without any additional context or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increasing the number of Syrian refugees is a negative action without providing any reasoning or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for Clinton's stance on accepting Syrian refugees, such as humanitarian reasons or the belief that the United States should play a role in addressing the global refugee crisis."}
