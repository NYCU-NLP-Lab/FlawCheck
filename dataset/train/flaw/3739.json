{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount that the average American family spends on health care coverage. It states that the average family spends \"over $13,000 a year,\" but the expert's verdict clarifies that this figure includes the total cost of health care premiums, not just the amount the average family pays out of pocket.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average American family's health care spending is unsustainable and will continue to increase significantly in the future. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to accurately represent the average American family's health care spending. The expert's verdict explains that the figure of $13,375 comes from a study of employer-provided health care, and it does not represent the amount the average family pays out of pocket.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the claim. It states that the employer pays the majority of the health care costs, not the average family, which contradicts the claim's implication that families are solely responsible for the high spending."}
