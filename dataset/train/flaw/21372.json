{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a poll conducted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which shows that a significant percentage of gun owners, including NRA members, believe that everyone has a criminal background check. However, the specific details of the poll, such as the sample size and methodology, are not provided, which could raise questions about the reliability and validity of the results.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the belief of NRA members about universal background checks reflects the actual knowledge and understanding of the law. However, it is possible that the respondents in the poll misunderstood the question or were not fully informed about the existing background check requirements.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of NRA members who believe that everyone has a criminal background check. The claim only mentions that \"even members of the NRA\" were under the impression, but does not specify the exact proportion or provide any comparative data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why NRA members may believe that everyone has a criminal background check. It is possible that NRA members are aware of the existing background check requirements for federally licensed gun dealers but may not be knowledgeable about the lack of requirements for private sellers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a direct link to the poll or the specific details of the poll conducted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. This lack of transparency and accessibility to the poll data weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that background checks are not required for private sales, only for sales by federally licensed gun dealers. The claim implies that everyone has a criminal background check, which is not true under current laws.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which NRA members believe that everyone has a criminal background check. The claim states that \"even members of the NRA\" were under the impression, suggesting that this belief is surprising or unexpected, but without further information, it is unclear how widespread this belief is among NRA members."}
