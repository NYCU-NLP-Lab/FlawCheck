{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by suggesting that anyone can buy a gun online with no background check or questions asked, when in fact there are certain limitations and legal requirements in place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to prove that violent felons can easily purchase guns online without a background check.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current system allows violent felons to buy guns online without any restrictions or background checks, which may be an oversimplification of the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the purchase of guns by violent felons online is illegal but can still happen due to loopholes in the law and the lack of background checks by non-licensed sellers."}
