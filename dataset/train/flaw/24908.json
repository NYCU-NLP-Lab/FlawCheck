{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the incident by implying that it happened recently during the recent polling in Meerut, while the incident actually took place during the 2017 Uttar Pradesh civic polls.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a viral video and social media captions as evidence, without any official investigation or verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the EVM malfunction was intentional and aimed at favoring the BJP, without providing any concrete evidence or proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation mentioned in the expert's verdict that the incident occurred during the 2017 Uttar Pradesh civic polls and similar allegations had been made earlier as well."}
