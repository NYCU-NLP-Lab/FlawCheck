{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the president's spending by stating that it \"stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion debt.\" The expert's verdict acknowledges that the cost per person is accurate but also states that it is slightly understated at $50,900.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual cost per person by stating it as $50,000 instead of the more accurate estimate of $50,900.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to directly link the president's spending to the entire $16 trillion national debt. The expert's verdict mentions that the national debt has increased by $5.4 trillion during Obama's presidency, but it does not provide a direct causal relationship between the spending and the debt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the president's spending is solely responsible for the $16 trillion national debt, without considering other factors or contributors to the debt. The expert's verdict mentions that the debt has increased by $5.4 trillion during Obama's presidency but does not attribute the entire debt to his spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the national debt, such as economic factors or other government policies. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama oversaw the lowest annual increases in spending among the past ten presidents, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to the debt.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the cost per person is slightly higher than stated, with an average share of about $50,900 instead of $50,000. The expert's verdict confirms this discrepancy."}
