{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Hillary Clinton's statement by omitting the context in which she made it. The clip circulating on Facebook leaves the impression that she had plans to attack Iran irrespective of the country's actions, which is an exaggeration of her actual stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the posts show video clips beginning with Hillary Clinton saying, \"If I'm the president, we will attack Iran.\" The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides specific details and sources to support their explanation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the video clips circulating on Facebook accurately represent Hillary Clinton's stance on attacking Iran. The expert's verdict clarifies that the clips are taken out of context and do not accurately reflect her actual position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video clips, such as the possibility of them being manipulated or edited to misrepresent Hillary Clinton's statements. The expert's verdict provides the alternative explanation that the clips were spliced and circulated without context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hillary Clinton's statement about attacking Iran was made in response to a hypothetical nuclear attack by Iran on Israel. The claim presents her statement as if it was a general plan to attack Iran, which is a contradiction of the actual context in which it was made.", "Understate": "There does not seem to be any significant understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
