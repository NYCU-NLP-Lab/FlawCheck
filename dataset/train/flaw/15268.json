{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the salary of a third-year teacher by stating they are making more than $90,000 a year. It is stated that experienced teachers in the Dallas school district can earn a $90,000 base salary, but it typically takes years to reach that level.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific details or evidence to support the statement that a third-year teacher in Dallas is making over $90,000 a year. The specific teacher mentioned in the claim is not identified, and there is no further information provided to verify the salary claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the salary of one teacher represents the typical salary for all third-year teachers in Dallas. It does not consider the variations in salaries based on factors such as experience, performance, and other factors like being bilingual or teaching in low-performing schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the high salary mentioned in the claim, such as additional stipends, bonuses, or other factors tied to performance or specific initiatives in the Dallas school district. The claim does not provide enough information to determine the exact reasons for the high salary mentioned."}
