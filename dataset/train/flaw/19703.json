{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200 to a federal political campaign. The data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the actual percentage is higher than what the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the statement that less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200 to a federal political campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the domination of big money in politics is solely determined by the percentage of the population giving over $200 to political campaigns. This assumption may overlook other factors and alternative explanations for the influence of big donors in politics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the domination of big money in politics, such as the role of corporate donations or the influence of lobbying groups. It simplifies the issue by solely focusing on individual donations over $200.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of Americans contributing over $200 in an election cycle. The experts' analysis suggests that the actual percentage is higher than what the claim suggests, with 0.12% of the population giving over $200 to political campaigns.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the percentage of Americans giving over $200 to political campaigns, as the data provided by the experts contradicts the claim and shows a higher percentage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Center for Responsive Politics data shows that 366,000 people have given $200 or more in the 2013-14 election cycle, which is significantly higher than the claim's suggestion of less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the population."}
