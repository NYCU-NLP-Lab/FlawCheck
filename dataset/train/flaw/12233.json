The expert's verdict shows that there were other laws and measures that could fall into the broad categories of education and workforce issues, even if the connection is tenuous.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of specific laws passed by Joe Morrissey to help the black community with education or workforce. The expert's verdict mentions that Morrissey was often among dozens of fellow lawmakers who supported bills, suggesting that the legislative process involves collaboration and multiple contributors."}
