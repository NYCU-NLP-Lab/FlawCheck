{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of starting quarterbacks the Chicago Bears have had in the last 10 years compared to the total number of tenured faculty fired in the last two decades.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the comparison between the number of starting quarterbacks and the number of tenured faculty fired.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in quarterback turnover and faculty dismissals, such as the nature of the professions or the criteria for termination.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of starting quarterbacks and the number of tenured faculty fired are directly comparable measures of instability or inconsistency.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim falters in accurately representing the quarterback situation for the Green Bay Packers, which may undermine the credibility of the overall comparison.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential reasons for faculty dismissals, as it only focuses on the tenure policy changes and does not consider other factors that could lead to faculty terminations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Green Bay Packers had a total of nine games started by quarterbacks other than Favre or Rodgers during the same period, suggesting that the Bears did not have more starting quarterbacks than any other team."}
