{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because the expert's verdict mentions that Walker first said the \"teachers are thugs\" comment came from the internet, but later flatly denied saying it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific evidence or quotes provided to back up the statement that Walker never called teachers \"thugs\" and only said positive things about them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that there is a fight over Walker's curbs on unions, but it does not provide any context or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origin of the \"teachers are thugs\" reference, such as other public officials and commentators using the term \"thug\" in relation to the collective bargaining battle."}
