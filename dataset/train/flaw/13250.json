It does not provide any specific instances or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the financial crisis was solely predicted by Elizabeth Warren and that nobody wanted to listen to her warnings. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there were multiple factors contributing to the crisis and that Warren's warnings were not widely heeded.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the financial crisis, such as the role of banks, government policies, and lax regulation. It simplifies the cause of the crisis to solely Warren's warnings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Warren's warnings were indeed acknowledged and confirmed by experts. The expert's verdict provides evidence of Warren's prior warnings and her expertise in the field.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the speaker talked about the financial crisis. Without specific evidence or examples, it is unclear how frequently or extensively the speaker discussed the crisis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear timeline of when the speaker talked about the financial crisis. It only mentions that the crisis hit in 2007-2008, but it does not specify when the speaker's warnings occurred."}
