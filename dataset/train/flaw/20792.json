This contradicts the claim's implication that the law would have been relevant to his situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation provides an alternative explanation for Mayor Bell's job loss, stating that it was a result of a strike by municipal employees and a budget crisis rather than solely due to the city running out of money."}
