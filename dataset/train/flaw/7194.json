{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the number of \"missing\" mail-in ballots by using the term \"missing\" instead of \"uncast\" or \"unreturned.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the 28 million figure primarily represents uncast ballots and not necessarily missing ballots.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 28 million mail-in ballots went missing. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure is drawn from data compiled by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), but it also notes that some areas, like Chicago, did not respond to the survey questions, suggesting incomplete data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the unreturned mail-in ballots indicate widespread voter fraud. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that there is no evidence of fraudulent use of the missing ballots and that the sheer volume of unreturned ballots raises doubts about election security but not necessarily fraud.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the unreturned mail-in ballots, stating that they were simply uncast or unmarked and sent back, rather than mysteriously disappearing or never arriving.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 28 million unreturned mail-in ballots were not necessarily missing but rather uncast or unreturned by voters. The expert's verdict clarifies this distinction.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the 28 million unreturned mail-in ballots by presenting them as evidence of widespread voter fraud. The expert's verdict emphasizes that the missing ballots do not necessarily indicate fraud and that the headline and opening of the article may have misled readers into thinking that millions of ballots mysteriously vanished.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using the term \"missing\" instead of more accurate descriptors like \"uncast\" or \"unreturned.\" The expert's verdict points out this flaw in the claim's wording."}
