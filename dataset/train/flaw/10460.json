{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered to exaggerate the extent to which it was \"unquestionably\" not within the governor's legal authority to postpone the primary election. Experts suggest that while it may not have been within his authority to do so unilaterally, there were potential options for the governor to explore, such as involving the Illinois General Assembly.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or legal references to substantiate the assertion that it was \"unquestionably\" not within the governor's legal authority to postpone the primary election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the governor's inability to postpone the primary election unilaterally implies a complete lack of legal authority to do so. However, experts suggest that there may have been alternative legal avenues for the governor to explore, such as involving the Illinois General Assembly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the governor could have pursued legal avenues, similar to what Ohio's governor did, to seek a court order or involve the Illinois General Assembly in determining a new date for the primary election.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the potential options available to the governor in addressing the primary election situation. Experts suggest that the governor's administration could have attempted similar actions to Ohio, potentially forcing the Illinois General Assembly to establish a new date for the election."}
