{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the increase in the national debt under both President George W. Bush and President Obama. The expert's verdict mentions that there are at least two ways to measure the national debt, which suggests that the claim may not provide the full context or may present the numbers in a way that emphasizes the increase.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the increase in the national debt under both presidents. The expert's verdict mentions that it is tricky to calculate how much debt Obama is responsible for adding, and that several big-ticket budgetary items could be attributed to a combination of the two presidents. This suggests that the claim may not fully account for the complexities and factors contributing to the debt increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully validate the numbers provided. The expert's verdict mentions that there are disputes and challenges in assessing the claim, including the different ways to measure the national debt and the complexities of attributing debt increases to specific presidents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the national debt increase under both presidents is solely their responsibility. The expert's verdict mentions that presidents inherit budget policies from their predecessors and that certain budgetary items could be attributed to a combination of the two presidents. This suggests that the claim may oversimplify the factors contributing to the debt increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the increase in the national debt, such as the economic free-fall that Obama inherited and the complex factors involved in attributing debt increases to specific presidents. This suggests that the claim may not fully consider or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
