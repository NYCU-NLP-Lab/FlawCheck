{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that under the Biden administration, the stimulus cheques will not be signed by the President.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Trump's signature on the stimulus cheques, implying that he is still the President.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a single image of a cheque with Trump's name and does not provide any additional evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the stimulus cheques issued from March 2021 will still bear Trump's signature, which is not the case under the Biden administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that the image of the cheque with Trump's signature is taken out of context and does not represent the current stimulus cheques being issued."}
