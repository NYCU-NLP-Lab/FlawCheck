{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"liberal\" protesters carried a banner calling for Republicans to be assassinated, when in reality the banner read \"Trump makes America hate, our students make America great.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is derived from shoddy image editing of a real photograph from a protest against Donald Trump, rather than providing direct evidence of \"liberal\" protesters carrying a banner calling for Republican assassination.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the modified version of the meme, which includes the text \"Openly calling for assassination. Guess what comes next...war,\" is representative of the original protest, when in fact it is a separate iteration of the meme.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original photograph and banner were from a protest against Donald Trump, not specifically targeting Republicans for assassination.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the meme and claim were created as part of a larger effort to inflame anger and divisiveness using image manipulation, disinformation, and propaganda."}
