{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which high school graduation rates have been lifted to \"new highs.\" While the rates have increased, it is unclear if they are truly at an all-time high.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the uncertainty and lack of comparability in the data used to calculate graduation rates. The expert mentions that the current method for calculating rates is only 5 years old, and there is uncertainty about the comparability of rates from previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to definitively prove that high school graduation rates have reached \"new highs.\" The expert mentions that the rates have been rising, but it is unclear if they are at the highest level ever.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high school graduation rates have never been higher without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert mentions that the rates have increased, but it is unclear if they are truly at the highest level ever.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in high school graduation rates, such as changes in educational policies or improvements in educational resources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the current method for calculating graduation rates is only 5 years old and there is uncertainty about the comparability of rates from previous years."}
