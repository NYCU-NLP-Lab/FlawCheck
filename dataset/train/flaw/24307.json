{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Bernie Sanders applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. The expert's verdict clarifies that Sanders did oppose the war and applied for this status, which is different from evading the draft through illegal or unethical means.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Bernie Sanders \"dodged the draft\" during the Vietnam War. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Sanders applied for conscientious objector status, which suggests that he did not evade the draft but rather objected to military service based on his beliefs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that applying for conscientious objector status is equivalent to \"dodging the draft.\" The expert's verdict explains the specific definition and connotation of the term \"draft dodger,\" which does not apply to conscientious objectors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Bernie Sanders opposed the Vietnam War and applied for conscientious objector status based on his beliefs. The expert's verdict provides this alternative explanation and clarifies that Sanders did not evade the draft but rather objected to serving in the war."}
