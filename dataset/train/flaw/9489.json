{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Trump's border wall is \"almost complete\" is an exaggeration, as it contradicts information from the CBP, which states that only 458 miles out of 738 miles funded have been finished as of January 2021.", "Contradict fact": "Trump's claim about the state of the wall contradicts the information provided by the CBP, which shows that only a portion of the funded miles have been completed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the wall is \"almost complete.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the completion of \"little sections\" of the wall would make it \"just magnificent,\" without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as Biden opposes the wall and has ordered a pause on existing construction projects, indicating that the wall may not be as close to completion as claimed by Trump."}
