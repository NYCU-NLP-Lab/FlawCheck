{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount spent on illegal immigrants by stating that the state of Illinois spent about $320 million over the last six years. This bias is suggested by the statement that the claim is based on audits conducted by the Illinois auditor general, but no data is available for fiscal year 2015.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no data available for fiscal year 2015, and it is unclear how the costs of health care for undocumented children fit into the overall state budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the costs associated with All Kids program were solely paid by Illinois taxpayers, without any federal government matching funds. This assumption may be problematic as it is not clearly supported by the information provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the costs associated with the All Kids program, such as the inclusion of other eligible populations or factors not mentioned in the article. However, this bias is not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict."}
