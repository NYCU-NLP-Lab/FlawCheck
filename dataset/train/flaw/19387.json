{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which President Trump \"blew up\" the deal. It is stated that the president turned down a bill that included $25 billion for border security, but it does not provide specific details on why or how the deal was \"blown up.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that President Trump blew up the deal. It only mentions that a bill was introduced and debated, but does not provide any further information on the outcome or reasons for the deal not being accepted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump turning down the deal is solely responsible for the current disagreement and government shutdown over funding for the border wall. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the impasse.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the deal was not accepted by President Trump. It does not explore other possible reasons or factors that may have contributed to the rejection of the bill."}
