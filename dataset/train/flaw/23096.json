{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the nomination made by a Norwegian member of parliament, but the names of nominees and nominators are not publicly revealed by the Nobel Foundation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is a definitive endorsement of the Black Lives Matter movement's peaceful efforts, which may be a problematic assumption as the nomination does not guarantee the movement's overall impact or effectiveness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the nomination, such as political motivations or a desire to raise awareness about racial injustice, which are not explicitly mentioned in the claim."}
