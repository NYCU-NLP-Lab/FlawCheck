{"Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support for expanded background checks within the NRA leadership in 1999. The expert's verdict mentions that the NRA leadership at the time did support some form of background checks, but the claim only states that they were \"pretty much the same people intact\" without providing further details.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully substantiate the assertion that the NRA leadership in Washington was for expanded background checks in 1999. The expert's verdict provides some context and quotes from that time, but it is not comprehensive enough to definitively prove the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current NRA leadership's stance on expanded background checks is different from the past, without providing specific evidence or reasoning for this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that the NRA still challenges certain aspects of background checks, suggesting that their stance may not have drastically changed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative explanations for any perceived change in the NRA leadership's stance on expanded background checks. The expert's verdict mentions that the NRA had concerns with specific provisions in the 1999 proposals and that the recent legislation also faced opposition from the NRA due to certain aspects."}
