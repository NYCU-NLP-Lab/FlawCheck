{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama \"didn't deliver jack squat on any of it\" regarding the promise of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Obama did take action on immigration reform, such as supporting the DREAM Act.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Obama did not deliver on his promise. The expert's verdict provides evidence of Obama's actions and efforts towards immigration reform.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's promise of a pathway to citizenship was not fulfilled without considering the challenges and obstacles faced in passing comprehensive immigration reform, such as Republican opposition and filibuster.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Obama may not have been able to fully deliver on his promise, such as political obstacles and opposition. The expert's verdict provides context on the challenges faced by Obama in passing immigration reform."}
