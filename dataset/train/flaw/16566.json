{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in homicides by stating it as the largest increase in 25 years, without providing enough evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in homicides is solely attributed to the year 2015 without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in homicides, such as changes in reporting methods or population growth in the cities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact-checking analysis which found that the increase in homicides was 16 percent, not 17 percent as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in homicides by not considering the excluded cities that did not submit data, potentially leading to a higher percentage increase.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on preliminary figures and projections rather than using full-year FBI crime data for 2015."}
