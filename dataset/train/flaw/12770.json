{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the danger of CFLs releasing dangerous amounts of mercury when broken. The expert's verdict states that the amount of mercury contained in one CFL bulb is very small and poses a minimal danger if the bulb is not broken open.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential danger of mercury escaping from broken CFL bulbs. The expert's verdict acknowledges that mercury vapor and mercury-containing phosphor powder can be difficult to contain and recommends a careful clean-up process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that energy-saving light bulbs release dangerous amounts of mercury when broken. The expert's verdict provides more nuanced information about the amount of mercury in CFL bulbs and the recommended clean-up process.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that CFLs release dangerous amounts of mercury when broken without providing evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict provides a more balanced view, acknowledging the presence of mercury in CFL bulbs but also highlighting the small amount and the importance of proper handling.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the potential danger of mercury release from broken CFL bulbs. The expert's verdict, however, suggests alternative solutions such as proper clean-up and disposal methods to mitigate any potential harm."}
