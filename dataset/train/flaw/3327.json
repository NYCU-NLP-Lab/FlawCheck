{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the tax increase by stating that it would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year, without providing enough evidence or context to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Tammy Baldwin supports a tax increase that would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Baldwin's aim was to extend tax cuts for the middle class, not raise taxes on them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tammy Baldwin's support for a compromise on tax cuts equates to supporting a tax increase for the middle class, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Tammy Baldwin's position on tax cuts, such as her concern for the national debt and fiscal responsibility."}
