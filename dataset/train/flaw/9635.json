{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the beating, as it presents the incident as a case of police brutality towards protesting farmers, without providing enough evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Sikh protestor was beaten by Delhi police during the farmers' protest. The evidence provided includes a deleted tweet, a screenshot of a tweet, and the circulation of an image online, but no concrete evidence or reliable sources are provided to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of the Sikh man with bruises and wounds is a result of him being beaten by Delhi police during the farmers' protest. However, alternative explanations are presented, such as the man being involved in a scuffle with police officers in a different incident in 2019.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the injuries depicted in the image may not be a result of police brutality during the farmers' protest, but rather from a previous incident involving the Sikh man and the police officers."}
