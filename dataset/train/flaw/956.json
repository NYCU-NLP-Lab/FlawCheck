{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Justice Antonin Scalia agreeing to hear a case about Barack Obama's eligibility to be President. The expert's verdict mentions that there is overwhelming evidence that Obama is a natural born citizen and eligible to be President, suggesting that the claim is exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a chain email and a forged article. The expert's verdict mentions that the article in question is not legitimate and the information in the chain email is unreliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Justice Antonin Scalia's agreement to hear the case indicates doubt or controversy regarding Obama's eligibility. However, the expert's verdict explains that the Supreme Court's decision to hear a case requires at least four justices in favor, and it does not necessarily indicate doubt or controversy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents one explanation for Justice Scalia agreeing to hear the case, suggesting doubts about Obama's eligibility. However, the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that Justice Thomas submitted the case to committee, which does not necessarily imply support for hearing the case."}
