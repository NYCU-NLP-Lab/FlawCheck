{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the viewership numbers of the Republican National Convention (RNC) compared to the Democratic National Convention (DNC). The actual viewership numbers provided by Nielsen are much lower than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The author of the claim did not provide any source to back up the viewership numbers they stated. USA TODAY could find no evidence supporting the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that multiplying the viewership of the DNC by six (to mirror the C-SPAN streaming numbers) would accurately represent the viewership of the RNC. This assumption is not supported by evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no TV program has ever hit 128 million viewers nationwide. The viewership numbers provided by Nielsen for both conventions are significantly lower than the claimed number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in viewership numbers, such as the timing of the conventions (RNC being held the week after DNC) and the availability of streaming options.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
