{"Lack enough support": "The claim of cutting homelessness among veterans by a third is supported by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, which states that there has been a 33 percent decrease since 2010. However, it is not clear if this decrease can be solely attributed to the efforts of the Obama Administration or if it is part of a larger national economic recovery.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in homelessness among veterans is solely due to the actions taken by the Obama Administration. It does not consider other factors such as the national economic recovery or the efforts of other organizations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The decrease in homelessness among veterans could potentially be attributed to the larger national economic recovery rather than the specific actions taken by the Obama Administration. The claim does not address this alternative explanation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the factors contributing to the decrease in homelessness among veterans. It focuses solely on the efforts of the Obama Administration without considering other potential factors.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the efforts made by the Obama Administration in addressing homelessness among veterans. It does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific policies and programs implemented by the administration.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the decrease in homelessness among veterans. It relies on the 33 percent decrease reported by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. It is based on the reported decrease in homelessness among veterans as documented by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development."}
