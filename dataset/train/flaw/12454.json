{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which immigrant households receive benefits from the social welfare system. While the claim states that \"half of all immigrant households receive benefits,\" the expert's verdict clarifies that it is actually 51 percent of immigrant-headed households that reported using at least one welfare program in 2012.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high percentage of immigrant households receiving benefits is solely due to the immigration status of the household head. However, the expert's verdict explains that in many cases, it is actually U.S.-born children in these households who are eligible for the welfare programs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a single study from the Center for Immigration Studies, which is a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. While the study provides data on the percentage of immigrant-headed households using welfare programs, it may be argued that more research is needed to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of immigrant-headed households using welfare programs. It does not take into account factors such as socioeconomic status, education levels, or other demographic variables that may influence the likelihood of using welfare programs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is a 1996 law restricting immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a \"qualified alien.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the majority of authorized immigrants have been in the country for more than five years, indicating that this law has only a modest impact on the share of immigrant households receiving benefits."}
