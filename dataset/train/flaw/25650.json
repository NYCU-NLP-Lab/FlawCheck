{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Iran's non-compliance with their obligations, as the IAEA report suggests that Iran has not provided enough information for the agency to clarify outstanding questions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence from the IAEA report to back up the assertion that Iran is not currently living up to their obligations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the IAEA's statement about Iran not currently living up to their obligations is a clear indication of Iran's lack of compliance, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Iran's non-compliance, such as technical difficulties or misunderstandings, which are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the IAEA report states that Iran's declared nuclear material and activities are peaceful and in accordance with safeguard agreements, but there are concerns about undisclosed activities and undeclared material.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the IAEA's statement by not providing the full context of the report's findings and focusing solely on Iran's non-compliance."}
