{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no consensus on the methodology or definitions used to research the number of deaths caused by lack of access to affordable healthcare, indicating a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict states that terrorist attacks and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants account for a relatively small portion of all violent deaths in the United States, suggesting that the claim may be understating the impact of these factors.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict mentions that terrorist attacks are relatively rare events in the United States and have resulted in a small number of fatalities, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerating the impact of terrorism compared to lack of affordable healthcare.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the victims of terrorist acts are typically not individually targeted in advance and are either arbitrary or part of a symbolically targeted group. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the deaths caused by terrorist attacks, which could challenge the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that no consensus exists on the number of deaths caused by lack of access to affordable healthcare. This contradicts the claim's assertion that lack of affordable healthcare accounts for a greater number of deaths than terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined."}
