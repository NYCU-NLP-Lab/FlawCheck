{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of revoking the Keystone pipeline permit by stating that Biden is \"destroying\" 11,000 jobs. The actual number of jobs at risk is estimated to be around 1,000, and most of these jobs would be temporary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs. The estimate of 11,000 jobs is based on projections by TC Energy, the company behind the pipeline, and there is no concrete data or analysis provided to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that revoking the Keystone pipeline permit directly leads to the destruction of 11,000 jobs. However, it fails to consider alternative explanations or factors that could impact job numbers, such as the temporary nature of many of the jobs and the overall viability of the project.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that revoking the Keystone pipeline permit will destroy 11,000 jobs. The expert's verdict highlights that the pipeline project was already effectively halted without support from the U.S. government, and only a small section of the pipeline had been completed before Biden's executive order.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential economic impact of revoking the Keystone pipeline permit. While the claim focuses on the job losses, it does not mention any potential benefits or considerations that led to the decision, such as environmental concerns or the potential for job creation in alternative energy sectors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden's executive order revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, halting its construction in the U.S. The claim implies that Biden is solely responsible for destroying the jobs, while in reality, the project was already facing challenges and uncertainties.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a one-sided perspective and failing to provide a comprehensive analysis of the situation. It focuses solely on the job losses without considering other factors or potential benefits associated with revoking the permit."}
