{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount that American taxpayers paid under the Trump administration's tax law by stating it was over $90 billion more than the previous year. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate figure of about $93 billion more.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement that American taxpayers paid over $90 billion more. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides data and figures from the IRS to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in tax payments under the Trump administration's tax law is a negative outcome for American taxpayers. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in tax payments, such as changes in the economy or other factors. The expert's verdict mentions that it is too early to determine the long-term effects of the tax law.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the IRS collected about $93 billion more from individual American taxpayers in 2018 compared to 2017, as reported by Yahoo! Finance and confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times since it only provides a single statement without further context or evidence."}
