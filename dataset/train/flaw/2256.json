{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the number of countries that do not guarantee health care to all people as a right, as there are at least two other major countries (Mexico and Australia) mentioned in the expert's verdict that also lack universal health care coverage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the United States is the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that guaranteeing health care as a right is the only valid approach, without considering alternative methods or systems used by other countries to achieve similar results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations by highlighting different approaches to health care in various countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Australia, and Japan."}
