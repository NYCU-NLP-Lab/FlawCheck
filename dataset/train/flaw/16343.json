{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerating the impact of COVID-19 in North Dakota by stating that one out of every 800 residents had died from the virus. This is because the actual figure provided by the North Dakota Department of Health is 954 deaths out of a population of roughly 762,000, which is slightly higher than the claim suggests.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by the figures provided by the North Dakota Department of Health and other sources, which state that there have been 954 deaths out of a population of roughly 762,000. Therefore, there is sufficient support for the claim and no bias in terms of lack of support.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption present in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias in the claim as it simply presents the number of COVID-19 deaths in North Dakota without providing any alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times. The figures provided are consistent and accurate."}
