{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which liberal groups were investigated by the IRS. The expert's verdict suggests that while some liberal groups were indeed investigated, it is unclear if they were investigated to the same extent as conservative groups.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the focus and targeting of conservative groups by the IRS. The expert's verdict indicates that there was a specific focus on tea party groups and that they were subjected to greater scrutiny.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the IRS was \"basically looking at everybody.\" The expert's verdict highlights the investigation conducted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, but it does not provide conclusive evidence that all groups were equally targeted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the IRS's investigation of liberal groups was equivalent to the targeting and scrutiny faced by conservative groups. The expert's verdict suggests that the targeting of conservative groups was more pronounced and specific.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the IRS's investigation of liberal groups was a response to the scrutiny faced by conservative groups. The expert's verdict does not provide information on the motivations behind the IRS's investigation of liberal groups."}
