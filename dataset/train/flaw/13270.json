{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may understate the level of spillover violence in Texas. This is evident from the evidence provided by the expert, including the murder of a pregnant American consulate worker and her husband in Ciudad Juarez, the warnings issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety, and the closure of universities due to stray bullets from a shootout.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict indicates that the claim falters at times. This is evident from Senator Cornyn's initial backpedaling during a press conference when asked for evidence of spillover violence. He initially stated that there had not been spillover violence in Texas, but later clarified that there have been instances of spillover violence occurring along the border.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may lack enough support. While the expert provides evidence such as news articles and editorials reporting incidents that could indicate spillover violence, it is unclear if this evidence is sufficient to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention an alternative explanation to the claim. However, the evidence provided by the expert, such as the Mexican military helicopter sighting and the inflow of Mexicans seeking political asylum, could suggest alternative explanations for the violence observed in Texas."}
