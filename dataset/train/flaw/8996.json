{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of 11 years without major hurricanes striking land in the United States, suggesting it completely undermines the argument for climate change.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of major hurricanes for 11 years is enough evidence to disprove the argument for climate change, without considering other factors or data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up its assertion that the absence of major hurricanes for 11 years contradicts the climate change argument.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by ignoring the fact that Hurricane Matthew, a Category 4 storm, was approaching the east coast of Florida at the time the statement was made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the absence of major hurricanes, such as natural climate variability or other factors that may affect hurricane patterns."}
