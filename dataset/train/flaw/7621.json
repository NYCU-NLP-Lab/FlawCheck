{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that police are \"20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of officers killed in the line of duty is directly comparable to the number of people killed by police, which may not be an accurate or relevant comparison.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 48 law enforcement officials were killed by criminal acts in 2019, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's statistics.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of officers killed in the line of duty by only focusing on the \"felonious\" deaths and not considering accidental deaths or deaths from other causes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the number of people killed by police, such as the circumstances of the encounters or other demographic factors, that are not addressed in the claim."}
