{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the tax breaks by stating that they will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the $2.3 billion cost estimate. It only refers to a memo by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which is not sufficient to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tax breaks for corporations and the rich are inherently negative, without providing a clear argument or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tax breaks, such as potential economic benefits or job creation that may result from attracting corporations and wealthy individuals to the state."}
