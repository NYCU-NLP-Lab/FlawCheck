{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the health care bill by stating that it will \"let insurance companies charge five times more for people over 50.\" While the bill does allow for a higher rate banding of 5-to-1 for older adults, it fails to mention that insurers can already charge older adults up to three times as much under current law.", "Understate": "The claim understates the current premium differences between older and younger adults. It fails to mention that before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five times higher than those charged to younger adults.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its statement about the health care bill. It does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the claim that the bill will lead to skyrocketing costs for older consumers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the health care bill will make coverage completely unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions. However, it does not provide any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the provisions in the health care bill. It does not explore the potential reasons behind the 5-to-1 rate banding for older adults or any potential benefits or trade-offs associated with this provision."}
