{"Understate": "The claim may understate the efforts made by the United States and China to address cybersecurity, as there was a subsequent agreement between the two countries that dealt directly with cybersecurity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that none of the 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that because cybersecurity was not explicitly mentioned in the 100-plus points of agreement, it was not addressed at all, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that cybersecurity discussions may have been covered within the 127-point list by point 4, which confirmed the existence of \"candid, constructive discussions between the two sides on strategic security issues.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was a subsequent agreement on cybersecurity between the United States and China announced in September, which undermines the argument made by the claim."}
