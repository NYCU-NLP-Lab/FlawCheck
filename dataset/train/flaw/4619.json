{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of deaths by only including daily deaths directly linked to a specific event resulting in mass fatality, while leaving out the number of deaths from all causes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not consider daily deaths not linked to a specific cause and omits some historical events that resulted in greater numbers of fatalities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused four of the eight deadliest days in American history based on a specific criteria, which may not be comprehensive or representative of overall death tolls.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or events, such as the 1918 flu pandemic, which had a significantly higher death toll than the events listed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that daily death totals from the COVID-19 pandemic have surpassed those of events like Pearl Harbor and 9/11, which are memorialized as national tragedies.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic by presenting it as one of the deadliest events modern Americans have ever grappled with, without considering other historical events with higher death tolls."}
