{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in arrest and conviction rates between people of color and others by stating that people of color are \"three times more likely\" to be arrested and convicted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that people of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted for marijuana use.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in arrest and conviction rates is solely due to racial bias, without considering other factors that may contribute to the disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the disparity in arrest and conviction rates, such as differences in law enforcement practices or socio-economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Black and white people use marijuana at similar rates, as supported by the 2018 national survey on drug use mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of racial disparity in marijuana-related arrests by only focusing on the three times more likely statistic. The expert's verdict mentions that Black people in Virginia were 3.5 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana, and nationally, Black people were 3.6 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the racial disparities in marijuana-related arrests by not considering other factors or providing additional evidence to support the claim."}
