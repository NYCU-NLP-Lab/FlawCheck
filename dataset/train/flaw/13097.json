{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Wisconsin's concealed-carry permit rules demand more proof than other states, without providing evidence or comparison to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that \"all existing (training) certificates\" are insufficient as part of the permit application.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why Wisconsin's Department of Justice may have required specific information on training certificates, such as ensuring the requirements of the concealed weapons law are met."}
