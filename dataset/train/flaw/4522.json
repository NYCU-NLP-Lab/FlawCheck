{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants is based on a letter from lawyers for the Conservative Renewal PAC, but there is no other evidence provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that signing an ACORN pledge is equivalent to promising to make the city a sanctuary, without providing further evidence or explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert questions how the Conservative Renewal PAC concluded that Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the ACORN pledge.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing sufficient evidence or explanation to support the assertion that Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim by explaining that the concept of sanctuary cities has evolved and that it refers to communities that do not routinely identify and detain illegal immigrants, rather than actively providing sanctuary.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents a strong and definitive statement about Leppert's pledge without providing strong evidence to support it.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
