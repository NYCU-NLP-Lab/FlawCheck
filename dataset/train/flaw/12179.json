{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the issue by stating that it is legal for police officers to have sex with unconsenting detainees in 35 states, when in fact, it is not explicitly illegal in those states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or references to laws in each of the 35 states to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a detainee might feel obliged to \"consent\" to sex in order to avoid being arrested or detained, even on false charges, but it does not provide concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the issue, such as cultural or societal norms, power dynamics, or the specific circumstances of individual cases."}
