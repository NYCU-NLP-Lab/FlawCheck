{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that a Hong Kong celebrity visited a fellow actor in the hospital in 2021. The provided information includes a video, screenshots, and news articles, but none of them directly confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video and accompanying text accurately depict a visit by Stephen Chow to Ng Man-tat in the hospital. However, there is no concrete evidence or confirmation from reliable sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the video and screenshots might not be related to a hospital visit. The photos from the Hong Kong China News Agency (CNA) suggest that Stephen Chow was leaving the High Court after testifying in court, which contradicts the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ng Man-tat had already passed away from cancer in a Hong Kong hospital on the same day the video circulated. Therefore, it is unlikely that Stephen Chow could have visited him in the hospital.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the significance or impact of the video, as it states that the video has been viewed more than 6,000 times on Twitter alone, and tens of thousands of views on Facebook and Weibo. This suggests a higher level of attention and interest than conveyed by the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it simply states that a Hong Kong celebrity visited a fellow actor in the hospital. However, without sufficient evidence to support the claim, it is difficult to determine if any exaggeration exists.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and verifiable account of the alleged hospital visit. The information provided includes various sources, screenshots, and news articles, but they do not conclusively prove that the visit took place."}
