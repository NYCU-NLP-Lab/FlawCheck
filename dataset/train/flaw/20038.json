{"Exaggeration": "The claim states that 12 churches were targeted in France over seven days, which is an exaggeration. The incidents described in the article actually comprise eight acts of vandalism at six churches over a span of more than seven weeks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 12 churches were vandalized in one week. The Breitbart article and its sources did not document such a specific timeframe or provide enough details about the incidents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incidents occurred over a longer period of time, rather than within a single week."}
