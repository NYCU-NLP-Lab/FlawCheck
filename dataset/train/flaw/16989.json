{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Tony Evers' involvement in allowing the teacher to keep teaching students. The expert's verdict mentions that Evers had the power to revoke the teacher's teaching license, but it does not provide evidence that Evers actively allowed the teacher to continue teaching.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough evidence or support to fully substantiate the accusation against Tony Evers. The expert's verdict mentions that the teacher's firing was ruled improper and that the decision was upheld by two courts, suggesting that there were legal processes involved in the teacher's reinstatement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tony Evers had the power to prevent the teacher from teaching anywhere in the state by revoking his teaching license. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the law regarding revoking a teacher's license for \"immoral behavior\" was changed, in part, because of this case. This suggests that the claim's assumption may not align with the current legal framework.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the teacher was allowed to keep teaching students. The expert's verdict mentions that the teacher's firing was ruled improper and that the decision was upheld by two courts, indicating that there may have been legal reasons for the teacher's reinstatement."}
