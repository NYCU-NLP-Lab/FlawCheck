{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Berkeley public schools were fully integrated in 1968, while the claim suggests they were not integrated when Kamala Harris attended in 1970.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on high school yearbooks from 1963 and 1964, which do not provide evidence for the integration status of the entire school district.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the integration of the high school implies the integration of the entire school district, which is not the case according to the report commissioned by the school board.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that while the high school was integrated, the elementary schools in the district were effectively segregated due to neighborhood demographics.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the integration process by simplifying it to a single tweet and yearbook pictures, without considering the historical context and official reports on the matter."}
