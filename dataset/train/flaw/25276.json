{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Barack Obama's plan gives a driver's license to any illegal immigrant who wants one. This is an overstatement of Obama's position on the issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or specific plan mentioned on Obama's website that supports the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's statements during the debates regarding driver's licenses for illegal immigrants translate into a concrete plan to provide licenses to any illegal immigrant who wants one. This assumption is problematic as Obama's statements indicate a focus on public safety and comprehensive immigration reform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that Obama's statements about driver's licenses for illegal immigrants were made in the context of discussing public safety and comprehensive immigration reform, rather than advocating for granting licenses to any illegal immigrant who wants one.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama's immigration plan, as stated on his website, does not mention anything about driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Obama's stance on driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, as his statements in the debates indicate a nuanced approach that considers public safety and comprehensive immigration reform."}
