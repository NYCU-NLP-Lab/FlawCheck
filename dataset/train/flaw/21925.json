{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that there is \"not much evidence\" to suggest that people have contributed to global warming or can do much to change it, which contradicts the scientific consensus on human impact on climate change.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any scientific evidence or references to back up the assertion that there is not much evidence for human contribution to global warming.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that scientists disagree on the extent of human contribution to global warming, which contradicts the scientific consensus on the subject.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation supported by scientific consensus, which is that human activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions, are the primary cause of global warming."}
