{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Floridians who will lose their coverage through Obamacare, stating that over half a million people will be affected. The actual number reported by Bloomberg News is more than 400,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight and doesn't work. The expert's verdict provides information about insurance companies withdrawing from the marketplace, but it does not conclusively prove that the entire system is failing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the loss of coverage, such as insurance companies choosing to withdraw from the marketplace due to financial losses. The expert mentions that Rubio's actions may have contributed to insurers leaving the marketplace, suggesting there are other factors at play.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of Floridians losing their coverage by not fully addressing the potential consequences of switching insurers. The expert mentions that some individuals may experience changes or potentially worse and more expensive coverage, but the extent of these impacts is not fully known.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Floridians will not be left uninsured but will have to switch to new insurers. The expert clarifies that the coverage loss is not equivalent to being uninsured, as individuals will still have coverage, albeit with a different plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loss of coverage is solely due to Obamacare's failure, without considering other factors such as insurance companies' financial losses or decisions to withdraw from the marketplace.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a one-sided perspective without acknowledging the complexities and nuances of the situation. It fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the loss of coverage and the potential outcomes for those affected."}
