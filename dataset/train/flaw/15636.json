{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the majority of revenue would be sent to the Seminole tribe in Florida. The expert's analysis indicates that the claim is not entirely accurate and that the money would be sent out of state, not just to Florida.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the majority of revenue generated by the casino would be sent to the Seminole tribe in Florida. The expert's analysis also highlights the lack of evidence provided by the group making the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of revenue would be sent to the Seminole tribe in Florida without providing any clear basis or justification for this assumption. The expert's analysis questions the validity of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for where the revenue generated by the casino would go. The expert's analysis suggests that the money would be sent out of state, but not necessarily just to the Seminole tribe in Florida."}
