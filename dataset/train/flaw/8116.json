The expert's verdict mentions that the group NumbersUSA provided assumptions and calculations to estimate the number of relatives that can be brought in, but there is no mention of specific cases or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may be seen as making a problematic assumption that all eligible family members of an immigrant would leave for the U.S. and become citizens as soon as they legally can. The expert's verdict mentions that the group NumbersUSA's estimate is based on assumptions such as fertility rates and the assumption that all eligible family members would immigrate and become citizens.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may be seen as not considering alternative explanations or factors that could affect the number of relatives that can be brought in by one person with a green card. The expert's verdict mentions that the group NumbersUSA's estimate does not take into account visa processing waits or immigration backlogs, which could impact the actual number of relatives that can be brought in."}
