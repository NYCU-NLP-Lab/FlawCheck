{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the second Broward County sheriff's deputy died suspiciously after \"exposing\" the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, when in fact there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that the deputy's death was suspicious or related to exposing the school shooting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting a connection between the deputy's death and the school shooting without any evidence or official confirmation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for the deputies' deaths, pointing to the possibility of suicide rather than a mysterious plot or suspicious circumstances.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that local officials have not deemed either deputy's death as suspicious or linked to the school shooting.", "Understate": "The claim understates the cause of death by implying a suspicious connection, when the expert suggests that suicide is a more likely explanation based on the lack of stated causes of death and common euphemistic language used.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making unsupported assertions and failing to provide accurate information about the deputies' deaths and their connection to the school shooting."}
