{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict exaggerates the destructive power of earthquakes by describing them as \"among the most fearsome natural disasters known to the planet\" and stating that they can \"bring thousands of lives to an end\" and cause \"devastating amounts of destruction.\"", "Understate": "The expert's verdict understates the correlation between hot and dry weather and earthquakes by stating that \"a number of major quakes have occurred when the weather was hot and dry,\" implying that there is some correlation, even though they later state that there is no correlation.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict lacks enough support for the claim that earthquakes are most likely to happen when the weather is hot and dry. They mention that there is no clear agreement on this belief and provide conflicting views on what constitutes \"earthquake weather.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict makes a problematic assumption that earthquakes occur without warning, implying that the lack of advance notice makes them more terrifying. While earthquakes can occur suddenly, there are often warning signs and monitoring systems in place to detect seismic activity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the belief in \"earthquake weather,\" stating that earthquakes are caused by tectonic plate movements and not influenced by weather conditions."}
