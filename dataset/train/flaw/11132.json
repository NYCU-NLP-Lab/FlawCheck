{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of global warming on the evaporation of the Great Lakes. While global warming can contribute to changes in water levels, it may not be the sole or primary factor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or scientific data to support the direct link between global warming and the recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider other potential factors that could contribute to the low water levels, such as dredging, erosion, and diversion, which have been known to affect the baseline level of the lake.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not acknowledging the historical fluctuations in water levels and the existence of both seasonal and longer-term cycles that have occurred since the end of the Ice Age.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan are solely caused by global warming, without considering other natural or human-induced factors that could be influencing the water levels.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the role of factors like dredging, erosion, and diversion in contributing to the current low water levels, as these have been shown to have an impact on the baseline level of the lake.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Lake Michigan experienced lower water levels in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918, which is a verifiable event."}
