{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Emma Gonz\u00e1lez admitted to bullying the former student who later committed the Parkland mass shooting. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that this is a problematic assumption and that the claim is based on conspiracy theories and disinformation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Emma Gonz\u00e1lez admitted to bullying the shooter. The expert's verdict mentions that conservative blogs and right-leaning magazines circulated a brief clip taken from her remarks, but this clip does not provide enough support for the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had alerted officials about concerns regarding the shooter's behavior and were not ostracizing him out of spite, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that the shooter had a history of threatening online, attacking a student, and posting racist and homophobic thoughts. This alternative explanation suggests that the shooter's actions were not solely a result of bullying by Emma Gonz\u00e1lez.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the importance of other factors contributing to the shooter's actions, such as the failure of authorities to act upon reports concerning the suspect and the presence of mental health issues.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively focusing on a brief clip from Emma Gonz\u00e1lez's remarks and ignoring the broader context and evidence presented in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the role of bullying by Emma Gonz\u00e1lez in the shooter's actions, as the expert's verdict provides evidence of other significant factors contributing to the shooting."}
