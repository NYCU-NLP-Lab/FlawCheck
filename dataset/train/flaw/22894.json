{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of women filling minimum wage jobs. The expert's verdict states that women represent close to but not quite two-thirds (62.7 percent) of minimum wage workers, which is slightly lower than the claim's assertion of two-thirds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that women fill two-thirds of minimum wage jobs. The expert's verdict mentions a report by the National Women's Law Center, but it does not provide a direct link or detailed analysis of the report's findings.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Hillary Clinton may falter at times. It highlights that only 59 percent of workers making the federal minimum wage are women, as some workers, like those who earn tips, can legally be paid a lower wage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of women in minimum wage jobs is a result of discrimination or unfair treatment by employers. However, the expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict raises the question of who will benefit if the minimum wage is increased, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the high percentage of women in minimum wage jobs."}
