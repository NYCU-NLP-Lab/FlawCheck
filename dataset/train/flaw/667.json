The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis to support or refute this claim, so it is difficult to determine the level of understatement.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence or analysis to support or refute the claim. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that children born today will carry a specific share of the national debt without providing any context or explanation for how this calculation is made. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not present any alternative explanations for the claim."}
