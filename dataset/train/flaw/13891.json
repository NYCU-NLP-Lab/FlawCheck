{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of people crossing the border who are \"non-impactable\" by stating that \"more than half\" fall into this category. This may not be an accurate representation of the actual numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"more than half the people crossing the border are non-impactable.\" It is unclear where this information is derived from.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a border wall would have no impact on the \"non-impactable\" individuals crossing the border. This assumption may not be entirely accurate as the effectiveness of a border wall in deterring or handling different types of border crossers is a complex issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the number of \"non-impactable\" individuals crossing the border, such as the root causes of migration or the effectiveness of alternative border security measures."}
