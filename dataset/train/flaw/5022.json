Chris Christie's administration by stating that spending is lower than it was in fiscal year 2008, without acknowledging the subsequent increases in each new state budget since he took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the statement that state spending is lower today than it was in fiscal year 2008. It only provides limited information about the budgets approved by Gov. Christie without considering other factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reducing government spending is the only way to make New Jersey a more affordable place to live, without considering other potential solutions or factors that contribute to the cost of living.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decrease in state spending, such as changes in economic conditions or shifts in budget priorities."}
