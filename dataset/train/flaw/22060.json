{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential danger of ingesting hand sanitizer, as it states that such poisonings are rare due to the relatively large amount of sanitizer that a toddler would have to ingest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or statistics to support the statement that ingestion of hand sanitizer by children can result in alcohol poisoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the symptoms experienced by the child, such as the possibility of another substance being ingested or a pre-existing medical condition.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that hand sanitizers contain enough alcohol that, if ingested, could possibly lead to alcohol poisoning.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the immediate effects of ingesting hand sanitizer, as it describes the child becoming \"all glassy eyed and wobbly in her feet\" within approximately 10 minutes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the hand sanitizer was the sole cause of the child's symptoms and blood alcohol level, without considering other potential factors or interactions with medications.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by including personal anecdotes and emotional language, which may undermine its credibility as a factual statement."}
