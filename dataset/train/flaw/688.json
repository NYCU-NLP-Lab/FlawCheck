{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of opposition to hunting among New Jersey voters by stating that \"99% of NJ voters do NOT support hunting.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence from surveys that show a significant percentage of respondents either supporting or being unsure about hunting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that 99% of NJ voters do not support hunting. The expert's verdict presents survey results that show a more nuanced view among New Jersey voters, with a significant percentage supporting hunting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Bear Education and Resource Group's website accurately represents the views of all New Jersey voters. The expert's verdict highlights the website's claim without providing additional evidence or context to support it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the Bear Education and Resource Group's claim and the survey results. The expert's verdict provides insights into different factors that can influence opinions on hunting, such as gender and location.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the survey results presented in the expert's verdict, which show that a significant percentage of New Jersey voters either support or are unsure about hunting.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a sweeping statement about the opinions of all New Jersey voters without providing comprehensive evidence or considering the nuances of public opinion on hunting."}
