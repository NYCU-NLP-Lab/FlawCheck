{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the video promoting Trump's reelection campaign was banned by both Facebook and YouTube. The expert's verdict confirms that there is no evidence of the video being banned or suppressed on either platform.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that the video was banned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is an official campaign advertisement, while the expert's verdict states that it is an unofficial fan video.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video remains live on both Facebook and YouTube and has been widely viewed, as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the video may have been removed for violating platform policies, as Facebook did remove campaign ads by Trump and Pence in the past for policy violations. However, this alternative explanation is not directly mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
