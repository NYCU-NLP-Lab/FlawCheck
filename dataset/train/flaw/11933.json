{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the similarity between President Jimmy Carter's ban on Iranian nationals and Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims. The expert's verdict clarifies that Carter's sanctions were equivalent to Trump's suggestion, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that they were similar in manner.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a strong connection between Carter's ban on Iranian nationals and Trump's proposal to ban Muslims. The expert's verdict mentions that several websites made the comparison, but it does not provide additional evidence or analysis to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Jimmy Carter's ban on Iranian nationals during the Iran Hostage Crisis is directly comparable to Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims. This assumption may be problematic as the contexts and motivations behind these actions are different.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the expert's verdict mentions that the comparison between Carter's ban and Trump's proposal primarily spread among people who favored Trump's restrictions on Muslim immigration. This suggests that the claim may be driven by a bias in favor of Trump's policies rather than a genuine comparison of the two actions."}
