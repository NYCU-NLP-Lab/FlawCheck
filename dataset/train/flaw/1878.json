{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Obama's statement by implying that he specifically called Medicaid \"broken.\" Obama's statement suggests that adding more people to Medicaid without cost controls and reforms would be putting more people into a broken system, but it does not explicitly label Medicaid as \"broken.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Obama called Medicaid \"broken.\" The provided evidence includes a quote from Obama's speech, but it does not directly state that Medicaid is \"broken.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's statement about not putting more people into a broken system refers specifically to Medicaid. It is possible that Obama was referring to the healthcare system as a whole and not solely Medicaid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Obama was highlighting the need for cost controls and reforms in the healthcare system, rather than specifically criticizing Medicaid as \"broken.\" This interpretation aligns with the context provided in the expert's verdict."}
