{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of the infrastructure bill during the Obama administration, stating it was a trillion dollars when it was actually just over $800 billion.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the infrastructure bill, suggesting that \"nobody ever saw anything being built\" when there were actually investments made in various areas including tax cuts, aid to state governments, and safety net expenditures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that \"nobody ever saw anything being built\" as it fails to provide specific evidence or examples.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the infrastructure bill was primarily focused on infrastructure, when in reality it had multiple goals and only a fraction of the funds were intended for infrastructure projects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of funds, such as investments in education, research, and other public investments that fall under the \"public investment\" category."}
