{"Exaggerate": "The claim is exaggerated as it suggests that the flyers promoting an anti-CNN petition were handed out to guests at check-in, while the evidence suggests that it was only given to a person who visited the lobby bar and not to every guest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the flyers were distributed to all guests at check-in.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flyers were distributed by hotel staff, but there is no evidence to support this assumption. The person who received the flyer stated that they did not know who gave it to them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the flyers were not distributed by the hotel staff, but by an anonymous person in the lobby bar.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the hotel spokesperson who denied any knowledge of guests receiving the flyers at check-in.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single Facebook post as the source of the rumor, which has since been deleted or made private.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
