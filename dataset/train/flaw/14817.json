{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"Ninety million Americans either aren\u2019t working or aren\u2019t looking for work\" is exaggerated because it includes individuals who are not expected to be working, such as high school students, college students, and retired individuals.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of people who are of normal working age, not in college, and not working, as the expert's verdict states that this number is less than one-quarter of the cited 90 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all individuals who are not working or looking for work are capable and available for employment, which may not be the case for certain groups such as retired individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim of 90 million Americans not working or looking for work.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the lower number of people joining the workforce may be a cause for concern for economists, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in labor force participation."}
