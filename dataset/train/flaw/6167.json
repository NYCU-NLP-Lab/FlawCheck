{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the Pennsylvania Constitution forbids mail-in voting. The constitution does not explicitly ban mail-in voting, but rather sets specific reasons for absentee voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the new law allowing universal mail-in balloting was passed \"irregardless\" of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the law was passed with strong Republican support and that it aligns with the state constitution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new law conflicts with the state's constitution without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict explains that the courts have not backed up this argument and that the state constitution does not explicitly ban mail-in voting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the passage of the new law, such as bipartisan efforts and the inclusion of priorities from both Republicans and Democrats. The expert's verdict highlights the bipartisan nature of the law and its support from both parties.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the new law allowing mail-in voting was passed in October 2019, not \"last year\" as stated in the claim. This discrepancy undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the timing of the passage of the new law and making misleading statements about the Pennsylvania Constitution's stance on mail-in voting. These inconsistencies weaken the credibility of the claim."}
