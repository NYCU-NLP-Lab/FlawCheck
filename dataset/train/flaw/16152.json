{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the idea of Bush and Cheney being arrested overseas is not entirely far-fetched, but it does not provide concrete examples or evidence of such warrants existing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bush and Cheney have outstanding warrants without providing any proof or specific information about the warrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for why Bush and Cheney may choose not to visit certain countries, such as concerns about protests or negative public opinion, rather than the existence of outstanding warrants."}
