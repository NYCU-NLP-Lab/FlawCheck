{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Rick Scott \"raised property taxes\" may be seen as an exaggeration because it does not accurately reflect the actions taken by Scott regarding property tax rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Rick Scott actually raised property taxes, as the evidence provided suggests that the tax rate remained the same or even decreased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in tax revenue is equivalent to a tax increase, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not take into account other factors such as changes in property values.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the Scott campaign that focuses on the higher tax revenue rather than an actual increase in tax rates."}
