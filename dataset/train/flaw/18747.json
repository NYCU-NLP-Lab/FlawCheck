{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the issue by stating that \"50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level.\" It is possible that the actual percentage of students who cannot read at grade level is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to fully validate the statistic. While the claim provides information about the FCAT results, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all Florida high school students.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inability to read at grade level is solely the result of teachers' impact on student learning. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to students' reading abilities, such as home environments or individual learning differences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the low reading proficiency, such as systemic issues within the education system or socioeconomic factors that may affect students' access to resources and support."}
