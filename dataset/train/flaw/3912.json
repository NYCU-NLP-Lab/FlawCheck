{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Common Core expects English teachers to spend half of their reading instructional time on informational texts. The expert's verdict mentions that there is a 50 percent/50 percent split in grade four, a 45 percent/55 percent split in grade eight, and a 30 percent/70 percent split in grade 12. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the requirement for all grade levels.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time on informational texts. The expert's verdict mentions the introduction and the NAEP framework, but the claim itself does not provide enough support for this requirement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spending at least half of reading instructional time on informational texts is not beneficial for students intellectually. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential benefits of including informational texts in the curriculum.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the emphasis on informational texts in Common Core. The expert's verdict mentions that the standards follow the lead of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and aim to balance the reading of literature with the reading of informational texts. There may be alternative reasons or educational goals behind this emphasis that are not addressed in the claim."}
