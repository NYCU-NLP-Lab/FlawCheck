{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"over 40,000 new jobs in a little over 18 months\" is an exaggeration as the actual job increase is 28,300, well short of the claimed number.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the job growth in Missouri, as it fails to account for the job losses in December 2019 and March 2020.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the actual data shows a job increase of 28,300, not 40,000.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job increase is solely due to the governor's workforce development agenda and initiatives, without considering other factors that may have contributed to job growth in Missouri.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the job growth in Missouri, such as national economic trends or other state-level policies and initiatives."}
