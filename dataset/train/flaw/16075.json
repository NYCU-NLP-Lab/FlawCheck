{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that Biden understated the rate of increase of children arriving in 2021 by more than half. This suggests that there is an exaggeration in the claim.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict also mentions that the increase in children arriving at the border from January to February 2021 was 63%, which is more than double the rate Biden cited. This indicates that there is an understatement in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides specific data from January and February 2021, as well as 2019, to support their analysis. However, it is not clear if there is enough support for the claim overall, as the data provided only covers a specific time period and does not account for other factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in migration in January, February, and March happens every year. While the expert's verdict mentions that migration usually increases month-to-month during this period, it does not explicitly state that it happens every year, suggesting a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in migration at the border is driven by difficult circumstances in migrants' home countries. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase, which are not acknowledged in the claim."}
