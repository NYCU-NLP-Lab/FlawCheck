{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the education funding by calling it a \"historic level.\" It is unclear if this funding level is truly historic or if it is just an increase compared to previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the education funding of $7,176 per student is a historic level. It only mentions the recommendation made by Gov. Rick Scott.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that higher funding for education automatically leads to better outcomes or competitiveness with other countries. This assumption may not be supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in education funding, such as political motivations or pressure from opponents like former Gov. Charlie Crist. The claim does not address these alternative explanations."}
