{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of empty seats by using the term \"hundreds\" without providing concrete evidence or an accurate count.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the empty seats were solely due to a planned protest. The expert's verdict mentions conflicting reports about the permanence of the walkout and whether the delegates retook their seats.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the empty seats were directly caused by the planned protest, without considering alternative explanations such as delegates leaving for dinner or other reasons.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that supporters of Clinton argued that the seats were empty because delegates had left for dinner, suggesting an alternative explanation for the empty seats.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the walkout was a planned protest organized by Bernie Sanders delegates, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
