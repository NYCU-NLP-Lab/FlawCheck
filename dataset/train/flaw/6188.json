{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Democrats forced the troops to sleep on the ground of a parking garage after dragging them to DC for photo ops. The reality is that the troops were relocated from the U.S. Capitol to a parking garage, but it is not clear who specifically was responsible for the decision.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively attribute the decision to Democrats. The expert's verdict mentions that the Capitol Police instructed the National Guard to relocate, but it is unclear if Democrats were directly involved in the decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Democrats were responsible for the troops being forced to sleep in a parking garage. However, the expert's verdict states that members of Congress from both parties offered their personal offices and conference rooms to the troops after they were alerted to the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the Capitol Police instructed the National Guard to relocate. This suggests that it may not have been solely the Democrats' decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that lawmakers from both parties expressed outrage and offered their support to the troops after they were forced to relocate. This contradicts the claim that Democrats forced the troops to sleep in the parking garage.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making sweeping generalizations about Democrats without providing specific evidence or support for their involvement in the decision to relocate the troops.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the conditions in the parking garage by simply stating that the troops were forced to sleep on the ground. The expert's verdict provides more details about the cramped conditions, lack of internet reception, and limited facilities in the parking garage."}
