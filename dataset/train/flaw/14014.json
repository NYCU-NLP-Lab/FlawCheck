{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Mitt Romney has pledged to protect oil companies' record profits and special tax breaks. The expert's verdict mentions that there are no explicit pledges by Romney to continue tax breaks for oil companies, and the claim relies on Romney's criticism of Obama's proposals and his ties to the oil industry.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no explicit pledges by Romney mentioned in the expert's verdict. The claim is based on assumptions and relies on Romney's criticism and ties to the oil industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney has pledged to protect oil companies' record profits and special tax breaks, without providing concrete evidence or explicit pledges to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim relies on Romney's criticism of Obama's proposals and his ties to the oil industry. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Romney's stance on oil companies' profits and tax breaks, such as his general opposition to Obama's policies rather than explicit pledges to protect oil companies."}
