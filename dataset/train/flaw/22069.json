{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that the income of the bottom 90 percent \"didn't budge, or even retreated a little bit\" since 1973, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the expert mentions that they couldn't find an exact data set that fits the wording of the claim. Instead, they found a similar data set that covers a different period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that income levels have not increased for the bottom 90 percent since 1973. However, the expert's analysis shows that income levels have actually risen beyond inflation during that period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim attributes the lack of income growth to the removal of regulation, weakening of labor standards, and slashing taxes, there may be alternative explanations for the income stagnation or retreat of the bottom 90 percent.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that income levels have actually risen beyond inflation during the period in question, as shown by the expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it presents a broad statement without providing specific data or evidence to support it."}
