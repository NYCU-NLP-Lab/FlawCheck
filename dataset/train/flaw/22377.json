{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Margaret Gomez's role in stopping Capital Metro from raising fares for seniors and disabled citizens. While she did make a successful motion to exempt seniors and disabled riders from a fare hike, it is unclear if she was solely responsible for stopping the fare increase altogether.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Margaret Gomez's actions were solely responsible for stopping the fare increase, without considering other factors or individuals involved in the decision-making process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific details to fully support the assertion that Margaret Gomez \"stopped Capital Metro from raising fares for senior and disabled citizens.\" It does not provide additional information about the context, timeline, or other influencing factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Margaret Gomez, as a board member of Capital Metro in 2008, voted in favor of a fare increase plan that would have affected seniors and disabled citizens. This contradicts the claim that she has always been committed to sparing those riders from paying fares.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decision to exempt seniors and disabled riders from the fare increase, such as the influence of other board members, public pressure, or financial considerations. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
