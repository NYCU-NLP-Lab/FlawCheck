{"Understate": "The claim may understate the problem of panhandling by suggesting that only 78 suspects are responsible for almost 400 arrests, potentially minimizing the extent of the issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the same people are panhandling repeatedly.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of arrests is directly proportional to the number of panhandlers, without considering other factors that could contribute to the high number of arrests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high number of arrests, such as law enforcement targeting specific individuals or groups, rather than indicating that the same people are panhandling repeatedly.", "Contradict fact": "Without further evidence, the claim contradicts the fact that almost 400 arrests involved just 78 suspects, suggesting that each suspect was arrested multiple times, which may not be accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the issue of panhandling by implying that a small number of individuals are responsible for a significant number of arrests, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making broad generalizations about the panhandling problem based on limited data and without considering other possible factors or explanations."}
