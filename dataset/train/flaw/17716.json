{"Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a Wikipedia page as its source, which is open to editing by anyone. However, the Wikipedia page cited in this case had sourced its numbers to a peer-reviewed paper, providing some support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Gini coefficient is the only measure of wealth inequality and that it accurately represents the distribution of wealth in each country. However, there may be other factors and measures that contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of wealth inequality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim attributes the high level of wealth inequality in the United States solely to the actions of Wall Street. While Wall Street's role is mentioned, there may be other factors contributing to wealth inequality that are not addressed in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim states that there are only five countries more unequal than the United States in wealth distribution. This implies that the United States is among the most unequal countries. However, it does not provide information on the extent of the inequality in each of these countries, which may vary significantly.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of wealth inequality in the United States. The data used is about a decade old and does not account for the impact of the 2007 recession and subsequent economic changes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the level of wealth inequality in the United States. It accurately states that there are five countries more unequal than the United States based on the Gini coefficient.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. The expert's verdict confirms that the United States does have the fifth-highest Gini coefficient for wealth in the world."}
