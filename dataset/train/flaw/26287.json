{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the length of the highway, stating it is 880 km long, when it is actually a 240 km section of the Beijing-Kunming highway.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that China has built a specific highway connecting their country with Pakistan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viral video showing the highway is indeed the highway connecting China and Pakistan, without verifying its authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video in question is actually of the Yaxi expressway in Sichuan, China, and not a highway connecting China and Pakistan."}
