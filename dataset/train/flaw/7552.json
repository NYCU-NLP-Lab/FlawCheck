{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Paul Ryan that Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts is seen as a \"grotesque distortion\" by Richard Aboulafia, an expert in the aerospace and defense industry.", "Lack enough support": "The only example provided by Ryan's office is a single instance where spare parts for a B-1 bomber were taken from museum aircraft. This does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that Air Force pilots were consistently going to museums for spare parts.", "Problematic assumption": "Ryan's claim assumes that the lack of funding under Obama directly led to Air Force pilots having to search for spare parts in museums. However, there may be alternative explanations for the practice, such as the cost-saving measure of pulling parts from warehoused planes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The fact check mentions that Air Force maintenance workers have a practice of pulling parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, which has been a cost-saving measure for decades. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the use of spare parts from museums."}
