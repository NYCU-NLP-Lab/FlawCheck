{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photograph shows President Trump posing beside Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The provided evidence suggests that the woman in the photograph is actually a different individual.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph depicts President Trump with Natalia Veselnitskaya based on their shared Russian nationality and some physical features. However, this assumption is problematic as it ignores the evidence that the woman in the photograph is a different person.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the woman in the photograph is not Natalia Veselnitskaya but another individual who shares some physical features with her."}
