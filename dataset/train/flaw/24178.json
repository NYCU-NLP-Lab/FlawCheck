{"Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the significance of the finding of cocaine on the beach. While the claim mentions \"bricks of cocaine,\" the expert's verdict only mentions a single brick and a duffel bag containing 15 kilos of cocaine. This could downplay the actual amount of cocaine that was found.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear if Hurricane Dorian played any part in the drugs washing up on shore. This indicates that there may not be enough evidence to definitively link the cocaine to the hurricane.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the two packages of cocaine found (the brick and the duffel bag) may not be connected. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the presence of the cocaine on the beach.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that a single brick of cocaine was found on a beach in Florida, rather than multiple bricks as mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not consistently address all aspects of the claim. It mentions the finding of cocaine before and after Hurricane Dorian, but it does not directly address the claim that the cocaine washed ashore specifically after the hurricane.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the expert's verdict."}
