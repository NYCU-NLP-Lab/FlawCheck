{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"almost 40% of borrowers with student loan debt didn't finish their degree.\" It is unclear where this statistic comes from or how it was calculated.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that Warren has previously misstated facts about student loans, suggesting that there may be inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not finishing a degree is inherently negative and implies that all borrowers without a degree face negative consequences. However, it does not consider alternative paths or circumstances that may have led to non-completion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual percentage of borrowers who didn't finish their degree if the statistic provided by Huelsman is accurate. The claim uses the phrase \"almost 40%\" but does not provide the exact percentage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why borrowers may not have finished their degree, such as personal circumstances, financial difficulties, or other factors beyond their control.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the provided information does not mention any conflicting evidence. However, without additional context or data, it is difficult to determine if there are any contradictory facts."}
