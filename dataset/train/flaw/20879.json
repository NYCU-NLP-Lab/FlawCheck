The expert's verdict clarifies this timeline and explains that Pelosi's statement included other events and investigations, but not the actual impeachment proceedings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for Pelosi's statement, but the expert's verdict suggests that Pelosi may have included the start of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as part of the impeachment timeline.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing Pelosi's statement and the timeline of the impeachment proceedings.
