{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Clarence Thomas ignored two people who offered to shake his hand in 2021.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clarence Thomas ignored the two people intentionally, without considering any alternative explanations or circumstances.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question was originally published in 2019, not in 2021.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of the incident by emphasizing the race of Clarence Thomas and using provocative language in the translated captions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video's content and context suggest that Clarence Thomas may not have intentionally ignored the individuals, as there is evidence suggesting that the video was taken at a different event where Thomas was not the focus."}
