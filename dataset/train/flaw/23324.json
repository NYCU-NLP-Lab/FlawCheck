{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to confirm whether taking a photograph of a ballot and posting it online is indeed illegal or will invalidate a vote. The expert's verdict mentions that the answer to this question depends on the specific state regulations, which vary widely.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that taking a photograph of a ballot and posting it online is illegal or will invalidate a vote without providing clear evidence or legal references to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the reason for restrictions on photographing ballots is to prevent potential election fraud, rather than solely to invalidate votes or make it illegal.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that regulations regarding voting procedures in the U.S. are set at a state level, indicating that laws differ across states. Therefore, stating that taking a photograph of a ballot and posting it online is universally illegal or will invalidate a vote is not accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential penalties or consequences of taking a photograph of a ballot and posting it online. The expert's verdict mentions that in some states, voters could face criminal penalties for doing so, which suggests that the claim's assertion of illegality or invalidation of votes may be downplayed.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of posting a photograph of a ballot online by stating that it will invalidate a vote. The expert's verdict does not explicitly confirm this consequence, but rather highlights the potential legal risks involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and definitive answer to whether taking a photograph of a ballot and posting it online is illegal or will invalidate a vote. The expert's verdict acknowledges the complexity and variability of state regulations, indicating that the claim's assertion may not hold true in all cases."}
