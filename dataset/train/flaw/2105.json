{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the majority of the candidates on the stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. The expert's verdict mentions that the term \"amnesty\" is vague and that Cruz has been opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but it does not provide specific evidence of the majority of candidates supporting amnesty.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples of the candidates on the stage embracing amnesty. The expert's verdict also mentions that the term \"amnesty\" is vague, making it difficult to determine the extent of support for amnesty among the candidates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting amnesty is a negative position, while the expert's verdict mentions that the term \"amnesty\" can have different interpretations and that some consider it to be a pathway to legal status with certain requirements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the candidates' positions on amnesty. The expert's verdict mentions that the term \"amnesty\" is vague and that Cruz has been opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but it does not explore other possible reasons for the candidates' stances on immigration."}
