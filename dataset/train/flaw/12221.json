{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of military rule in Nigeria by stating that it lasted for 29 out of 60 years of the nation's existence. This could be seen as an exaggeration if the actual duration of military rule is shorter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Nigeria has been under military rule for 29 out of 60 years. It does not provide any specific information or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the years of military rule are cumulative, without providing any explanation or evidence for this assumption. It may be problematic to make this assumption without further clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation mentioned in the expert's verdict for the claim about military rule in Nigeria."}
