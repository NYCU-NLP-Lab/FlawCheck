{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a print advertisement by WD-40 in 1964 that was full of sexual innuendo. The expert points out that there is only one image available on the internet, and there should be more documentation if the ad were genuine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image circulating on the internet is a genuine advertisement from 1964, despite inconsistencies and questionable aspects pointed out by the expert.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that WD-40 was commercially available in San Diego in 1958, eight years before the purported ad's date.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the content of the alleged advertisement by stating that it was \"full of sexual innuendo\" without providing specific evidence or examples.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single image and lacking additional supporting evidence or documentation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert presents alternative explanations for the image, suggesting that it may be a digital overlay or a reused ad copy that has been circulating since 2000."}
