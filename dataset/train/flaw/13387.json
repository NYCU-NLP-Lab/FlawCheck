{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there were \"rumors floating around\" that Chicago police union officials were telling officers not to intervene during Memorial Day weekend. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence and is based on rumors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the existence of the rumors mentioned. It is based on hearsay and speculation rather than concrete facts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements made by city and police union leaders who denied having any knowledge of such instructions given to officers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim made by the mayor, Lori Lightfoot, about the police union pushing for officers not to show up for work and not do their job exaggerates the actual events. The claim implies a broader pattern of behavior that may not be accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable information. It is based on rumors and lacks clear evidence or factual basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in violence over Memorial Day weekend, such as other factors contributing to the spike in crime or the challenges faced by law enforcement in tackling crime in the city."}
