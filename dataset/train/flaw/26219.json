{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single tweet by Newt Gingrich and does not provide any additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gingrich's tweet about a \"California terrorist attack\" was referring to the San Bernardino shooting, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Gingrich's tweet, such as him referring to a different incident or making a general statement about the threat of terrorism in California.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the San Bernardino shooting occurred on 2 December 2015, while Gingrich's tweet was posted on 13 November 2015, several weeks before the shooting.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the tweet by suggesting it didn't garner much attention until after the shooting, when in fact it sparked conspiracy theories and speculation about government involvement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the tweet by implying that it was \"proof positive\" of advance knowledge of the attack, when it could simply be a coincidence or a reference to a different incident.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not directly related to the tweet or the biases, such as the coverage of a 2013 incident on the California power grid."}
