The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the rise of ISIS, such as the actions of the Bush administration and the destabilization caused by the Iraq war.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by ignoring the role of previous administrations and attributing the entire responsibility for the founding of ISIS to President Obama and Secretary Clinton."}
