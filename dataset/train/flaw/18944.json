{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that there have been more suicide deaths than coronavirus deaths in the past two months.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that suicide deaths have surpassed coronavirus deaths without providing substantial evidence or reliable data to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Tom Brady is not supported by accurate and up-to-date information, as experts and researchers have stated that there is no way to confirm such a rapid increase in suicide rates.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the severity and impact of coronavirus deaths by comparing them to suicide deaths without considering the broader context and scale of the pandemic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the available data and expert opinions that suggest coronavirus deaths have been significantly higher than suicide deaths in recent months.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for any potential increase in suicide rates, such as the impact of social isolation or job loss, which may be contributing factors during the pandemic.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim implies that suicide deaths have surpassed coronavirus deaths, it exaggerates the situation without providing substantial evidence or reliable data to support this assertion."}
