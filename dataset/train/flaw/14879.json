{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"tourism employs about 1.6 million people\" is based on available data, but there is no tourism satellite account for Kenya, which is the international standard for measuring tourism's economic value. Accurate estimates are difficult to obtain, indicating a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because the data sources and estimates for tourism's contribution to the Kenyan economy vary. Different reports and plans provide conflicting percentages, ranging from 0.7% to 10%, suggesting inconsistency and potential uncertainty in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people employed in tourism is a direct indicator of its economic value. However, this assumption may be problematic as the economic value of tourism is not solely determined by employment numbers but also by factors such as revenue, investment, and contribution to GDP.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanations for tourism's contribution to the Kenyan economy, as mentioned in the expert's verdict, include conflicting data sources and estimates. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the actual value of tourism in the country, indicating a potential bias in the claim."}
