{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that \"more black babies are aborted in NYC than born.\" While the statistics provided in the expert's verdict support a higher number of abortions among black women in NYC compared to births, it does not necessarily mean that more black babies are aborted than born overall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"more black babies are aborted in NYC than born.\" The expert's verdict provides statistics from a 2013 report, but it does not provide more recent or comprehensive data to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of abortions among black women in NYC is a significant issue that needs attention, without providing a clear context or analysis of the reasons behind these numbers. It may be problematic to make assumptions without considering the complex factors that contribute to abortion rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim focuses on the number of abortions among black women in NYC, it does not explore alternative explanations for these statistics. Factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic disparities, and personal choices may contribute to the higher abortion rates among black women, but the claim does not address these potential explanations."}
