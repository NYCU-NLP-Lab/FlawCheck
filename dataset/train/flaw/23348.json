{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the deaths of 10 South African children on disproving the notion that young people and children are less susceptible to contracting the virus. The experts state that while children can contract the virus, they generally get less sick, and the deaths of a few children do not completely disprove the theory.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deaths of 10 South African children prove that young people and children are not less susceptible to contracting the virus. However, the experts point out that the total number of deaths is not an accurate measure of how likely children are to become infected, and incidence rates show less infection in children compared to adults.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that young people and children are not less susceptible to contracting the virus. The experts mention that the deaths of children with comorbidities may be more likely, but there is no sufficient data or evidence provided to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the deaths of the 10 South African children. The experts state that some children may still become very sick or die from the illness, but they make up a small proportion of total deaths in South Africa."}
