{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of low-wage workers who would receive a raise by stating it as \"more than 40 million low-wage workers,\" while the study itself mentioned the number as 39.7 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 would benefit more than 40 million low-wage workers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that no net jobs will be lost as a result of a minimum wage increase, which is a speculative and controversial assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the numbers and time frame mentioned in the study. It glosses over the fact that the study's numbers are smaller before reaching the $15 level by 2024.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or potential negative consequences of raising the federal minimum wage to $15, such as potential job losses or negative effects on small businesses."}
