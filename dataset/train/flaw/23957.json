{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people \"in this country illegally\" who are working. The expert's verdict states that the description of 8 million as workers overstates the situation a bit.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not attempt to count the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all unauthorized immigrants who are working contribute to their communities and are working hard. This assumption may not be true for all individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working, such as the availability of job opportunities or economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not have data on the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of accurately representing the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working. The expert's verdict mentions that the description of 8 million as workers overstates the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working, as it only considers the estimate provided by Pew Research Center and does not have a breakdown of how many were working and how many were looking for work."}
