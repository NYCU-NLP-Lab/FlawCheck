{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the problem by stating that \"nearly one in three leaving our prisons are re-convicted within three years.\" The actual recidivism rate provided by the Georgia Department of Corrections is 27.5 percent, which is slightly lower than one in three.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the statement that \"one in three leaving our prisons are re-convicted within three years.\" It is unclear where this statistic is derived from.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high recidivism rate is solely due to former Georgia inmates committing crimes and being sent back to prison. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to recidivism, such as lack of rehabilitation programs or societal challenges faced by individuals upon release.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the high recidivism rate, such as systemic issues within the criminal justice system or socioeconomic factors that may contribute to criminal behavior.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual recidivism rate provided by the Georgia Department of Corrections, which is 27.5 percent, not \"nearly one in three.\"", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the financial impact of the high recidivism rate by not providing specific data on the cost of re-incarceration and the strain it puts on Georgia's correctional system.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing up-to-date information on recidivism rates. The most recent data available on the Georgia Department of Corrections website is from fiscal year 2008, which may not accurately reflect the current recidivism rate."}
