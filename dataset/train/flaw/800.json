{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that Donald Trump had a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. removed from display in the Oval Office on his first day in the White House, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. was actually removed from display.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. in a photograph indicates that it was removed, without considering other possible explanations for its absence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the absence of the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the photograph could be due to a temporary relocation or positioning.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. was still present in the Oval Office, as confirmed by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and later acknowledged by the reporter who initially made the observation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on an initial observation that turned out to be erroneous, leading to a correction by the reporter who made the observation."}
