{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states that have not opened gyms, as it only mentions North Carolina as one of four states. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that there are indeed only four states keeping gyms closed across the board.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or statistics to support the statement that North Carolina is one of four states that hasn't opened gyms. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence from multiple sources that validate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why gyms in North Carolina have not been opened. It only focuses on the actions of Governor Roy Cooper and his Republican challenger, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest."}
