{"Understate": "The claim understates the speed at which the COVID-19 vaccine was developed by suggesting that it was developed \"fast\" without acknowledging the extensive research and scientific efforts that went into its development.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that there are no vaccines against older viruses. It only presents one Instagram post and its comments as evidence, which may not be representative or comprehensive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 implies that vaccines for older viruses should also exist. However, the development of vaccines depends on various factors, including the complexity of the virus and the availability of scientific knowledge and resources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the possibility that the development of vaccines for older viruses may have faced significant challenges or may still be in progress. It assumes that the absence of vaccines for older viruses is solely due to a lack of effort or prioritization, without considering other factors such as scientific limitations or evolving research.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are vaccines for older viruses. It fails to acknowledge the existence of vaccines for diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, and measles, which have been developed and used for decades.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the speed at which the COVID-19 vaccine was developed by comparing it to the absence of vaccines for older viruses. It implies that the development of the COVID-19 vaccine was unusually fast compared to previous vaccine development efforts, without considering the unique circumstances and global collaborative efforts involved in response to the pandemic.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on anecdotal evidence from an Instagram post and its comments to support its argument. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis or consider the broader context of vaccine development efforts."}
