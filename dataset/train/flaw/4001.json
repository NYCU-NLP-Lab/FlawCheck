{"Lack enough support": "The claim of fentanyl users stabbing their needles into toilet paper rolls in public bathrooms to clean them lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that fentanyl users engage in the specific practice of cleaning needles by stabbing them into toilet paper rolls, which is a problematic assumption without substantial evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements from federal and state-level drug agencies, such as OSHA and NIDA, who have denied familiarity with the practice of cleaning needles in this manner.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the unlikelihood of fentanyl poisoning through skin exposure alone, as stated by the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to support the claim that fentanyl users are actively contaminating toilet paper rolls in public restrooms, which suggests an exaggeration of the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the mixing of previously established rumors about fentanyl poisoning via skin contact.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of credibility and reliability due to the lack of supporting evidence and contradictory statements from reputable sources."}
