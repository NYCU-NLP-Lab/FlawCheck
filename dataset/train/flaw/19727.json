{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Romney had uniforms made in Burma. While it is confirmed that the uniforms for the torch bearers came from Burma, it is unclear if all the uniforms for the 2002 Winter Olympic games were made there.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Romney had the uniforms made in Burma. The only evidence provided is a quote from Marker Ltd's Olympic program managing director, but there is no additional information or sources to corroborate this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's decision to have uniforms made in Burma supports human rights abuses. While the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions protested the use of products from Burma, it does not necessarily mean that Romney was aware of or supported human rights abuses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why the uniforms were made in Burma. The claim does not explore other possible reasons for this decision, such as cost, availability, or quality of the uniforms.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all uniforms for the 2002 Winter Olympic games were made in Burma. While the uniforms for the torch bearers did come from Burma, it is stated that there were many different uniforms used in the games, and it is unclear where the others were made.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the origins of the uniforms. It focuses primarily on the torch bearer uniforms and does not provide a complete picture of all the uniforms used in the 2002 Winter Olympic games."}
