{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that college tuition nationwide has gone up \"something like four times the rate of inflation.\" The actual increase may not be exactly four times the rate of inflation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the statement that college tuition has risen four times the rate of inflation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rate of increase in college tuition compared to inflation is a significant factor in determining affordability or the need for tuition caps.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the rise in college tuition, such as increased costs of education, changes in funding, or other economic factors, which are not addressed in the claim."}
