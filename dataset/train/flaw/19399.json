{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as economists have not modeled the potential job losses caused by increasing the minimum wage to $15, which is more than double the current level.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that increasing the minimum wage to $15 would reduce spending on government assistance programs by over $7.6 billion a year, without considering the potential negative effects on employment or hours.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential savings on government assistance programs if the minimum wage were increased to $12, as a study suggests that it could save $17 billion annually.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the potential impact of increasing the minimum wage, as some economists express skepticism about the research suggesting that modest minimum-wage increases do not consistently generate negative effects."}
