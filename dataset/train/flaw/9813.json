{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decline in two-parent, monogamous black families by stating that only 20 percent of black children are currently being raised in such families. The actual figure is 34 percent, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to accurately portray the decline in black families. While it is true that the percentage of black children living in two-parent households has decreased since 1960, the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to fully support the extent of the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decline in two-parent black families. Economic opportunities for women have risen over the decades while falling for men, which has contributed to a drop in marriage rates and an increase in single-parent households. This suggests that factors beyond welfare programs may be influencing the decline."}
