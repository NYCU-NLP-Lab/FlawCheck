{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of suspected terrorists obtaining guns by stating that 91% of them were able to obtain the weapon they wanted. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that the majority of suspected terrorists are successfully purchasing guns.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is based on a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, there may be a lack of additional supporting evidence or studies to back up the claim. This could suggest that the claim lacks enough support to be considered completely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that preventing people on the FBI terrorist watch list from purchasing guns will effectively reduce the threat of terrorism. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks other potential methods or factors that could contribute to acts of terrorism.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why suspected terrorists may be able to obtain guns, such as purchasing them through illegal channels or obtaining them from other sources. This alternative explanation could challenge the claim's assertion that preventing gun purchases would significantly impact suspected terrorists' access to weapons."}
