The only evidence provided is the statement made by the guest, which was immediately corrected.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mistake made by the guest reflects the views or concerns of Fox News as a whole. However, it is not supported by any additional evidence or statements from Fox News.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the mistake made by the guest, such as a slip of the tongue or a simple error in speech. It immediately assumes that Fox News is \"worried\" about homeless people injecting marijuana."}
