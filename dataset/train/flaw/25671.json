{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that hundreds of people fainted after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine in Indonesia. The only evidence provided is a video that shows people fainting, but it does not establish a causal link between the vaccine and the fainting incidents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fainting incidents shown in the video are directly caused by the Covid-19 vaccine. However, there is no evidence or scientific explanation provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video footage used in the claim is actually from a different incident involving diphtheria vaccinations, not Covid-19 vaccinations. This alternative explanation undermines the claim that the fainting incidents are related to the Covid-19 vaccine.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video footage used is not related to the Covid-19 vaccine but rather to diphtheria vaccinations. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who fainted after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine by using the term \"hundreds\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading evidence and making assumptions without sufficient support."}
