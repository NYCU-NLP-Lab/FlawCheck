{"Understate": "The claim states that Hillary Clinton refused to congratulate Ginny Thrasher, but the expert's verdict clarifies that Clinton did not specifically congratulate her.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Clinton refused to congratulate Thrasher.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's lack of recognition for Thrasher is due to the sport involving the use of a gun, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Donald Trump's Twitter account also did not issue any congratulations to Thrasher, suggesting that it may not be a deliberate action by Clinton alone."}
