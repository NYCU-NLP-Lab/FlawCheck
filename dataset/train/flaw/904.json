{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of deaths caused by the HPV vaccine by stating that \"at least 9 girls per year are killed by the HPV vaccine\" without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the 12-year-old girl's death was caused by the Gardasil HPV vaccine. The article fails to address the central question of whether the vaccine actually killed her.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the death of the 12-year-old girl was directly caused by the HPV vaccine, without considering other possible factors or alternative explanations for her death.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the girl's death, such as underlying health conditions or other external factors that could have contributed to her passing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC and FDA have determined that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, with only minor side effects in some people. The claim presents a biased perspective by suggesting that the vaccine is dangerous without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the rarity of severe reactions resulting in death from the HPV vaccine by questioning the CDC's statement that such reactions are \"very rare\" and occur at a rate of \"1 out of a million.\""}
