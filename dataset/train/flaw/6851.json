{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Obama and Biden separated families and put children in cages, as the separation of families was not a blanket policy and the images used in the ad do not represent children separated from their families during the Obama administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Obama and Biden separated families and put children in cages. Immigration experts and a report from the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general contradict this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama and Biden had a policy to separate families and put children in cages, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the temporary detention of minors at the border, such as crossing the border without a parent or guardian, which was the case for the minors shown in the images used in the ad."}
