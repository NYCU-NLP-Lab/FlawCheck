{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that there are \"absolutely no patients\" at the Los Angeles hospital, which is contradicted by evidence from health officials, media reports, and patient data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the hospital, like many others in the region, was flooded with patients during the surge of COVID-19 cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a deceptive and widely viewed Facebook video, which does not provide accurate information about the hospital's situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deserted outpatient center shown in the video represents the entire hospital, which is not the case as COVID-19 patients arrive through separate entrances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the video was filmed at the outpatient center, which is not where COVID-19 patients arrive, leading to a misunderstanding of the situation at the hospital."}
