{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video \"proves\" that President Trump doesn't know the words to the national anthem, when it only shows him apparently struggling with the lyrics.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a viral video as evidence, without any additional information or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump doesn't know the words to the national anthem based on a video of him struggling with the lyrics, without considering other possible reasons for his behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for President Trump's apparent struggle with the national anthem, such as the acoustics of large arenas or other factors that could have affected his singing."}
