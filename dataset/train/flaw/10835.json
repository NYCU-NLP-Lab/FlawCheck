{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of laws protecting babies who are born alive as a result of an abortion. There are existing federal and state laws that provide protection for infants as soon as they are born, regardless of the circumstances.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there are no laws in place protecting babies born alive as a result of an abortion, which is a problematic assumption as there are existing laws that provide such protection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or examples to back up the assertion that there are no laws in place protecting babies born alive as a result of an abortion.", "Alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as legal experts and professionals have stated that newborns are indeed protected by a range of laws, including the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, state constitutions, and homicide laws.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are federal and state laws already in place that protect newborns who survive an abortion.", "Understate": "The claim understates the existence and effectiveness of the current laws that protect babies born alive as a result of an abortion. It fails to acknowledge the federal and state laws that provide such protection.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the laws that protect newborns who survive an abortion. It presents a misleading picture of the existing legal framework."}
