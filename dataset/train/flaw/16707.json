{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Nancy Pelosi has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. The expert's verdict clarifies that Pelosi has not officially endorsed either Sanders or Hillary Clinton.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or official endorsement from Nancy Pelosi endorsing Bernie Sanders for president.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nancy Pelosi has endorsed Bernie Sanders based on a Facebook page and a press release, but the expert's verdict states that Pelosi has not made an official endorsement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict, suggesting that the increase in social media sharing of the endorsement page may have been due to recent comments made by Pelosi defending Sanders' campaign, but not endorsing him."}
