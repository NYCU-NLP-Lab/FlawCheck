{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"every year air pollution protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely.\" This number may be seen as inflated or exaggerated without sufficient evidence to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that delaying air pollution protections will result in 34,000 premature deaths each year. The expert's verdict mentions the lack of specific evidence or studies to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between delayed air pollution protections and premature deaths without considering other factors that may contribute to premature deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to premature deaths, such as other sources of pollution or health-related issues unrelated to air pollution."}
