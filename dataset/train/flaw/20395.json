{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the proposed EPA plan does not explicitly state that existing coal plants must be shut down or can't burn coal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that coal burning will be severely limited in existing plants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the Obama administration will completely restrict the burning of coal in existing plants, which is not supported by the proposed EPA plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the closure of some coal plants was already planned due to age and existing federal rules against mercury emissions, and the new EPA rules may accelerate that process."}
