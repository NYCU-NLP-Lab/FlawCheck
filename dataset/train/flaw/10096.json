{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions.\" It is possible that this claim may be exaggerated, as the expert's verdict mentions that the short and general answer is yes, but does not provide specific details or evidence to support the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is rated Half True. This suggests that there may be a lack of enough support or evidence to fully validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim implies that the loss of pensions by Delphi salaried retirees was a result of \"political favoritism and backroom deals.\" This assumption may be problematic as the expert's verdict mentions that the issue is a complex one involving GM, Delphi, unions, and government agencies. It suggests that there are multiple factors at play and it may not be solely attributed to political favoritism and backroom deals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the unions received a pension rescue while salaried and managerial employees did not. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the difference in treatment between the two groups, which is not solely attributed to political favoritism and backroom deals.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been updated based on new information from a report issued by the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. This suggests that the claim may have faltered or been inaccurate in its initial assessment.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts fact. However, the lack of specific details or evidence provided in the expert's verdict raises some doubts about the accuracy and validity of the claim."}
