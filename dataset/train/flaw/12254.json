{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the extent of the mandate by stating that it was only for testing on respiratory systems and weight, when in fact it also included other fitness tests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Texas lawmakers in 2011 ordered school districts to test every student on their respiratory system and weight.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2011 Legislature was solely responsible for implementing the fitness tests, when in fact similar mandates existed prior to 2011.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the mandate, such as the concern for childhood obesity and the desire to promote physical fitness among students."}
