{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the changes in the Welsh government's guidance regarding sitting in the park on a bench. The expert's verdict states that the guidance has changed slightly, allowing people to sit down in parks as long as they spend most of their time exercising.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that you cannot sit in the park on a bench or drive to your place of exercise in Wales. The expert's verdict provides information contradicting these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rules and regulations in Wales remain the same as before for another three weeks, without providing any evidence or official statement to support this assumption. The expert's verdict states that the Welsh guidance has changed slightly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided perspective by stating that the rules in Wales do not apply to the changes announced by Boris Johnson. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Boris Johnson's statement only applied to England, and the Facebook post's claims about what is allowed in Wales are partly correct.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Welsh guidance allows for sitting in a park, having something to eat, or stopping to rest during a walk, as long as most of the time is spent exercising. The expert's verdict provides this information to counter the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the restrictions by stating that you cannot use your car to visit places other than essential shopping, helping someone shielding, or work, without any evidence or official statement to support this. The expert's verdict states that there is nothing to say you cannot use a car for these activities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the current Welsh guidance and changes made to it. The expert's verdict provides updated information and clarifies the changes in the guidance."}
