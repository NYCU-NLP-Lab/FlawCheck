{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the issue of \"more votes than voters\" by stating that it requires basic math skills to carry out the fraud, implying that it is a widespread and intentional act of voter fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there were more votes than voters in the US Presidential elections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an \"overvote\" of 200% or 300% is evidence of massive fraud, without considering alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to such a situation (e.g., data errors, discrepancies in voter registration records).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the alleged \"overvotes,\" such as data errors, discrepancies in voter registration records, or other factors that could contribute to the discrepancy between registered voters and projected votes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no substantial evidence of widespread voter fraud in the US Presidential elections. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was part of misinformation spread by the Trump campaign and has been debunked by fact-checkers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and coherent argument or evidence to support the assertion of \"more votes than voters.\" It relies on anecdotal evidence and statements made by Rudy Giuliani without providing concrete evidence or data.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
