{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money President Obama has spent on legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate. The expert's verdict mentions that the figure of $2 million is often attached to the claim, but there is no clear evidence to support this specific amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the specific amount of money President Obama has spent on legal fees. The expert's verdict mentions that they contacted Trump's office to find out where he got the number, but did not receive a response. The only source cited is a conservative news website, which reported that the Obama campaign had paid approximately $1.7 million to their law firm.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount spent on legal fees is directly related to defending lawsuits about President Obama's birth certificate. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the Obama campaign has spent money opposing an array of lawsuits, but it does not specify if all of these lawsuits were specifically related to the birth certificate controversy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that President Obama's spending on legal fees is evidence of hiding or avoiding the release of his birth certificate. However, there could be alternative explanations for the spending, such as the need to defend against multiple lawsuits or to ensure legal compliance in general.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama has released his birth certificate, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. The claim suggests that he has spent money defending lawsuits about his birth certificate, but it does not acknowledge that the birth certificate has already been made public.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by relying on a specific figure of $2 million without clear evidence to support it. The expert's verdict mentions that the number is often cited but does not provide solid proof for its accuracy."}
