{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people lost to heroin and opioid overdoses by comparing it to the peak of the AIDS epidemic without providing solid evidence or specific numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of specific data or statistics to back up the comparison between heroin and opioid overdose deaths and AIDS deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses is equal to the number of deaths from the AIDS epidemic at its peak, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in heroin and opioid overdose deaths, such as changes in drug availability, acceptance, and usage patterns, which are not addressed in the claim."}
