{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement made about windmills not generating as much energy as was invested in building them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all windmills will never generate enough energy payback, which is an oversimplification and not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim selectively quotes Thomas Homer-Dixon to create a misleading impression, while ignoring the omitted section that explains the possibility of energy payback in a good wind site within three years or less."}
