{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"almost 100% of restaurant workers in South Africa are foreign\" is an exaggeration, as official data shows that only 6.5% of restaurant workers in 2017 were foreign-born.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual percentage of foreign-born restaurant workers in South Africa, as the highest recorded percentage was 11.3% in 2011.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the statement of one individual, the South African finance minister, without providing comprehensive data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of foreign-born restaurant workers has significantly increased since 1990 without providing concrete evidence or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in the percentage of foreign-born restaurant workers, such as changes in migration patterns or economic factors, which are not explored in the claim."}
