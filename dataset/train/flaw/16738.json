{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the corpse found in Nazca, Peru is that of an alien can be seen as an exaggeration since there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on initial examinations and speculation, rather than conclusive evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mummified body is not of a human species based on the presence of three fingers, which is a problematic assumption without further scientific evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations such as the possibility of the mummified body being a result of artificial cranial deformation, a known ancient practice in Peru.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no evidence has definitively proved the existence of alien life and that previous \"alien\" discoveries have been debunked or had mundane explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, such as the involvement of a researcher who was also associated with a debunked \"alien\" discovery in 2015.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim."}
