{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"no politicians outside of Bernie Sanders and myself support legalizing marijuana\" at the \"congressional, gubernatorial, senatorial level.\" There are at least 20 other members of Congress and one governor who support the legalization of marijuana.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or examples to back up the assertion that no politicians other than Bernie Sanders and Gary Johnson support legalizing marijuana.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that only Bernie Sanders and Gary Johnson support legalizing marijuana at the federal or state level, which is a problematic assumption as there are other politicians who hold this position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations to the claim, as there are other politicians who support the legalization of marijuana at the federal or state level."}
