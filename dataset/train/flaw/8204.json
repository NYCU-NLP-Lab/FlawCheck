{"Understate": "The claim may understate the gains for low-income individuals under Rubio's tax plan, as the expert's analysis shows that taxpayers in the bottom 10 percent could see a 44.2 percent increase in their income.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gains at the lower end of the tax spectrum are the \"greatest gains, percentage-wise,\" without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that the greatest gains will be at the lower end of the tax plan, as the expert's analysis only provides limited information about the static results of the Tax Foundation analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the gains at the lower end of the tax spectrum, such as the assumptions made in the Tax Foundation's analysis and the potential impact on low-income Americans."}
