{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the progress made in the fight against the opioid crisis by stating that the numbers are \"way down\" when the most recent statistics show a rise in overdose deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the numbers are \"way down\" in relation to the opioid crisis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in opioid prescriptions automatically translates to progress in addressing the opioid crisis, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise in overdose deaths despite the decrease in opioid prescriptions, such as the increase in deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl."}
