{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerated because it states that an image of the Hindu goddess Kali was projected onto the Empire State Building, while the provided information only mentions that the image of Kali was included in a larger light show that projected images of endangered animals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to confirm that the image of Kali was indeed projected onto the Empire State Building.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of the image of Kali in the light show was controversial or disturbing without providing evidence or diverse perspectives to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the image of Kali was not projected onto the Empire State Building, but rather included in the light show in a different format or location. However, this alternative explanation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information."}
