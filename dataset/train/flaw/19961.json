{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the COVID-19 death rate is \"way down.\" While it is true that deaths have fallen since their peak in late April, the claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the extent to which the death rate has decreased.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the COVID-19 death rate is \"way down.\" It does mention that deaths have fallen consistently since their peak in late April, but it does not provide specific numbers or statistics to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in COVID-19 deaths is solely due to the administration's pandemic response, without considering other factors such as social distancing measures, healthcare advancements, or individual behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in COVID-19 deaths, such as improved treatment protocols, increased testing and contact tracing efforts, or changes in demographics of those infected.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 death rate. It does not address potential fluctuations or changes in the death rate over time, and it does not acknowledge the possibility of a reversal in the trend."}
