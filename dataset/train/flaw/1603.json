{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Brian Kemp's success in fighting the Obama administration to stop illegal immigrants from voting. The expert's verdict mentions that courts dismissed Kemp's lawsuits and there is no indication that Obama wanted illegal immigrants to vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that Brian Kemp \"fought Obama twice and won\" to stop illegal immigrants from voting. The expert's verdict mentions that the lawsuits filed by Kemp were dismissed by the courts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama wanted immigrants in the country illegally to vote, which is not supported by any evidence mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the lawsuits filed by Kemp, stating that they were related to voter verification procedures and proof of citizenship requirements, rather than specifically targeting illegal immigrants."}
