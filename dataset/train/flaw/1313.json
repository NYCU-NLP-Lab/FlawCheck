{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the budget actions by stating that the average home in the city of Milwaukee would experience a $19 decrease in county taxes. The expert's analysis clarifies that this decrease is only applicable to the county share of taxes and does not take into account other factors such as changes in property value.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that the average home in the city of Milwaukee would experience a $19 decrease in county taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the increase in property taxes is justified by the enhancement of public safety. This assumption is not adequately supported or explained.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the claim. The decrease in county taxes on the average home in the city of Milwaukee is primarily due to a decrease in property value, rather than the actions of the Milwaukee County Board on the 2013 budget.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the property tax levy was actually higher in the 2013 budget compared to the previous year. The expert's analysis provides evidence of the increase in the property tax levy, which contradicts the claim's assertion of a decrease in county taxes.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the budget actions by focusing solely on the decrease in county taxes on the average home in the city of Milwaukee. The expert's analysis suggests that there is more to the story, including the overall impact of the real estate bust on property values.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a confusing explanation of the tax levy increase as a decrease for City of Milwaukee taxpayers. The expert's analysis highlights the confusion and lack of clarity in the claim's explanation."}
