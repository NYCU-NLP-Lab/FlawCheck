The expert's verdict states that the accuser did not confess on Facebook but rather attempted to contact Banks through the platform.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the accuser fabricated her accusation, but the expert's verdict does not provide clear evidence or a definitive explanation for why she made the false accusation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the accuser's false accusation, such as fear of her older sister finding out or concern about Banks bragging to friends."}
