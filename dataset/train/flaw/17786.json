{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the quote by presenting it as a real quote from George Washington when it is actually listed as a spurious quotation on the Mount Vernon website.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the quote is indeed from George Washington, as the Mount Vernon website states that they have not found an explanation for this misquote or a similar quote of Washington's that was confused for this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quote is authentic without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise of fabricated Washington quotes, such as the deepening political divides in the country and the ease of creating and sharing memes on social media platforms."}
