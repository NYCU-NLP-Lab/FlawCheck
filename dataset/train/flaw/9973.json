{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Americans who will lose their insurance under Obamacare by stating that it could be up to 20 million, while the actual estimates range from 1 million to 5 million, depending on different scenarios.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single study by the Congressional Budget Office, which provides a range of estimates that do not align with the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Americans who currently have insurance and like it will lose it under Obamacare, which may not be the case for everyone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations and estimates provided by other groups, such as the Urban Institute, the Lewin Group, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which project smaller declines in the number of people losing their insurance."}
