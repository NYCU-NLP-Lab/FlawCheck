{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the final pitch of Don Larsen's perfect game was high and outside by stating it was \"a foot and a half probably high and outside.\" This suggests a significant deviation from the strike zone.", "Falters at times": "The claim suggests that the umpire, Babe Pinelli, rushed the game to a conclusion in order to preserve the perfect game. This implies that Pinelli may have made a mistake or acted improperly in his decision-making.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or specific data to support the assertion that the final pitch was \"a foot and a half probably high and outside.\" It relies solely on the opinion of George Will, a baseball fan and columnist.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a blown call by an umpire in a historic perfect game does not significantly impact the sport of baseball. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the umpire's call or the impact of the blown call on the game. It presents the biased perspective that baseball has survived and thrived despite such errors."}
