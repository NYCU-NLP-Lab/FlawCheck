{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Hillary Clinton may have earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than Pat Toomey made in six years. This is an exaggerated statement as there is no evidence or information provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to the Toomey campaign multiple times to gather information about his earnings on Wall Street, but they did not receive a response. Therefore, there is a lack of supporting evidence for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that Wall Street was a different place 30 years ago and that Wall Street traders generally earned significant bonuses along with their salaries. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the difference in earnings between Clinton and Toomey during their respective times on Wall Street.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing concrete evidence or specific figures to support the assertion that Clinton earned more in a single speech than Toomey did in six years. This lack of supporting information weakens the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's earnings from a single speech on Wall Street would be significantly higher than Toomey's earnings over six years, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption."}
