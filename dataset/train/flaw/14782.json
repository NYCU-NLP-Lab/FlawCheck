{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Senator John McCain and Rep. Maxine Waters fell for prank phone calls by Russian hackers. The provided evidence includes audio recordings and doubts expressed by viewers, but it is not conclusive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the audio recordings featuring Senator John McCain and Rep. Maxine Waters are genuine and not impersonations by Russian pranksters. However, there are doubts raised about the authenticity of the voices in the recordings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the audio recordings are impersonations by the Russian pranksters Lexus and Vovan, who are known for their prank phone calls to high-profile individuals.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Senator John McCain previously met with the real Volodymyr Groysman, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, in June 2016. It is unlikely that McCain would be fooled by a fluent English-speaking prankster pretending to be Groysman.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility that the voices in the prank phone call recordings could be genuine, as it does not completely rule out the authenticity of the conversations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a conclusive verdict on whether the prank phone calls actually occurred or if they were successful in fooling Senator John McCain and Rep. Maxine Waters. The evidence provided raises doubts but does not provide a definitive answer.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration bias present in the claim."}
