{"Exaggerate": "The claim of losing $500 million in economic impact from HB2 fallout may be an exaggeration, as the actual losses reported in the CAP study were $86.3 million by mid-April, with a potential future loss of $481.2 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a study by the Center for American Progress, which may not be the only source of information on the economic impact of HB2.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the economic impact is solely due to HB2, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the losses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the economic impact, such as changes in the overall economy or other policy decisions that could have influenced the losses.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of a $500 million loss in the context of North Carolina's $500 billion GDP, suggesting that it may not be a substantial amount in the grand scheme of things.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the actual losses reported in the CAP study were $86.3 million, rather than the claimed $500 million.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times due to inconsistencies in the figures reported, such as the discrepancy in the Lionsgate loss attributed to an outdated report."}
