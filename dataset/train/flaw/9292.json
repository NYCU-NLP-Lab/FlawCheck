{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rick Perry did support the 2008 legislation to rescue Wall Street firms, as evidenced by the letter he co-wrote with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Perry did support the legislation, as it only mentions his denial without providing sufficient evidence to support his denial.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Perry did not support the legislation, as it only includes his denial without presenting any additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Perry's denial is true without considering the evidence that suggests otherwise, such as the letter he co-wrote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to Perry's denial, as the letter he co-wrote with Manchin suggests that he did support the legislation but later tried to downplay his support.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the evidence surrounding Perry's support or lack thereof for the 2008 legislation."}
