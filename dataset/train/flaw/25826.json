{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the person in the video is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Iyengar, a renowned Indian yoga teacher.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person in the video is Narendra Modi without providing concrete evidence or verification. This assumption is problematic as it contradicts the evidence found through reverse image search and the identification of the person as B.K.S. Iyengar.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the person in the video is B.K.S. Iyengar, not Narendra Modi. The evidence from the expert's verdict supports this alternative explanation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the person in the video is B.K.S. Iyengar, not Narendra Modi. The expert's verdict provides evidence from a reverse image search and identification of the person as B.K.S. Iyengar.", "Understate": "The claim understates the importance of correctly identifying the person in the video. It presents the video as showing Narendra Modi practicing yoga in his youth, when in fact it shows a different individual.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
