{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the impact of melting icebergs on sea level rise by suggesting that it won't have any effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a simple experiment with ice cubes in a glass of water, which does not provide enough evidence to support the conclusion that melting icebergs won't impact sea level rise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the experiment with ice cubes in a glass of water accurately represents the behavior of melting icebergs in the ocean, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation based on the principle of Archimedes and the difference in temperature and salinity between ice and seawater, suggesting that changes in the amount of floating ice can affect global sea levels."}
