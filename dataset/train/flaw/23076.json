{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that BJP/RSS workers celebrated their victory by attacking a church in Mangaluru.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or news reports to back up the allegation of an attack on a church by BJP/RSS cadres.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the video being shared is from a 2008 incident and is being misrepresented as a recent attack. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of BJP/RSS cadres attacking a church after the 2018 Karnataka state elections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no recent incident of an attack on a church by BJP/RSS cadres, as per the expert's investigation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading video from 2008 as evidence of a recent attack, which undermines its credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of police beating people inside a church is evidence of a BJP/RSS cadre attacking a church, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption."}
