{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it presents the U.S. tax rate on successful small businesses as 44.6 percent, while the business tax rate in Canada is presented as 15 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific sources or data to back up the stated tax rates for small businesses in the U.S. and Canada.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it presents the tax rates without considering other factors such as provincial taxes in Canada that businesses may have to pay in addition to the federal tax rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in tax rates between the U.S. and Canada, such as variations in tax structures, social services, or economic policies."}
