{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the potential impact of the Senate immigration bill by stating that the border security measures are \"designed never to come into being\" like in 1986.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the border security measures included in the Senate immigration bill will fail to be implemented, similar to what happened in the 1986 immigration law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the border security measures in the Senate immigration bill are designed to never come into being.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the inclusion of delayed border security measures in the Senate immigration bill, such as the need for comprehensive immigration reform that addresses both immediate legalization and long-term border security."}
