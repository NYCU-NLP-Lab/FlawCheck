{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the increase in average life expectancy on the number of workers supporting a retiree. The claim states that \"three workers support one retiree\" today, which may be an exaggeration compared to the actual ratio of 2.9 workers for every retiree.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that \"16 workers supported one retiree\" in 1950. It would be helpful to have more evidence to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in average life expectancy is the sole reason for the decrease in the ratio of workers to retirees. However, the expert's verdict mentions other factors such as changes in eligibility and demographics that have contributed to this decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the decrease in the worker-to-retiree ratio, such as changes in eligibility and demographics. This implies that the claim may not fully consider all possible factors influencing the ratio."}
