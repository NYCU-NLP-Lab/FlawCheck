{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states a 67 percent increase in the number of children taken into state custody since 2014, which is a significant rise.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 2018 data provided by the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Resources has not yet been published, so there may be a lack of complete and up-to-date data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the number of children taken into state custody is solely due to the opioid epidemic, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanations": "The expert's verdict mentions that while the number of children in foster care increased by 67 percent, the number of children entering the foster care system rose by 42 percent and the number of children waiting for adoption rose by 76 percent. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in the number of children in state custody, beyond just the opioid epidemic."}
