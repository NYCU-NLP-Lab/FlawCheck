{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates President Obama's statement by implying that he made a promise that unemployment would not go higher than 8 percent if the stimulus bill passed, when in reality it was a projection made by his economic advisers.", "Understate": "There doesn't seem to be any evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough context or evidence to support the assertion that President Obama made a definitive promise regarding unemployment rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that President Obama made a direct promise about unemployment rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's statement was a promise, when it was actually a projection made by his economic advisers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the claim fails to consider, which is that the economic downturn and other factors could have contributed to the higher unemployment rates, rather than solely blaming the stimulus bill."}
