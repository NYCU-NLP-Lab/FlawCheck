{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that illegal tobacco sales, driven by high prices, have been connected to several cases of funding terrorism over a long period of time. This may be an exaggeration as the evidence provided does not clearly support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the connection between illegal tobacco sales and funding terrorism. The evidence provided includes statements from politicians and a State Department report, but it does not directly link the two.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high cigarette prices and illegal tobacco sales are directly linked to funding terrorism. This assumption may not be supported by concrete evidence and could be seen as problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the link between illegal tobacco sales and funding terrorism. It assumes that high prices are the sole driving factor, without exploring other potential factors or motivations."}
