{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there are 3 million jobs that go vacant each month in the country lacks enough support. The expert's analysis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports only provides data for specific months and does not consistently support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of job openings reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics accurately represents the total number of vacant jobs in the country. However, this assumption may be problematic as the reports only provide data for specific months and may not capture the full extent of job vacancies.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of job vacancies in the country. The expert's analysis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports shows that there were consistently high numbers of job openings throughout 2012, suggesting that the actual number of vacant jobs may be higher than the claimed 3 million.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and consistent basis for the stated number of job vacancies. The expert's analysis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports shows variations in the number of job openings throughout different months, indicating a lack of consistency in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported number of job vacancies. The expert's analysis solely relies on the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports and does not explore other factors that may contribute to the number of job vacancies, such as job market conditions or specific industries."}
