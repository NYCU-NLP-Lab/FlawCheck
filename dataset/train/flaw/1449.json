{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that pediatricians have cut down on the number and proximity of vaccines because they recognize there have been \"too many in too short a period of time.\" However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that pediatricians have reduced the number and proximity of vaccines due to recognizing an excessive number of vaccines in a short period of time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that parents' pressure to delay vaccines may be a reason why some pediatricians acquiesce to these requests, but this decision is not based on scientific evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of following the recommended vaccine schedule, as leading medical organizations have concluded that the scheduling of vaccines, including multiple ones at once, is safe.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that decades of epidemiological research have demonstrated that autism rates do not increase when vaccines are introduced to a population.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which pediatricians have reduced the number and proximity of vaccines based on the recognition of too many vaccines in a short period of time, as there is no evidence to support this claim."}
