{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the birthday greeting cards from the U.S. president are not limited to individuals who are turning 100, but are available to anyone above 80 years old.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. president will automatically send a letter of congratulations or birthday greeting card to Americans who turn 100 years old, which is not the case. The individuals have to request it through the appropriate channels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that individuals need to contact the White House, their local representative, or senator to request a birthday greeting card from the president."}
