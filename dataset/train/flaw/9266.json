{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of procedures performed by abortion providers in Texas. The expert's verdict mentions that in 2016, there were 54,507 abortions performed in Texas, which is lower than the claimed number of almost 60,000 procedures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the stated number of procedures. The expert's verdict mentions that the number comes from reports published by the state's Health and Human Services Commission, but it does not provide further details on the accuracy or reliability of these reports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all abortions performed in Texas are \"innocent babies.\" This assumption may be seen as problematic as it reflects a specific ideological perspective on abortion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in the number of abortions performed in Texas, such as the impact of restrictive abortion laws and limited access to abortion services. The expert's verdict mentions that the number of abortions has been declining as the state has tightened restrictions on the procedure."}
