{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines by stating that they may cause a wide range of life-threatening side effects, including death. The expert's verdict clarifies that the FDA has not found any reason to believe that the vaccines could cause death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a document from the FDA that mentions possible adverse event outcomes, but it does not provide concrete evidence that these outcomes will occur or that death is a likely side effect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because the FDA has identified possible adverse event outcomes, including death, it means that the vaccines may cause these side effects. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the FDA's list includes all possible side effects, not known side effects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that GreenMedInfo, the source of the claim, has a history of making false claims about vaccines. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as misinformation or biased reporting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FDA has not found any evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines awaiting approval could cause death. The expert's verdict clarifies that the FDA is monitoring for potential adverse side effects but has not found any indication of death being a side effect.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
