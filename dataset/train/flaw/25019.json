{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single study conducted by researchers from Germany.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that capsaicin can help beat breast cancer based on its potential effect on a cell line representative of the most aggressive form of breast cancer. However, this assumption may not necessarily apply to all types of breast cancer.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of capsaicin on breast cancer by only focusing on its ability to induce cell death and not considering other potential effects or limitations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear explanations for the mechanisms involved in capsaicin-induced apoptosis and stating that they remain elusive.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to breast cancer treatment, such as other biological pathways or treatments."}
