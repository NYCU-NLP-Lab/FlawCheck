{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of President Obama in the release of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, suggesting that he personally released Baghdadi in 2009.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that President Obama directly released Baghdadi in 2009.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the release of Baghdadi by Obama is a significant factor in the rise of ISIS, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the Defense Department, stating that Baghdadi was actually released in 2004, not 2009. This alternative explanation challenges the claim made in the statement."}
