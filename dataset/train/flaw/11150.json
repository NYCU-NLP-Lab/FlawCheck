{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"polls show that Americans 'overwhelmingly' support 'expanding background checks.'\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the polls mentioned accurately represent the views of all Americans, without considering potential biases or limitations in the polling methods.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for expanding background checks by using the term \"overwhelmingly\" without providing specific percentages or a comprehensive analysis of all relevant polls.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the senators' decision to vote against expanding background checks, such as concerns about the effectiveness or potential infringements on Second Amendment rights.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Senate failed to advance a bill to expand background checks, suggesting that the support mentioned in the claim did not translate into legislative action.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a personal anecdote from Gabrielle Giffords and emotional appeals rather than presenting a more objective analysis of the polling data."}
