{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Ronald Reagan said he felt like he was shaking the President's hand when he met Donald Trump. The quote was not attached to the photograph until long after Reagan's death and was posted on a Facebook page known for sharing hoax stories and fake quotes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ronald Reagan had a positive impression of Donald Trump based on the quote and the photograph. However, the Washington Post's investigation into Reagan's archives suggests that they were not very close, and Reagan's son Michael Reagan stated that his father would likely be confused by Trump's candidacy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no record of Ronald Reagan uttering the quoted phrase upon meeting Donald Trump. The quote was added to the photograph years later and was not originally associated with it.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of a close relationship between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. The Washington Post's investigation suggests that Reagan's White House viewed Trump and his \"large ego\" warily.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photograph and the quote, such as the possibility of misattribution or fabrication.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a clear and accurate representation of Ronald Reagan's opinion of Donald Trump. It combines a genuine photograph with a quote that lacks evidence and was added to the image years later."}
