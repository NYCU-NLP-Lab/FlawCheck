{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on figures from a news story and a report, rather than comprehensive research or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the safety of vasectomies and abortions can be directly compared, which may not be a valid assumption as they are different procedures with different risks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in complication rates between vasectomies and abortions, such as the different techniques used in the procedures.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential complications of vasectomies by not considering all possible outcomes or complications.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the author of the proposal had not researched complications from procedures other than abortion, suggesting a lack of comprehensive knowledge on the topic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state does not track complications from vasectomies, making it difficult to make a direct comparison between the two procedures.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
