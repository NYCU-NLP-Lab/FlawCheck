{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that blocking a Supreme Court nomination during Obama's term would lead to an \"unprecedented year-long vacancy\" on the court. The expert's verdict points out that there have been longer vacancies in the past.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that blocking a nomination would result in a year-long vacancy. The expert's verdict also mentions that the claim does not provide accurate information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that blocking a Supreme Court nomination during Obama's term would result in an unprecedented vacancy. This assumption is problematic as it does not take into account historical precedents and other alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations and historical examples that contradict the claim. The claim fails to consider these alternative explanations."}
