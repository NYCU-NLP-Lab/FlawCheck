{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of trade barriers on the decline of farms in the last five years, as agricultural economists attribute low farm commodity prices as the main reason for the decline.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of low farm commodity prices in the decline of farms, as it solely focuses on trade barriers as the reason.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that trade barriers are the main cause of the decline in farms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that trade barriers are the primary reason for the \"very bad years\" for farms, without considering other factors such as low commodity prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by stating that consistent, near record high production for most agricultural goods has lowered prices and incomes, rather than trade barriers."}
