{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which federal revenues are the lowest in 40-50 years. The expert's verdict states that federal revenues as a share of GDP have actually been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that federal revenues are the lowest in 40-50 years. The expert's verdict provides data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to support their conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount of money the government is collecting from people, in terms of GDP, is the sole indicator of the health of federal revenues. The expert's verdict highlights other factors such as the recession and tax cuts that have contributed to the lower ratio of federal revenues to GDP.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the lower ratio of federal revenues to GDP, such as the recession and tax cuts. This implies that the claim may not consider these alternative explanations and therefore may be biased in its assessment."}
