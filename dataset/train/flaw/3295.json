{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a video circulating on social media, but there is no additional evidence or verification provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of police beating people is recent and related to the fresh COVID-19 cases in Amravati, without providing concrete evidence or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was actually uploaded on YouTube in March 2020, during the previous lockdown, which suggests that it is not recent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video may not be related to the fresh COVID-19 cases in Amravati, but rather a previous incident during the lockdown in 2020."}
