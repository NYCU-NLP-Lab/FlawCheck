{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the images show Pope Francis and other world leaders making Satanic gestures, when in fact the photos do not show them making a Satanic hand gesture.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any concrete evidence or reliable sources to back up the assertion that the gestures shown in the images are Satanic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by associating the hand gestures shown in the images with Satanic worship without considering alternative explanations or cultural interpretations of the gestures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that the hand gestures shown in the images may have different meanings in different contexts or cultures, such as the \"rock 'n' roll\" or \"rock on\" symbol used by music fans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images do not actually show religious leaders and politicians making Satanic hand gestures, as confirmed by a reverse image search conducted by AFP Fact Check.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a mixture of unrelated content, such as promoting a secessionist group in Nigeria and expressing support for Donald Trump, which is not directly related to the alleged Satanic gestures."}
