{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Australia introducing 33 different genders on birth certificates and passports is an exaggeration. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no legitimate news outlets reporting on this issue. The only sources that mention it are unreliable or have been deleted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Australia is actively introducing 33 genders, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The idea of \"33 genders\" originated from a survey conducted by Queensland University of Technology, which offered respondents 33 different choices to describe their gender. However, these choices were not all distinctly different genders and included descriptive terms and duplicative terms for the same gender concept."}
