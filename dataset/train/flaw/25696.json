{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which state lawmakers are spending taxpayer money on parking for Arthur Blank's stadium. The expert's verdict mentions a current cost of $17 million, which is expected to grow to $30 million, but it does not provide evidence of additional excessive spending.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the reasons for state lawmakers' decision to allocate funds for parking improvements. The expert's verdict mentions that the project was presented as an economic development tool and part of a broader vision for the complex, suggesting there may be alternative justifications for the spending.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks concrete evidence to support the assertion that state employees are earning so little that they qualify for food stamps. The expert's verdict mentions that the state doesn't keep data on how many of its workers are on food stamps, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence to support this aspect of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that state lawmakers should prioritize spending on state employees' salaries over parking improvements. This assumption may be seen as problematic because it does not consider other factors that might influence budget priorities, such as economic development or the potential benefits of the stadium project.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the governor was swayed to support the project by a broader argument that it could be used for conventions, the College Football Hall of Fame, and a hotel. This suggests that there may be alternative justifications for the spending on parking improvements beyond the claim's focus on Arthur Blank's stadium."}
