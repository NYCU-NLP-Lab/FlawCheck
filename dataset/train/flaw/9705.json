{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that the three winners of the $1.6 Powerball lottery have identified themselves on social media. It is unclear where this information is coming from.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the winners of the lottery have identified themselves on social media without providing any evidence or confirmation of this fact.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that as of 15 January 2015, the officially identified winners of the $1.6 billion Powerball lottery are John and Lisa Robinson of Mumford, Tennessee. This contradicts the claim that the winners have identified themselves on social media.", "Understate": "There is no evidence provided to understate or downplay the claim."}
