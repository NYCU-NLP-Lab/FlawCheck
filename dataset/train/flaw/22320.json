{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Abele's ability to balance the budget without raising taxes for five years in a row, as it fails to acknowledge that the property tax levy increased every year.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence to support the assertion that the budget was balanced without raising taxes for five consecutive years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or data to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that balancing the budget without raising taxes is a significant achievement, without considering other factors or alternative methods of achieving budget balance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as the claim fails to consider the role of the County Board in adopting a higher property tax levy than what Abele proposed, which ultimately resulted in a larger tax burden for taxpayers."}
