{"Lack enough support": "The claim made by Thomas James lacks enough support as there is no specific evidence or data provided to prove that Florida students take up to 45 school days of standardized tests per year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Florida students are taking such a significant amount of standardized tests, which may not be the case for every student or every school in the state.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that students are \"bombarded\" with an array of tests, which implies a high frequency and intensity of testing.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it mentions that the number provided by Thomas James is more than double the number mentioned by state legislative leaders in 2013, suggesting a discrepancy or inconsistency in the information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bill proposed by Senate Education Chairman John Legg, R-Trinity, which James used as a basis for his claim, states that students should spend no more than 5 percent of school hours taking tests, which does not equate to 45 school days.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as differing testing requirements or practices in different schools or districts within Florida."}
