{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the authority given to President Obama to admit refugees, stating that it was \"blanket authority\" without any background checks whatsoever.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the bill gave President Obama such broad authority.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bill would have allowed refugees, including Syrian refugees, to enter the country without any background checks, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations and differing interpretations of the bill's provisions, as highlighted by experts who disagree with Cruz's claim."}
