{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims. While he did vote for a bill that would have prohibited abortions after 20 weeks in the District of Columbia, it did include exceptions for the health and well-being of the pregnant woman.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to demonstrate that Joe Heck specifically voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims. The ad only mentions his support for a bill that would have restricted abortions after 20 weeks in the District of Columbia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Heck's vote for the bill automatically translates to criminalizing abortion for rape victims, without considering the potential exceptions and nuances of the legislation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Joe Heck's vote, such as his personal beliefs or his desire to align with his party's stance on abortion."}
