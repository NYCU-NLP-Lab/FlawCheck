{"Exaggerate": "The claim that President Obama attended an \"Islamic madrassa\" exaggerates the nature of his schooling in Indonesia, as he attended both a Catholic school and a predominantly Muslim school.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that President Obama attended an \"Islamic madrassa.\" The available information suggests that he attended a Muslim school but does not indicate any extremist or radical teachings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that attending a Muslim school automatically implies adherence to a rigid form of Islam that is hostile to the West, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for President Obama's attendance at a Muslim school, as he described himself as not very interested in either religion during his time in Indonesia. This suggests that his attendance may have been more influenced by cultural factors rather than religious beliefs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama attended both a Catholic school and a Muslim school in Indonesia, as stated in his autobiographies."}
