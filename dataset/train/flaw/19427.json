{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which 99% of revenue is being committed to debt servicing alone. The expert's verdict states that the claim about debt repayments and the amount debt takes out of revenue is correct, but it is misleading to say that the country is broke.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on figures from Nigeria's budget office for the first quarter of 2020. However, experts argue that a single quarter's revenue and debt servicing figures are not enough to make conclusions about the country's financial situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government's debt burden has made the country broke, which is deemed misleading by the expert's verdict. The expert argues that a straight comparison of debt to income is not sufficient to declare a country bankrupt, and other factors such as assets like foreign reserves should be considered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the claim. They mention that government revenue recorded in a particular quarter may be from transactions in previous quarters, and debt payments made in a quarter may have fallen due in previous quarters. These factors could affect the interpretation of the claim."}
