{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"all\" people who want President Obama impeached are white, older, and in the far right wing of the Republican Party. The evidence provided in the verdict shows that there is a significant percentage of non-whites, younger individuals, and non-Republicans who also support impeachment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the desire for impeachment is solely based on race, age, and political affiliation. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to individuals' opinions on impeachment.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by some poll numbers, the evidence provided in the verdict does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the relevant polls and their findings. Therefore, it may lack enough support to make a definitive conclusion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the desire to impeach President Obama. It solely attributes it to race, age, and political affiliation without exploring other possible motivations or reasons.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the support for impeachment among certain demographics, such as conservatives and Republicans. The evidence shows that a significant percentage of these groups do support impeachment, but the claim does not acknowledge this fully.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all people who want President Obama impeached are white, older, and in the far right wing of the Republican Party. The evidence provided in the verdict shows that there is a diverse range of individuals who support impeachment.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the demographics of those who support impeachment. The evidence provided in the verdict shows some variations in the percentages among different age groups and racial backgrounds, suggesting that the claim's generalization may not always hold true."}
