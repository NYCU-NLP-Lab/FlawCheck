{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Arizona is spending less on a per-capita basis compared to other states in higher education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on one study and does not consider fiscal year 2016 data for some states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that conservative states are the appropriate basis for comparison in terms of higher education funding, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lower per-capita spending on higher education in Arizona, such as budget constraints or different priorities in state funding.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New Hampshire is actually ranked worse than Arizona in terms of per-capita higher education funding.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Arizona's position as the worst per-capita spender in higher education, as there may be other states with even lower funding levels.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of all states' higher education funding and relying on limited data."}
