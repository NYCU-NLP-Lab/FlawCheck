{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Cards Against Humanity's actions by stating that they purchased acres of land on the U.S.-Mexico border to fight President Trump's plan to construct a border wall. While they did purchase a plot of land, it is unclear how effective this action will be in actually stopping the construction of the wall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that Cards Against Humanity's actions will have a significant impact on the construction of the border wall. The expert's verdict mentions that they have not received a response from Cards Against Humanity for further details, indicating a lack of sufficient information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's plan to construct a border wall is preposterous and will accomplish nothing. This assumption is subjective and presents a biased view of the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Cards Against Humanity's actions, such as a marketing campaign or a way to generate publicity for their brand. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and presents their actions solely in the context of fighting against the border wall."}
