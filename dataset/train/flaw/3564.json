{"Understate": "The claim states that \"Three in four low-income workers don\u2019t have any paid sick days available.\" However, the expert's verdict provides additional data that shows the percentage of low-income workers without paid sick days is actually higher than stated (82 percent).", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that three in four low-income workers do not have paid sick days. The expert's verdict mentions that the source of the claim is last year's National Compensation Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but it does not provide a direct link or further information about the survey.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of paid sick days is a significant issue for low-income workers without providing further context or analysis. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to the absence of paid sick days for this group.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why low-income workers may not have paid sick days. It does not consider factors such as the type of employment or industry in which these workers are employed, which may influence the availability of paid sick days."}
