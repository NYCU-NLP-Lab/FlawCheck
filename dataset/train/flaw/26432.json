{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of bloodied, seemingly dead pandas by stating that there are \"dozens\" of them, when in reality the images show only a few.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the images are fake. It only mentions that they were made for a campaign without providing further details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of the campaign was to \"engender concern for threatened fish,\" without providing any evidence or statements from the campaign itself to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the viral response to the photos, such as people being genuinely concerned about animal welfare or expressing shock at the images regardless of their authenticity."}
