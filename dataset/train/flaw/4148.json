{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Bernie Sanders that he won people of color \"big time\" in California's primary is an exaggeration. While he did win Latino and Asian-American voters by significant margins, he lost African-American voters to Joe Biden by more than 2-to-1.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication of the claim faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on exit polls that show Sanders winning certain demographics but losing others.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that winning Latino and Asian-American voters by large margins equates to winning people of color \"big time\" overall, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
