{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of IRS agents that would be put in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill. The claim states that \"16,500 IRS agents\" may be involved, which could be seen as an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that 16,500 IRS agents would be involved in policing the health care bill. The evidence provided by the expert suggests that the claim is not supported by the Congressional Budget Office's analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the IRS would be responsible for policing the health care bill, which may be seen as a problematic assumption. The expert's analysis suggests that the claim is not accurate and that the IRS's role would primarily be related to eligibility determination and verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the claim made by Rep. Michele Bachmann and others may have been based on a misinterpretation of the Congressional Budget Office's analysis. Therefore, there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the information."}
