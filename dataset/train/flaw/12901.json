{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the issue by suggesting that all cell phone companies began charging users for SMS emojis in February 2016, when in fact it was primarily a problem reported in the UK and some American cell phone users.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that cell phone companies began charging users for SMS emojis in February 2016. The evidence provided suggests that the issue was first reported in late 2014 and that by 2016, most mobile phone users at risk of such charges would already have incurred them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the charges incurred by users, such as new handsets being the cause of the issue. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the issue of charging for emojis was not new in 2016, as indicated by the evidence provided. The issue had been reported earlier, and rumors about it had circulated on social media.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear and consistent information about the scope of users still at risk of incurring emoji-based charges. It mentions the issue being reported in the UK, but it is unclear if it applies to users outside the UK.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the issue by highlighting a specific case of a woman being charged \u00a31,200 for one month's use of emoticons. This case may not represent the typical experience of users.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that cell phone users were not aware of the charges for emojis, which may not be true for all users. The evidence suggests that some users were aware of the charges and had incurred them."}
