{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential job loss by stating that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour \"will destroy between half a million and one million jobs.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates a total reduction in the workforce of about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers. The claim's range of job loss (half a million to one million) may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that raising the minimum wage will lead to job destruction. It merely cites the claim made by Senator Mitch McConnell, who in turn refers to a Congressional Budget Office study. The expert's verdict provides more information from the CBO report, but it does not explicitly state whether the claim has enough support or not.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between raising the minimum wage and job destruction. It does not consider alternative factors or variables that could contribute to changes in employment levels. The expert's verdict mentions that raising the cost of employing low-wage workers may encourage companies to focus on more cost-effective ways of production, such as machines and technology. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for job changes beyond just the minimum wage increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for job changes, such as companies adopting more cost-effective production methods or employing more productive higher-wage workers. This implies that job loss or reduction may not solely be attributed to the minimum wage increase, but rather a combination of factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CBO report also noted that a minimum wage hike would lift \"over a million Americans out of poverty.\" The expert's verdict mentions that this statement was rated as \"Mostly True\" in a separate fact-check. The claim, by focusing solely on the potential job loss, contradicts the fact that a minimum wage increase can have positive effects on poverty reduction.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the potential positive impact of raising the minimum wage by only focusing on job loss. The expert's verdict mentions that the CBO report found that most low-wage workers would receive higher pay, increasing their family's income. However, the claim does not acknowledge or address this aspect, potentially understating the overall impact of a minimum wage increase.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential effects of raising the minimum wage. It focuses primarily on the negative impact of job loss without considering the potential positive effects on poverty reduction and increased income for low-wage workers. The expert's verdict provides a more balanced assessment by presenting both sides of the argument."}
