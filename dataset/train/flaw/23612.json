{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Pakistan's first lady Bushra Bibi's image does not appear in mirrors is based on an unnamed member of the PM House staff and a screenshot from Pakistan's Capital TV. There is no additional evidence or sources provided to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The article initially published by ANI and later deleted suggests that there was confusion and conflicting information regarding the claim. Capital TV denied publishing any such report and accused ANI of using a \"photoshopped poster\" with their logo.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the information provided by an unnamed member of the PM House staff and a screenshot from Capital TV is accurate and reliable. However, there is no way to verify the credibility of these sources or the claim itself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions that some Pakistani journalists alleged that the picture is photoshopped, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the denial by Capital TV, which stated that they did not publish any such report and blamed ANI for using a \"photoshopped poster\" with their logo.", "Exaggerate": "The claim that Pakistan's first lady's image does not appear in mirrors may be seen as an exaggerated or sensationalized statement, as it is not supported by substantial evidence or credible sources."}
