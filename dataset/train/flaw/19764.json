{"Understate": "The claim understates the findings of the CDC study by stating that an \"overwhelming majority\" of individuals who contracted coronavirus had worn a mask or face covering, when in fact, nearly three-quarters of people interviewed in the study reported wearing a mask or cloth face covering.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific details or evidence from the CDC study to back up its assertion that masks and face coverings are ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the CDC study proves that masks and face coverings are ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19, when the CDC report itself did not suggest this conclusion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the findings of the CDC study, such as the possibility that people may not have been wearing masks properly or consistently, rather than the masks themselves being ineffective.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC report concluded that masks and face coverings can be effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19 when worn properly.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the CDC study by making a sweeping generalization that masks and face coverings are ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19 based on the reported cases of individuals who contracted the virus while wearing masks."}
