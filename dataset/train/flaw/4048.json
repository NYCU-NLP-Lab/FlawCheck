{"Lack enough support": "The claim that out-of-state drivers would contribute $73 million to fix Wisconsin's roads lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The only source mentioned is a conversation with the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, but no specific details or calculations are provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if out-of-state drivers paid the gas tax, the entire amount would go towards fixing roads. It does not consider other potential uses for the revenue or other funding sources for road repairs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why the proposed gas tax increase was rejected by Republican lawmakers. The claim does not explore other factors that could have influenced their decision.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the potential contribution of out-of-state drivers to road repairs. It only mentions a range of 10-15% of vehicle fuel tax revenue, which could be higher or lower than the $73 million figure.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on a tweet by state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, which may not always be the most reliable or accurate source of information.", "Contradict fact": "There is no specific contradiction of facts mentioned in the provided information.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
