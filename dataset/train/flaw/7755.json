{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance and recentness of the footage by suggesting that it shows \"recent footage\" of Niger Delta militants, when in fact the video has been online since at least 2017.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the timing and context of the video, as it suggests that the footage is directly related to the recent protests against police brutality in Nigeria, when it has been circulating for several years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the video shows Niger Delta militants. The provided evidence only mentions armed men in a flotilla, without specifying their affiliation or identity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the armed men shown in the video are Niger Delta militants, without providing any direct evidence or confirmation of their identity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it has been online since 2017 and may not be directly related to the recent protests or Niger Delta militants."}
