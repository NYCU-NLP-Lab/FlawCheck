{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in Pope Francis' mood during visits with President Obama and President Trump, as the expert explains that the selection of images was chosen to paint Trump in a negative light and that other images could be selected to illustrate the opposite.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Pope enjoyed visiting Obama more than Trump or vice versa, as the expert states that the viral comparison does not offer proof of any kind.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Pope's mood in the photographs accurately reflects his enjoyment of the visits with the presidents, which may be a problematic assumption as the expert explains that the Pope's mood during the photo-op with Trump was not necessarily indicative of his overall mood.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the difference in the Pope's mood in the photographs, such as different moments captured during the visits or the Pope's personal mood on those particular occasions."}
