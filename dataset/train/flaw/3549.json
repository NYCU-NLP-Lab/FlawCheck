{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert mentions that the evidence for menstrual synchronization is based on a small population monitored for a short period of time.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as the expert mentions that there are methodological and theoretical flaws in the studies that suggest menstrual synchronization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that women's menstrual cycles synchronize when they live or work in close proximity to one another, which may not be a universally accepted assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there are alternative explanations for menstrual synchronization, such as the need to minimize the risk of being monopolized by a dominant male or engaging in polyandry.", "Contradict fact": "The expert mentions that while some studies demonstrate the presence of menstrual syncing, there are also studies that question its existence, indicating a contradiction in the evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and variability of menstrual synchronization, as the expert mentions that the literature provides far from conclusive evidence for its existence.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
