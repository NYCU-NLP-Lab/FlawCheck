{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the decrease in per-student spending by stating that schools will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003. This may be an exaggeration if other years are taken into account where the spending difference is smaller or even increased.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the fact that per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. By focusing only on the decrease in funding from 2003 to 2017, it fails to acknowledge that spending has not significantly increased during that time period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it relies on a report from a liberal think tank without providing additional evidence or data to back up the assertion. This lack of supporting evidence weakens the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that per-student spending should always increase over time to adequately fund public education. However, it does not consider other factors such as changes in enrollment, shifts in funding priorities, or improvements in efficiency that may impact the need for increased funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in per-student spending, such as changes in the overall budget or shifts in funding allocations within the education system. It presents the decrease as solely due to a lack of funding without exploring other possible factors."}
