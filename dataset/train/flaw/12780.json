{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Hillary Clinton withheld her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement until it had been negotiated. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Clinton made strongly supportive comments about the deal while negotiations were still ongoing.", "Understate": "The claim understates the level of support that Clinton initially had for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Clinton used words such as \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" and \"high-quality\" to describe the partnership before it was finalized.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify whether Clinton truly waited until the terms of the proposal had been finalized before deciding whether to endorse it. The expert's verdict questions whether Clinton actually withheld her support until the deal was finalized and provides evidence of her previous supportive comments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's decision to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement was solely based on waiting until it had been negotiated. The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for her change in stance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's change in stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The expert's verdict suggests that there may be other factors influencing her decision."}
