{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Wisconsin Republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months, when in fact they passed a COVID-19 response bill in April.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the Legislature typically adjourns in spring of an election year and doesn't come back until the new calendar year, which is a normal period of inaction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Wisconsin Republicans have not passed any bills in 6 months, as there is evidence of a COVID-19 response bill being passed in April.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of bills passed by Wisconsin Republicans is solely due to their inaction, without considering other factors such as the ongoing pandemic and political disagreements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the lack of bills passed, which is the cyclical nature of the Legislature and the typical period of inaction during an election year."}
