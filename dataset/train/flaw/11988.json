{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks basic details such as the date of the beach visit, how doctors traced the infection back to that visit, and whether anyone else was affected by the same bacteria.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the poor water quality at Myrtle Beach is the direct cause of the woman's infection, but this has not been confirmed by DHEC or doctors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The woman's infection may have come from a simple cut she obtained on a balcony, and spending time in the ocean may not be the sole cause of the infection.", "Contradict fact": "The City of Myrtle Beach responded to the claim, stating that the bacterial issues had not been definitively linked to water quality in the area.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential causes of the woman's infection by solely attributing it to poor water quality, while there may be other factors involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and clear evidence to support the direct link between poor water quality and the woman's specific infection.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
