{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the alleged disrespect shown by Rahul Gandhi by stating that he saluted with his left hand, when in fact the original photo shows him saluting with his right hand.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Rahul Gandhi disrespected the Indian flag by saluting with his left hand. The provided evidence, including the original photo and various media reports, contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that saluting with the left hand is a sign of disrespect towards the Indian flag, without providing any basis or explanation for this assumption. The Indian Ministry of Defence guidelines state that salutes should be given with the right hand, but it does not necessarily imply disrespect if done otherwise.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rahul Gandhi actually saluted with his right hand, as evidenced by the original photo and multiple media reports. The claim is therefore false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the photo being doctored or manipulated to create a false narrative. The existence of a mirrored version of the photo and the fact that it was shared alongside similar claims on social media suggest that there may be alternative motives behind spreading this misinformation."}
