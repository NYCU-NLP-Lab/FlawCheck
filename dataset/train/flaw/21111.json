{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that women in South Carolina earn exactly 76 cents on the dollar to men's earnings, without taking into account any variations or factors that may affect the wage gap.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that women in South Carolina earn 76 cents on the dollar to men's earnings. It only mentions a report by the National Partnership for Women and Families without providing further details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender wage gap is solely due to gender discrimination without considering other factors such as differences in occupation, education level, or time on the job. It does not acknowledge that women and men may choose different types of work that have different pay scales.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the gender wage gap, such as differences in career choices, negotiation skills, or work-life balance preferences. It only focuses on the assumption of gender discrimination as the primary cause.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the gender wage gap in South Carolina is reported to be 75.6 cents for every dollar earned by a man, as stated in a National Women's Law Center report.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the complexity of the issue by presenting a simplified statistic without taking into account various factors that contribute to the gender wage gap."}
