{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Rev. Jesse Jackson that \"homicides against blacks have tripled\" since Florida's \"stand your ground\" law has been in existence is an exaggeration. The data provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement shows that the number of black homicide victims between 2006 and 2012 barely changed, rising from 524 to 532.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or data provided to back up the assertion that homicides against blacks have tripled due to the \"stand your ground\" law. The data provided actually contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between the \"stand your ground\" law and the increase in homicides against blacks. However, no evidence is presented to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of homicides of black people did not triple since the \"stand your ground\" law went into effect. The data shows a 24 percent increase, not a tripling.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any increase in homicides against blacks, such as factors unrelated to the \"stand your ground\" law."}
