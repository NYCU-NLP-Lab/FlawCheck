{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Rihanna was barred from entering Senegal on the grounds of being suspected of being part of the Illuminati, while the expert's verdict clarifies that she was not actually banned from the country and the president even joined her at an NGO event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that Rihanna was suspected of being part of the Illuminati.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that Rihanna was barred from entering Senegal solely because she was suspected of being part of the Illuminati, without considering other possible reasons or factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rihanna was not banned from Senegal and that she did visit the country, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the protests against Rihanna's visit to Senegal were led by a Muslim-led collective of religious groups who accused her of being a member of the freemasons and Illuminati, rather than her actually being barred from entering the country."}
