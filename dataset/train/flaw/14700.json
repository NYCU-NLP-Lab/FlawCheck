{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential personal benefit that President Trump and his family would receive from the tax bill by stating that they would \"walk off with more than a billion dollars personally.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the estimates are based on a leaked tax return from 12 years ago and that there is no way of knowing if 2005 was an unusual year for Trump's finances, which could skew the results of a forward-looking analysis.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim lacks important context and key differences between the House and Senate bills. The expert also notes that Doggett did not provide further information or reply to an inquiry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax bill will directly benefit President Trump and his family without considering other factors or alternative explanations. The expert's verdict mentions that the savings for Trump primarily come from the repeal of the estate tax, which is part of the House bill but not the Senate's. It also highlights that Trump's tax situation is not well-known due to his own actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the estimates of Trump's potential tax cuts are based on a partial tax return from 2005 and that a lot may have changed since then. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations or factors that could impact the actual benefit Trump would receive from the tax bill.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing accurate information or fully considering all relevant factors. The expert's verdict points out the lack of context, key differences between the House and Senate bills, and the reliance on a leaked tax return from 12 years ago.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or potential benefits."}
