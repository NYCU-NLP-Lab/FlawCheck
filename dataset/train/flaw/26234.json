{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the actions of Shadab Khan by stating that he is \"promoting how to spread coronavirus.\" It is unclear from the evidence provided if Khan is actually promoting the act of spreading the virus or if the video is being misinterpreted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to conclusively prove that Shadab Khan is promoting the spread of coronavirus. The evidence provided consists of tweets and social media posts, but there is no direct evidence or confirmation from Khan himself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Shadab Khan's actions in the video are deliberate and intended to promote the act of spitting in the middle of a pandemic. However, it is possible that the video was taken out of context or that Khan had a different intention.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Khan's actions in the video, such as a misunderstanding, a misguided attempt at humor, or a lack of awareness about the seriousness of the pandemic. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the true motive behind the video."}
