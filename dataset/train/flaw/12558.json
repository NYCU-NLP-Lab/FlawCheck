{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Josh Mandel has been absent from work by only mentioning his campaign activities and not providing a comprehensive overview of his attendance record.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that Mandel has not shown up for work. The evidence provided only shows his absence from one specific board meeting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mandel's absence from board meetings is indicative of him not showing up for work, without considering other potential work responsibilities or commitments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Mandel's absence from board meetings, such as the ability to send representatives in his place, which is permitted by statute.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a complete picture of Mandel's work attendance history and focusing on a specific incident.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mandel did attend his first board meeting on March 19, after missing 14 consecutive meetings.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Mandel's absence from work by not acknowledging that he did send representatives to board meetings and that other treasurers have also missed meetings in the past."}
