{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the severity of the injuries sustained by the protester, as there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that the legs were \"severely damaged\" or that there is a \"chance of paralysis.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the injuries were intentionally caused by a taxi hitting the protester. The expert's verdict mentions that the image has been circulating since 2017 as a stock X-ray image, suggesting that it may not be directly related to the specific incident mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the injuries shown in the X-ray are a result of intentional harm caused by the taxi driver. However, without further evidence, it is difficult to confirm this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are protesters who have claimed that the girl in the image was not injured as severely as depicted. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image has been circulating since 2017 as a stock X-ray image, suggesting that it may not be directly related to the incident involving the Hong Kong protester.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
