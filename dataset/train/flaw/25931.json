{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer/BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine contain computers, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate the claim that lipid nanoparticles contain computers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that nanotechnology and being injected with nanoparticles automatically means the presence of computers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer/BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are made of fats that naturally occur in the body or are derived from plants, according to experts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by experts that lipid nanoparticles are a form of protection for the mRNA vaccine as they enter cells, rather than containing computers."}
