{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Ken Cuccinelli's stance on birth control by stating that he wants to eliminate all forms of birth control, without providing enough evidence to support this extreme view.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Ken Cuccinelli wants to eliminate all forms of birth control. The evidence provided only refers to his support of a 2007 bill that would have extended rights to human embryos, without explicitly stating that all forms of birth control would be banned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ken Cuccinelli's support of the 2007 bill automatically translates to a desire to eliminate all forms of birth control, without considering alternative explanations or clarifying his specific stance on contraception.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Ken Cuccinelli's support of the 2007 bill, such as a belief in protecting the rights of human embryos, without necessarily intending to ban all forms of birth control."}
