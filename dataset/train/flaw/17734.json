{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of governors who have signed similar laws requiring independent investigations into deaths in police custody. The expert's verdict states that the Wisconsin Legislature found no other state required an independent investigation, but it does not definitively state that Governor Walker is the only governor who has signed such a law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Governor Walker is the only governor who has signed a law requiring independent investigations into deaths in police custody. The expert's verdict mentions the Wisconsin Legislature's findings, but it does not provide comprehensive evidence from all states to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for why Governor Walker signed the law. The claim suggests that Governor Walker signed the law as a response to the Ferguson shooting, but there could be other factors or motivations behind his decision that are not mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
