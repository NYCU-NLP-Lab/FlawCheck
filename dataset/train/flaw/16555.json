The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation of the circumstances surrounding the nominations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for the difference in treatment between Obama's and Trump's nominees, such as the timing of the nominations and the political dynamics at play.
