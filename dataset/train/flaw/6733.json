{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the photograph depicts President Obama in handcuffs, facing charges of wiretapping President Trump. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that President Obama was arrested and facing charges of wiretapping President Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama was involved in wiretapping President Trump without providing any credible evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photograph in question was doctored and taken from a 2009 news article about a different individual's arraignment. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's credibility."}
