{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert, Michael Sheedy, could not provide any concrete examples or data to support his statement that fewer people enter into marriage in jurisdictions where domestic partnerships are enacted. He only mentioned Spain as an example but could not provide any examples from the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the existence of domestic partnerships leads to fewer people entering into marriage. This assumption is not supported by evidence or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in the number of marriages in jurisdictions where domestic partnerships are enacted. The expert only mentions the redefinition of marriage as a possible cause, but does not explore other factors such as economic conditions or changing societal attitudes towards marriage.", "Falters at times": "The expert, Michael Sheedy, falters in providing evidence to support his claim. He initially claims that fewer people enter into marriage in jurisdictions with domestic partnerships but later admits that he could not find any data or examples to support this claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of domestic partnerships on the institution of marriage. While the expert's statement lacks sufficient evidence, it is possible that the availability of domestic partnerships could influence some individuals' decisions to enter into marriage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the expert, Michael Sheedy, could not provide any concrete examples or data to support his statement. This lack of evidence contradicts the claim that fewer people enter into marriage in jurisdictions where domestic partnerships are enacted.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of domestic partnerships on the decline in the number of marriages. Without sufficient evidence, it is not accurate to make a definitive statement about the relationship between domestic partnerships and marriage rates."}
