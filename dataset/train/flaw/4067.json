{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that they read the transcript and watched a 14-minute interview with Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, but it does not provide any direct quotes or specific evidence to support the claim that Kent said he finds it easier to do work in China than in the United States. Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Coca-Cola's CEO reflects the overall ease of doing work in China compared to the United States. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any information or evidence to support or challenge this assumption, so it is unclear whether it is problematic or not.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for why Coca-Cola's CEO might find it easier to do work in China than in the United States. The expert's verdict also does not provide any alternative explanations, so it is unknown if there are any other factors that could contribute to this perception."}
