{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the event by stating that it is the first time in fifteen years that the plant is running at full capacity. The expert's verdict provides information about the decline in employment and the return of jobs to the Milwaukee plant, suggesting that this may not be as significant of an achievement as the claim implies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the statement that the plant is running at full capacity. It is not clear how this information was determined or what metrics were used to make this assessment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the return of jobs to the Milwaukee plant is solely due to economic factors such as increased costs in China. The expert's verdict mentions labor problems in China, economic issues, and higher shipping rates as factors contributing to the return of manufacturing jobs. This suggests that there may be other factors at play that are not acknowledged in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the return of jobs to the Milwaukee plant. The expert's verdict mentions the White House meeting and the praise given to Master Lock by President Obama, suggesting that government incentives or policies may have played a role in the decision to bring jobs back to the plant."}
