{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it implies that Ken Cuccinelli would completely take money away from public schools to fund private schools, without considering other funding sources or the potential impact on public education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Ken Cuccinelli's plan would significantly defund public schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that empowering parents to make choices for their children's education and providing tax credits for private school tuition would automatically result in taking money away from public schools. This assumption may not consider potential alternative funding sources or the possibility of increased funding for public schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Ken Cuccinelli's plan, such as aiming to improve education options for students in failing schools or providing more choices for parents, rather than solely taking money away from public schools."}
