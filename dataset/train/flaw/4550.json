{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of requests from private law firms and companies. The expert's analysis reveals that 45.2% of the requests received by the attorney general's office came from these entities, which is a significant portion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that \"most\" of the requests are from private law firms and companies. The expert's analysis shows that the percentage is around 45%, which may not necessarily qualify as \"most.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that providing records to private law firms and companies is equivalent to providing free legal work. This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the nature of the requests and the potential benefits they may bring to the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of requests from private law firms and companies. It does not explore whether these entities have a legitimate need for the records or if there are specific circumstances that lead to their higher request rate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a significant portion of the requests (32 out of 126) came from members of the press, indicating that requests from the public and the press are also substantial.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the dominance of requests from private law firms and companies by using the term \"most.\" The expert's analysis shows that the percentage is around 45%, which may not qualify as a majority."}
