{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the length of time since a Supreme Court Justice nomination and confirmation in a presidential election year, stating it has been \"more than 80 years\" when it has actually been 76 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that breaking with the supposed \"decades of bipartisan practice\" is not the right decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a bipartisan practice of not nominating and confirming Supreme Court Justices in a presidential election year, which is not entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that the lack of nominations and confirmations in election years is not due to tradition or bipartisan practice, but rather a rare combination of circumstances.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been instances of Supreme Court Justice nominations and confirmations in presidential election years, such as Benjamin Cardoza in 1932 and Frank Murphy in 1940.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading statement about the length of time since a nomination and confirmation in an election year."}
