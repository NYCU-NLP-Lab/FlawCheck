{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CBO was not formed until 1974, while the claim refers to a CBO report from 1964.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about the CBO report in question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CBO report accurately predicted the cost of Medicare, but it does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have an alternative explanation, such as the possibility that Kingston was referring to a different source or report, as he later acknowledged the error.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost of Medicare by stating that it was already over $100 billion 10 years after its prediction of $9 billion. However, without specific evidence, it is difficult to determine the extent of exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by incorrectly referring to a non-existent 1964 CBO report, which undermines its credibility."}
