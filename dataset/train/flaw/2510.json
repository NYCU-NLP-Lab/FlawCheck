{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the difference in student loan debt repayment between white and African American borrowers by stating that 94% of white borrowers have paid off their student loan debt, while only 5% of African American borrowers have done so. The actual study found that the median debt of white borrowers had been reduced by 94% after 20 years, and the median debt of black borrowers had decreased by only 5%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the racial disparity in student loan debt repayment is solely due to racial factors, without considering other factors such as income, employment opportunities, or access to financial resources.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statistics mentioned. It does not provide specific details about the study, its sample size, methodology, or other relevant information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual findings of the study it references. The study found that 48% of white borrowers had paid off their student loans, compared to 26% of black borrowers, which is different from the claim's statement of 94% and 5% respectively.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misquoting the study and misrepresenting its findings. It incorrectly attributes specific percentages of debt repayment to white and African American borrowers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the racial disparities in student loan debt repayment, such as differences in income, wealth, or access to educational opportunities. It solely attributes the disparities to race."}
