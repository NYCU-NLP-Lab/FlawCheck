{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the pay difference between CEOs and average workers by stating that CEOs make $10,000 more every day than what the average worker makes every year. The actual pay difference may vary depending on the size and type of companies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average CEO's pay is representative of all CEOs, which may not be accurate as there is a significant variation in CEO compensation based on the size of the company.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the specific figure of $10,000 difference per day. The source provided refers to a report that mentions top CEOs' pay, but the claim does not specify if it refers to all CEOs or just the top ones.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the pay disparity between CEOs and average workers, such as differences in job responsibilities, qualifications, and market demand for CEO positions. The claim does not consider these factors.", "Understate": "The claim may actually understate the pay difference between CEOs and average workers by only focusing on the average CEO's pay. The actual difference may be higher when considering the compensation of top CEOs or CEOs at larger corporations."}
