{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Russ Feingold ignored veterans' concerns and did nothing in response to the memo outlining veteran harm.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Russ Feingold received the memo. The memo writer's original contention is not enough evidence to conclusively prove that Feingold received it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Feingold did receive the memo, he would have been aware of the veteran harm and done nothing about it. This assumption may not be valid without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why nothing was done in response to the memo, such as Feingold not receiving it or being unaware of its contents."}
