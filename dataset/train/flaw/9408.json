{"Understate": "The claim may understate the effectiveness of hand sanitizers after their expiration date by stating that they \"gradually become less effective.\" The expert's verdict suggests that if the bottle remains sealed, the sanitizer may still be effective.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that hand sanitizers become less effective after their expiration date. The expert's verdict provides more information and context but does not directly address the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that if the bottle remains sealed, the alcohol inside would not have been exposed to air, which reduces effectiveness. This implies that the sanitizer may still be effective even after the expiration date.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hand sanitizers gradually become less effective after their expiration date without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. The expert's verdict acknowledges the complexity of the issue and states that the FDA does not have information on the stability or effectiveness of drug products past their expiration date.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that hand sanitizers generally expire after two to three years of use and lose their effectiveness. The expert's verdict supports this fact by stating that hand sanitizers with alcohol generally take two to three years to expire.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
