{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of regular marijuana use on IQ, stating that it can reduce IQ by 8 points, while the expert's verdict clarifies that this only applies to smokers who began using during adolescence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points. The expert's verdict highlights the need for more research to establish a link between marijuana use and a decline in IQ points.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) unequivocally states that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points. However, the expert's verdict points out that the NIH report mentions the specific conditions under which this effect was observed and emphasizes the need for further research.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to changes in IQ, such as other environmental or genetic factors. The expert's verdict mentions that the New Zealand study cited in the NIH report only applied to smokers who began using during adolescence, indicating that there may be other factors at play.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of marijuana use on IQ by focusing only on an 8-point reduction. The expert's verdict highlights that the NIH report mentions a range of 6 to 8 IQ points as the potential loss associated with persistent marijuana use disorder with frequent use starting in adolescence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the NIH report does not explicitly state that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points. The expert's verdict clarifies that the report emphasizes the need for more research and that the findings only apply to specific conditions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the information presented in the NIH report. The expert's verdict points out the selective and misleading nature of the claim."}
