{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the contagiousness of cavities by stating that they are primarily transmitted between intimate partners or children and caregivers. The expert's verdict mentions that specific bacteria linked to cavities may be transmitted between caregivers and small children, but it does not support the claim that cavities are primarily contagious in these relationships.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific research or evidence to back up the assertion that cavities are contagious between intimate partners or children and caregivers. The expert's verdict mentions some research indicating a link between specific bacteria and cavities transmission, but it does not provide enough evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cavities are contagious primarily between intimate partners or children and caregivers. This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the transmission of cavities and ignores other potential sources or modes of transmission.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge or explore alternative explanations for the transmission of cavities. The expert's verdict mentions that specific bacteria linked to cavities may be transmitted between caregivers and small children, but it does not rule out other potential sources or modes of transmission.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any established facts, as it is based on the possibility of bacteria transmission between individuals. However, it lacks enough evidence to fully support the assertion that cavities are contagious primarily between intimate partners or children and caregivers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making generalizations and oversimplifications about the contagiousness of cavities. The expert's verdict mentions specific research and studies, but it does not fully support the claim's assertion of primary transmission between intimate partners or children and caregivers.", "Understate": "There is no significant understatement bias present in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
