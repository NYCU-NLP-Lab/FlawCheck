{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the individuals in the photos are armed robbery suspects under arrest. The evidence provided only includes a Facebook post and a news report from 2016 that matches the details mentioned in the misleading posts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals in the photos are members of a specific robbery squad based on the use of the phrase \"WA ZO BIA,\" which suggests they hail from Nigeria's three largest ethnolinguistic groups. This assumption may not be accurate or supported by evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the news report and photos are from a robbery incident that occurred in 2016, not a recent event as suggested by the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the photos by presenting them as recent and implying that the individuals are currently under arrest for armed robbery.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and not providing enough context or evidence to support its assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the photos or provide any other possible interpretations."}
