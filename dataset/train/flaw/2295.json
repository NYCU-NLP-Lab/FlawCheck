{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the requirement for 700 miles of double-layered border fencing, as the current law only mandates a single layer of reinforced fencing.", "Understate": "The claim understates the amount of fencing that has been built, as the Department of Homeland Security reports fencing on 650 miles of the border.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the changes made to the law in 2008, which removed the requirement for double-layered fencing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Obama administration refuses to build the required fencing, as it does not provide evidence or data regarding the progress of the construction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the requirement for double-layered fencing still exists, despite the amendment to the law in 2008."}
