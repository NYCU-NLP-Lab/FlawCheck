{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that there have been previous instances in comic lore where a woman has held Thor's hammer.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or examples to back up the statement that it is the first time in history that Thor's hammer is being held by a woman.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the introduction of a female God of Thunder in a new comic series is a groundbreaking event, without considering previous alternate universe storylines where women have held the hammer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the existence of previous alternate universe stories where female characters, such as Storm from X-Men, have picked up the hammer."}
