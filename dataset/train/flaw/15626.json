{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential danger of COVID-19 for younger people by comparing it to the seasonal flu and suggesting that the flu is deadlier in many cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that the seasonal flu is deadlier than COVID-19 for younger people. The evidence provided includes statistics on flu and COVID-19 deaths among children, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all relevant factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has shielded children from potential exposure to the virus, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not consider other potential sources of exposure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in hospitalizations and deaths between the seasonal flu and COVID-19, such as differences in testing and reporting methods, or the potential impact of preventive measures taken during the pandemic."}
