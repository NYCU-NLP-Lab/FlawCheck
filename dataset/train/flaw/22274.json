{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that no alderman has ever defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of the city.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because it has never happened before, it will never happen in the future. This assumption may not be valid as circumstances and political dynamics can change.", "Understate": "The claim understates the possibility of an alderman defeating an incumbent mayor by stating that it has never happened without considering the potential for future occurrences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why an alderman has never defeated an incumbent mayor, such as the lack of strong opposition or the popularity of incumbent mayors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that an alderman, Emil Seidel, did win a mayoral race in 1910, although he did not defeat a sitting mayor.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its absolute assertion that no alderman has ever defeated an incumbent mayor, as it fails to consider historical examples and potential future scenarios.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the historical trend by stating that it is \"monumental and unprecedented\" without considering other factors that could influence election outcomes."}
