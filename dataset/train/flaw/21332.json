{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Donald Trump defended World War II internment camps lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not outright condemning the World War II detention of Japanese Americans is equivalent to defending the internment camps.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Trump's comparison of his proposed Muslim ban to the actions of Roosevelt was not meant to defend internment camps, but rather to justify his own policy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Trump did not explicitly defend the internment camps, but rather made statements that could be interpreted as not condemning them.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump did not explicitly defend the internment camps.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and direct link between Trump's actions or statements and defending the internment camps.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Trump's stance on internment camps by implying that he actively defended them, when there is no explicit evidence of such defense."}
