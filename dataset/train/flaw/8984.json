{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the improvement in California's homelessness crisis by stating that there are 35,000 fewer homeless people today compared to 2005, without considering the change in counting methodology.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the number of homeless people is solely due to improvement in the crisis, without acknowledging the change in counting criteria.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the comparison between the homeless population in 2005 and the present. The change in counting methodology makes the comparison unreliable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the decrease in the homeless population is a result of changes in counting methods rather than actual improvement in the crisis."}
