{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the nature of the video by describing it as \"offensive\" without providing specific details about the content of the song or the context in which it was played.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or context to support the assertion that the video shows the anchor dancing to an offensive song. It only mentions that a distasteful song is playing in the background without specifying the nature of the song or providing any additional information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is authentic and accurately represents the actions of the anchor. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the original clip was edited and a distasteful song was added, suggesting that the video may have been manipulated or misrepresented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that the original clip shows the anchor dancing and singing happy Diwali, but a slanderous attempt was made to superimpose a distasteful song over it. This suggests that there may be alternative interpretations or motives behind the video's circulation."}
