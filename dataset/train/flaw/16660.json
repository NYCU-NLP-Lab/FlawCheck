{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that packaged vegetables from Mann Packing are being recalled due to concerns about listeria. The expert's verdict mentions a recall by Mann Packing in October 2017, but it does not provide any recent or current information about a recall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that packaged vegetables from Mann Packing are being recalled due to concerns about listeria. However, the expert's verdict states that the recall in October 2017 was in response to a single positive result found during random sampling by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and no wider outbreak of listeria was reported in connection with Mann vegetable products. Therefore, it is possible that the assumption made in the claim is problematic and not supported by the available information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that there have been no reported illnesses associated with the products and no wider outbreak of listeria was reported in connection with Mann vegetable products. The claim implies that there are concerns about listeria in Mann Packing's packaged vegetables, which contradicts the fact that no illnesses or wider outbreak have been reported.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that packaged vegetables from Mann Packing are being recalled due to concerns about listeria. The expert's verdict mentions a recall in October 2017, but it does not provide any recent or current information about a recall. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the extent of the recall.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of faltering at times in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanations in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
