{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Rep. Trey Gowdy has been given the \"highest level of security clearance possible\" through an executive order from the President himself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as there is no evidence or documentation of President Trump signing an executive order granting Rep. Gowdy the highest level of security clearance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. Gowdy has been granted a high level of security clearance based on the false information circulating online.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that members of Congress already have access to classified intelligence reports by virtue of their elected positions, and Rep. Gowdy is also a member of the House intelligence committee."}
