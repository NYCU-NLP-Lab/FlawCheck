{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of COVID-19 loans received by evangelical churches in the US. The actual amount reported by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) was $7.3 billion given to \"religious organizations\" in general, not exclusively to evangelical churches.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that evangelical churches received $7.3 billion in COVID-19 loans. The evidence provided by the expert shows that the loans were given to a wide variety of religious organizations, not just evangelical churches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the $7.3 billion in COVID-19 loans given to religious organizations. It assumes that all of the loans went exclusively to evangelical churches, disregarding the fact that other faith-based recipients also received loans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the $7.3 billion in COVID-19 loans were given to a range of religious organizations, not just evangelical churches. The evidence provided by the expert's verdict shows that the claim is false.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that all religious organizations that received COVID-19 loans were evangelical churches. This assumption is incorrect, as the loans were given to a diverse range of religious organizations, as stated by the expert."}
