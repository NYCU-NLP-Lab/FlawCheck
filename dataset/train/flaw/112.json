{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to prove that the banner with a swastika, \"Trump,\" and \"Pence\" is from a Michigan coronavirus protest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the banner is from a Michigan coronavirus protest without any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not from the Lansing rally but from a different event in Boise, Idaho.", "Exist alternative explanation": "It is not clear from the photo whether the banner was in support of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence or whether it was meant to smear them, suggesting the existence of alternative explanations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the banner by linking it to Nazi sympathizers and suggesting that it represents the views of all Trump supporters at the protest."}
