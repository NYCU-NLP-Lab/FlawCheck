{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the woman's death and her reporting on Robert Mueller destroying text messages. The expert's verdict states that conspiracy theorists are wrongly speculating about her murder based on her critical story about the FBI.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman's death is directly related to her reporting, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a clear causal link between the woman's death and her reporting. The expert's verdict mentions that she died unexpectedly of swine flu and encephalitis, which contradicts the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the woman's death, stating that she died of swine flu and encephalitis, according to her family. This suggests that there may be other factors contributing to her death rather than her reporting."}
