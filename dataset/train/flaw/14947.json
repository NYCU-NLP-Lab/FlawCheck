{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount earned from agricultural exports in the first quarter of 2018. The actual amount earned was N73.24 billion, not N577 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the official data shows a different amount earned from agricultural exports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the N577 billion earned was solely from agricultural exports, which is not accurate as it includes other non-oil exports.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the official data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, which shows a lower amount earned from agricultural exports.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim can be explained as referring to all non-oil exports, including agricultural goods, which totalled N577.6 billion."}
