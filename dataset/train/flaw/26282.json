{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the security risks posed by the Confucius Institute at Mizzou. The letter from the State Department did not explicitly refer to security risks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Confucius Institute presented security risks for students and the university as a whole. The letter from the State Department did not mention security risks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of the Confucius Institute is a direct result of the security risks it posed, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the letter from the State Department was a letter of concern over failures in complying with guidelines, not a warning about security risks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the closure of the Confucius Institute, such as concerns about academic freedom or political influence, which are not addressed in the claim."}
