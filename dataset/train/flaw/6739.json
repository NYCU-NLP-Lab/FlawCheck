{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Farooq Abdullah chanted \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\" after Amit Shah became the Home Minister. The provided evidence indicates that the video is from a previous event unrelated to Amit Shah's appointment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Farooq Abdullah's chanting of \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\" was in response to Amit Shah becoming the Home Minister.
