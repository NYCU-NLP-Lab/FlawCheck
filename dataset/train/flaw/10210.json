{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the video in question does not provide evidence that Obama agreed with Trump on immigration policy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows Obama agreeing with Trump on immigration policy, but the expert's verdict states that the quotes in the video are out of order and out of context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is an alternative explanation for the video, stating that Obama's full speech contains passages that directly contradict the claim made in the video."}
