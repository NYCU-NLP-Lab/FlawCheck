{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Hitler used the slogan \"Make Germany Great Again\" as a campaign slogan, when in fact it was not a recurrent slogan employed by Hitler.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Hitler did occasionally reference the idea of making Germany great again, even if not using the exact phrase as a campaign slogan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Hitler used the specific slogan mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the slogan \"Make Germany Great Again\" used by Hitler is directly comparable to the slogan used by Donald Trump, without providing substantial evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that other politicians, such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, have used similar slogans, suggesting that the concept of making a country great again is not unique to Hitler or Trump."}
