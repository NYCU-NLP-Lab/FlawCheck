{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Santorum campaign did not provide the letter as requested, and it was only obtained later. This lack of immediate support for the claim suggests a potential lack of enough evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that a similar claim was made by John McCain in 2008. This suggests that the assumption that Santorum's claim is unique or exceptional may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the debate on Fannie and Freddie turned into a mudfest, with accusations being thrown between candidates. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Santorum's claim, such as political posturing or deflecting blame."}
