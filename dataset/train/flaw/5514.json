{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential danger of kids being in school during the COVID-19 pandemic by stating that there is \"nothing in the data\" suggesting it is dangerous, while experts acknowledge that there is still some risk involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that kids being in school is not dangerous. Experts highlight that there are still unanswered questions and uncertainties surrounding the transmission of the virus among children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the situation in countries where schools have reopened without problems can be directly applied to the current situation in the United States. However, experts point out that the level of ongoing community transmission in those countries may differ significantly from the current situation in the US.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the lower rates of transmission and severe cases among children. Experts mention that the studies often include children who were more sheltered than usual, raising questions about the potential increase in transmission if schools were to reopen.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been recorded cases of COVID-19 transmission among children and acknowledges that the risk to children is not zero.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration as it presents a definitive statement that there is no danger in kids being in school, while experts highlight the need for caution and the existence of some risk.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not fully acknowledging the uncertainties and limitations of the available data, as well as the ongoing research and evolving understanding of COVID-19 transmission among children."}
