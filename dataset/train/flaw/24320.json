{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which federal taxpayers are subsidizing Amazon's Postal Service deliveries. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence that Amazon is to blame for the Postal Service's deficits, and that the USPS parcel services used by Amazon and other businesses actually raise billions of dollars to cover costs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to prove that federal taxpayers are subsidizing Amazon's Postal Service deliveries. The expert's verdict also mentions that the contract between Amazon and USPS is not publicly available, making it difficult to determine the exact financial arrangement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Amazon's use of USPS services is unfair to the United States and its taxpayers. However, the expert's verdict highlights that USPS is required by law to charge enough to cover the cost of delivering packages for companies like Amazon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the Postal Service's deficits or the financial arrangement with Amazon. The expert's verdict suggests that the USPS parcel services used by Amazon and other businesses are actually contributing to covering institutional costs."}
