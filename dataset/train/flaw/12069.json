{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Mexico shifting all its imports of corn, rice, soy, and wheat from the United States to Argentina by stating that it will take away at least $13 billion annually from American farmers. The expert's verdict clarifies that no such agreement has been signed and the negotiations are focused on a more limited trade deal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Mexico will shift all its imports of grains from the United States to Argentina.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mexico's decision to negotiate a trade deal with Argentina for grains is solely in retaliation for Donald Trump's border wall plan. The expert's verdict points out that the main catalyst for the negotiations is the uncertainty caused by Trump's vow to renegotiate NAFTA.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the negotiations between Mexico and Argentina, stating that they are driven by the uncertainty caused by Trump's vow to renegotiate NAFTA rather than his plans to build a border wall. This suggests that the claim's assumption about the retaliation for the border wall plan may not be accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no agreement like the one described by \"The Other 98%\" has been signed between Mexico and Argentina. The expert's verdict confirms that no such agreement exists.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and limited scope of the trade negotiations between Mexico and Argentina by presenting it as a simple retaliation against Trump's border wall plan. The expert's verdict mentions that the negotiations involve grains and cars, indicating a more comprehensive trade deal.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting inaccurate information, such as stating that Mexico has already established an agricultural agreement with Argentina, when no such agreement has been finalized."}
