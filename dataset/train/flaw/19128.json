{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the details of the incident by stating that the infant screamed for an hour while left alone to die. It is unclear if the duration of the screaming was accurately reported or if it was exaggerated for emotional impact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or verifiable sources to confirm the accuracy of the incident. The information provided is based on anonymous employees cited in a letter sent to prosecutors and a pro-life organization, which may raise questions about the credibility and reliability of the sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident occurred as described and that it was a result of a failed abortion. However, without concrete evidence or further investigation, it is difficult to determine the exact circumstances and causes of the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the incident that are not presented in the claim. The claim focuses on the pro-life perspective and the alleged negligence of medical personnel, but it does not provide a comprehensive view of the situation or consider any potential counterarguments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident has been circulating on pro-life websites since 2016, suggesting that it has been used as a narrative to support certain political or ideological agendas. This raises concerns about the objectivity and potential bias behind the claim."}
