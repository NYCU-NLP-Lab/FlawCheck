{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of other factors on average wages, as it only focuses on the comparison between Walker and Doyle without considering other economic factors that may have influenced wages.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the assertion that average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower under Walker compared to Doyle. The provided statistics are limited and may not provide a comprehensive picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that governors have a significant impact on average wages, but the expert suggests that governors have a limited role in determining wages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in average wages, such as changes in the overall economy or external factors beyond the control of the governor."}
