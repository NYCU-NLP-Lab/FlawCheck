{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear what U.S. Sen. David Perdue's intent was when using the gesture. This suggests that there may not be enough evidence or support to definitively determine his intent.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the hand gesture in question has been adopted as a symbol of white power, but it can also still signify \"OK.\" Therefore, assuming that the gesture is solely a \"white power\" gesture without considering alternative meanings could be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph could be showing Perdue and two volunteers celebrating their achievement of making nearly 3,000 voter contacts each. This alternative explanation suggests that the gesture may not necessarily be related to white power but could represent the number \"three.\"", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that the hand gesture can be used as a symbol for white power but also as an \"OK\" gesture. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the gesture specifically represents \"white power.\"", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the hand gesture is sometimes flashed facetiously, implying that the claim may be understating the possibility of the gesture being used in a non-serious or ironic manner.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the symbol is ambiguous and its meaning can vary depending on the context and intent of the person making the gesture. This suggests that the claim may falter at times by not considering the ambiguity and multiple interpretations of the hand gesture."}
