{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Missouri is the state with the lowest paid workers without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that Sen. Kiki Curls did not respond to requests for background information behind her claim, indicating a lack of supporting evidence for the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that there are three ways to interpret Sen. Curls' words - referring to all workers, private sector workers, or state government workers. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim.", "Understate": "The expert mentions that when considering all workers, Missouri ranks 31st in terms of average weekly wage, which is higher than the state with the lowest paid workers (Mississippi). This suggests that the claim may understate the actual situation in Missouri.", "Contradict fact": "The expert states that Missouri does have the lowest paid state workers based on their average weekly wages, contradicting the claim that Missouri has the lowest paid workers overall.", "Exaggerate": "The expert mentions that Missouri ranks closer to the bottom than the top when considering private sector employees, but it does not rank last. This suggests that the claim may exaggerate the extent to which Missouri has the lowest paid workers."}
