{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that California and New York are \"the two biggest polluting states in the country.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that they are among the top polluting states, but not necessarily the top two.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the governor's press secretary cited a study on energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, but it does not provide any additional data or evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the biggest polluting states automatically makes them responsible for the shortcomings of the U.S. Climate Alliance. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the motive of the governors of California and New York in championing the U.S. Climate Alliance was to distract from their states' shortcomings. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that they are the biggest polluting states solely based on environmental factors."}
