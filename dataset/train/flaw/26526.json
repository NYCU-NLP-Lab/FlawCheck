{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of states that prohibited interracial marriage in 1958. The expert's verdict states that there were actually two dozen states that had such laws, while the claim only mentions 16 states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958. The expert's verdict mentions that the statistic was based on a New York Times article, but it is unclear if the claim itself provides any additional evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prohibition of interracial marriage in 1958 is comparable to the fight for same-sex marriage. This assumption may not be supported by evidence or may be a subjective interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the prohibition of interracial marriage in 1958, such as societal attitudes or historical context. It presents the prohibition as a clear case of discrimination without exploring other factors that may have influenced the laws at the time."}
