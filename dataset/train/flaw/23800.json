{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that \"between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls\" in Wisconsin in 2016 due to the state's voter ID law. However, the evidence provided by the expert suggests that the actual number of deterred voters based on the study was estimated to be 16,801, which is significantly lower than the claim's range.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the studies provided by Clinton's spokesman did not directly support the claim that \"between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls\" in Wisconsin. The study mentioned in the evidence was limited to two counties and warned against extrapolating a statewide estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes an assumption that the voter ID law in Wisconsin was the sole reason for people being turned away from the polls. However, the evidence does not provide a clear link between the voter ID law and the number of people who were deterred from voting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why people may have been turned away from the polls in Wisconsin. The evidence suggests that the impact of the voter ID law alone may not fully explain the number of deterred voters, indicating the possibility of other factors at play.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or facts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any established facts, but it may be considered misleading or exaggerated based on the evidence provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be considered to falter at times as it relies on studies that do not provide strong support for the claim's range of 40,000 to 80,000 people being turned away from the polls in Wisconsin."}
