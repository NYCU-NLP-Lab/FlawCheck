{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to prove that a photograph exists showing Bill Clinton with Jeffrey Epstein.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane and attended a dinner party with him, there must be a photograph of them together. However, this is a problematic assumption as the presence at an event does not necessarily mean a photograph was taken.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the reason the photograph may not be easily found in search engines is that it was not published as a standalone image but embedded in a digital copy of a magazine. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the photograph has been intentionally scrubbed from the internet.", "Contradict fact": "The claim initially states that Google was \"scrubbing\" search results, which the expert's verdict contradicts by stating that Google's search results were not notably different from other search engines.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Clinton's association with Epstein, as mentioned in the expert's verdict, raises questions and warrants further investigation."}
