{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost to Florida taxpayers by stating that it would be $26 billion over 10 years, while alternative estimates suggest it would be closer to $1 billion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the federal plan to expand Medicaid would solely burden Florida taxpayers with the cost, without considering the federal government's offer to cover most of the costs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the $26 billion cost estimate, as it relies on a state analysis that is criticized for its questionable assumptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative estimates and perspectives, such as those provided by outside groups like the Kaiser Family Foundation, which estimate a much lower cost to the state."}
