{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the risk reduction of staying at least 1m away from people by stating that it cuts the risk of catching Covid-19 by 80%. The expert's verdict mentions that the research concluded with a reduction in risk from about 13% to about 3%, which is roughly an 80% reduction, but it is not clear if this reduction applies specifically to Covid-19.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that cutting the distance between people from 2m to 1m might double their risk of catching Covid-19, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or references to the research in the Lancet that supports the 80% risk reduction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that staying at least 1m away from people is the only factor that affects the risk of catching Covid-19, without considering other factors such as wearing masks or eye protection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the risk reduction, such as wearing masks or eye protection, which the expert's verdict mentions as potential factors that can substantially lower the risk."}
