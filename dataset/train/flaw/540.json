{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Bernie Sanders' involvement in the Socialist Workers Party and wrongly suggests that he labeled some of the hostages as CIA spies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Bernie Sanders supported Ayatollah Khomeini against the US, condemned President Carter for imperialism, and accused the hostages of being CIA spies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bernie Sanders' support for the Socialist Workers Party means he supported Ayatollah Khomeini and accused the hostages of being CIA spies, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Bernie Sanders' support for the Socialist Workers Party does not necessarily mean he supported Ayatollah Khomeini and accused the hostages of being CIA spies."}
