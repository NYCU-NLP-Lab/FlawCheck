{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which \"all personal issues\" of constituents will be made public under Clean Missouri. The expert's verdict suggests that the law applies to legislative records, including electronic ones, but does not specifically mention emails. Each legislator will have the discretion to decide if they classify emails as legislative records.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that constituents will face the reality of all their personal issues being made public, without considering the nuances and discretion involved in determining what constitutes legislative records.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that \"all personal issues\" will be made public. It relies on a tweet from State Rep. Jean Evans, but the expert's verdict suggests that the scope of what will be made public is not clearly defined.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives on the issue. It presents the assertion as a fact without acknowledging potential counterarguments or differing interpretations of the law."}
