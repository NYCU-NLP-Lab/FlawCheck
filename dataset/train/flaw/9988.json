{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of new Twitter followers President Trump gained in three days.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that most of the new followers are bots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in followers is unusual and implies that it is due to bots, without providing substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the phenomenon of gaining fake followers is not specific to President Trump and other accounts with larger followings have experienced similar patterns."}
