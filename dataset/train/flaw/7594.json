{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no pending federal investigation or imminent indictment of the Obama Foundation by the U.S. Department of Justice.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the foundation is being investigated for racketeering, when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based solely on a fake news article from the Patriot Post, which is known for publishing satire and fictional content.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the foundation is involved in illegal activities without any credible evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the controversy surrounding the Obama Foundation concerns the location of a parking garage on the Obama Presidential Center campus, not racketeering."}
