{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the number of customers outside the United States' borders by stating that \"95 percent of the world's customers are over there.\" This may create an impression that the majority of potential customers for American products are outside the country, when in reality, the majority of people across the world may not have the purchasing power to buy American products.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of customers outside the United States is a relevant factor in discussing international trade. However, it fails to consider the purchasing power and economic conditions of those customers, which are crucial factors in determining the potential market for American products.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"95 percent of the world's customers are beyond our shores.\" It does not provide specific sources or studies to back up this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the alternative explanation that while a significant portion of the world's population may be located outside the United States, not all of them have the means or desire to purchase American products. This alternative explanation challenges the assumption made in the claim."}
