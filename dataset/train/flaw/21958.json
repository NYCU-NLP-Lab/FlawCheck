{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Covid-19 vaccine by stating that 80% of the nuns in the Kentucky convent contracted Covid-19 after receiving the Moderna vaccine. The expert's verdict clarifies that the events at the monastery are not evidence that immunization is ineffective against the disease.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not mentioning the third death in the monastery, despite being published more than two weeks after the incident. This omission raises questions about the accuracy and completeness of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct causal link between the Moderna vaccine and the contraction of Covid-19 by the nuns. The expert's verdict highlights that the articles are part of a trend of misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines spreading across the internet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct cause-effect relationship between the vaccination and the contraction of Covid-19, without considering other factors that could have contributed to the spread of the virus in the monastery.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the nuns were already sick before being vaccinated, and one sister had tested positive for Covid-19 before the vaccination took place. This suggests that the vaccine may not be the sole cause of the Covid-19 cases in the monastery."}
