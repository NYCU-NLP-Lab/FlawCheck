{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Georgia's per-capita spending being the lowest in the nation, as it only excludes South Dakota.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the state's per-capita spending, as it does not provide enough context or data to support the statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to validate the assertion of having the lowest per-capita spending, except for South Dakota.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that per-capita spending is the sole indicator of whether a state is spending too much or too little, without considering other factors or variables.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to Georgia's per-capita spending, such as cost of living, which is not addressed in the claim."}
