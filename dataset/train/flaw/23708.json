{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide any additional evidence or sources to support the claim that a Romney adviser admitted Romneycare was the blueprint for Obamacare. It only cites a transcript from rushlimbaugh.com, which is not an independent or reliable source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Jonathan Gruber, a consultant on Romney's health care reform and an MIT economist, is an admission that Romneycare was the blueprint for Obamacare. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any analysis or context to determine if Gruber's statement can be interpreted as an admission.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore any alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the relationship between Romneycare and Obamacare. It only focuses on the statement made by Jonathan Gruber and does not consider other factors or influences that may have contributed to the similarities between the two health care laws."}
