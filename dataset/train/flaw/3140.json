{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates McCain's attempt to have it both ways on Iraq by suggesting that he has been a longtime critic of the administration while advocating for a sustained military presence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which McCain has supported President Bush's overall war policy and offered optimistic predictions about the outcome in Iraq.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by oversimplifying the facts and making comparisons that may not be entirely accurate, such as equating opposing U.S. involvement in Iraq with opposing the war on terrorism.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support in terms of providing specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that McCain is trying to have it both ways on Iraq.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain's attempt to distinguish himself from the president on Iraq is solely motivated by political reasons, without considering other possible motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for McCain's actions, such as changes in his stance over time or evolving perspectives on the situation in Iraq."}
