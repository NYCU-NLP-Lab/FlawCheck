{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that November 2018 marked the first Veterans Day in 56 years upon which the sitting U.S. president did not attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. This is not accurate as there have been other instances where presidents did not attend such ceremonies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that it was the first time in 56 years that a president did not attend the wreath-laying ceremony.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the president at the wreath-laying ceremony is significant and implies a lack of respect for veterans. However, the expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the president's absence, such as travel complications and other engagements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the president's absence on Veterans Day, such as travel complications caused by heavy rain and other commemoration events the president attended. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the president's actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been other instances, as listed by the expert's verdict, where sitting U.S. presidents did not attend Veterans Day wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery."}
