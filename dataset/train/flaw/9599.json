{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that \"more children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry.\" The available data only provides information on the number of child labor deaths in the agriculture industry, without comparing it to other industries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of child labor deaths is the only factor to consider when assessing the safety of children working in agriculture. It does not take into account other potential risks or safety measures in place.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Lawmakers in the article suggest alternative explanations for the claim, such as the possibility that more children work in agriculture than in other industries, which could contribute to a higher number of deaths.", "Falters at times": "The claim is challenged by other lawmakers who question its accuracy and present counterarguments, suggesting that the claim may have weaknesses or inconsistencies.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of child labor deaths in other industries by solely focusing on the agriculture industry.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the number of child labor deaths in the agriculture industry."}
