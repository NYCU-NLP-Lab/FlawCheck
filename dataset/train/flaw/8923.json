{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the bill by stating that ISPs will spy on what type of underwear individuals buy and sell that data to advertisers. While ISPs can see their customers' online purchases, the claim implies that this is a new capability enabled by the bill, which is an exaggeration.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that ISPs already have access to their customers' online purchases and can sell that information. It implies that this is a new development resulting from the bill, whereas ISPs already had this capability.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that 215 members of Congress voted to allow ISPs to spy on underwear purchases and sell that data to advertisers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bill enables ISPs to engage in spying on underwear purchases, while in reality, ISPs can already see their customers' online activities, including purchases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the bill simply removes the requirement for ISPs to obtain explicit permission before sharing customer data with advertisers and other third parties. It does not necessarily mean that ISPs will actively spy on underwear purchases or sell that specific data to advertisers."}
