{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the World Health Organization (WHO) by stating that they admitted PCR tests are resulting in widespread false positives. The WHO actually advises labs to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended by the manufacturer, which is different from reducing the number of amplification cycles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a Facebook post and a tweet by a doctor and Newsmax TV pundit as evidence. The tweet is no longer available, making it difficult to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current PCR cycle count is grossly inflating case numbers and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case. However, there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the WHO does not ask to reduce the number of amplification cycles in PCR tests, but advises labs to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended by the manufacturer.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information about the WHO's guidance on PCR testing and amplification cycles. It misrepresents the purpose of the WHO's note and the actions they recommend to labs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim may be based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the WHO's guidance on PCR testing and the purpose of amplification cycles."}
