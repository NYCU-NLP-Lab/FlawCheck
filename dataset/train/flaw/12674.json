{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Ted Cruz's change in position on birthright citizenship. The expert's verdict indicates that while Cruz has shifted his talk about birthright citizenship, it is not in the way Rubio described on national television.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that Ted Cruz used to be in favor of birthright citizenship but is now against it. The expert's verdict mentions that the full interview from 2011 is not available, so it is unclear what else Cruz may have said on the subject during that time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sen. Ted Cruz's change in position on birthright citizenship is significant and noteworthy. However, the expert's verdict suggests that Cruz's shift in talk about birthright citizenship may not align with Rubio's characterization of it as a complete flip-flop.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that Sen. Ted Cruz's stance on birthright citizenship may have evolved or been refined over time, rather than completely changing. The expert's verdict indicates that Cruz has shifted his talk about birthright citizenship, but it is not clear if this constitutes a complete reversal of his previous position."}
