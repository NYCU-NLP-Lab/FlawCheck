{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the banner in Pakistan's women's march targets Prophet Mohammed and his wife, Hazrat Ayesha, based on the text on the banner. However, there is no concrete evidence or identification of the person who made the banner.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the banner was intended as a criticism of Prophet Mohammed and Hazrat Ayesha. The only evidence provided is the text on the banner, which is not enough to establish the intention or motive behind it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the official statement by Aurat March Lahore, which states that the story shared in the banner is about a woman in Lahore who experienced sexual abuse at the hands of a religious teacher when she was 9 years old. This contradicts the claim's assertion that the banner targets Prophet Mohammed and Hazrat Ayesha.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance and impact of the banner by stating that the Prophet Mohammed's voice is still heard in mosques till this day. This statement may be an exaggeration to create a stronger emotional response.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and captions to support its assertion. Social media can be a platform for misinformation and unreliable sources, making the claim's evidence questionable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by the official statement of Aurat March Lahore, which states that the banner is about a personal experience of sexual abuse and not a direct criticism of Prophet Mohammed and Hazrat Ayesha. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's interpretation of the banner's intention."}
