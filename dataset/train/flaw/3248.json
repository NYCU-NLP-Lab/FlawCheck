{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the photograph used to support the claim is not from JFK's inaugural parade but from the 1940s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because previous presidents' inaugural parades included military hardware, it is acceptable to have tanks in a parade during peacetime. This assumption is problematic as it doesn't consider the specific context and concerns raised by critics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photograph used in the claim, which is that it is from the 1940s and not from JFK's inaugural parade.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph used is not from JFK's inaugural parade.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of JFK's inaugural parade by comparing it to the controversial \"Salute to America\" parade in 2019."}
