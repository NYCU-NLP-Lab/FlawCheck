{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a list of viral outbreaks without providing comprehensive data or evidence to support the claim that most viral outbreaks between 1950 and 2019 started in China.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the origin of a viral outbreak determines its prevalence or impact. However, the claim fails to consider other factors such as global travel and transmission patterns that can contribute to the spread of viral outbreaks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some of the viral outbreaks listed were first reported outside of China. For example, H2N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses were first reported in Singapore and the United States respectively.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of other countries in the origin and spread of viral outbreaks by focusing solely on China. It fails to acknowledge that viral outbreaks can originate from various regions around the world.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origin of viral outbreaks, such as natural reservoirs or cross-species transmission, which can occur in any country and not necessarily be limited to China.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing accurate information about the origin of certain viral outbreaks. For example, it incorrectly states that swine flu originated in China when it was first reported in the US.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of China in viral outbreaks by suggesting that most viral outbreaks originated from there without providing sufficient evidence or context."}
