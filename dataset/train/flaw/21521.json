{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo shows a man desecrating the Indian flag in West Bengal in 2020, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the photo is indeed from West Bengal in 2020 and shows a man desecrating the Indian flag.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photo has been previously published in 2018 with a different context, indicating that there could be an alternative explanation for the image.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the claim is misleading and provides evidence that the photo is not from 2020 but from 2018, and the man was arrested for disrespecting the national flag wearing a Pakistani flag.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the seriousness of the incident by implying that the police are discouraged from arresting such people since independence, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
