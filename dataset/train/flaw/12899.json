{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the potential impact of Measures 82 and 83 by stating that they authorize just one more casino. The expert's verdict explains that Measure 82 does not put a limit on the number of new private casinos allowed, so there could be more than one casino established if investors meet the criteria.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Measures 82 and 83 only authorize one more casino without considering the potential for additional casinos to be established if they meet the specified criteria.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that Measures 82 and 83 authorize just one more casino. The expert's verdict provides additional information and context to explain the complexity of the measures and the potential for multiple casinos.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the authorization of new casinos. The expert's verdict explains that if investors meet the criteria, they could potentially open a casino in another location besides Wood Village.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or errors in the claim."}
