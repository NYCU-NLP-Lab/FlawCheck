{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Donald Trump's IQ is 156 is not supported by sufficient evidence or data. The expert explains that the claim is based on an estimation made by a website, which is not a reliable source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that IQ is the sole measure of intelligence and compares it to the intelligence of past U.S. presidents. This assumption overlooks the complexity and multidimensionality of intelligence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the omission of President Barack Obama from the chart, stating that it was due to the data being compiled before Obama took office, rather than his IQ being low.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that IQ scores were not available for most of the presidents, and the chart is based on estimations using variables correlated with IQ.", "Understate": "The claim may understate or oversimplify the process of measuring IQ by suggesting that it can be accurately derived from known SAT scores.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on an estimation made by a website and not providing solid evidence or a reliable source for the IQ score.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim itself does not necessarily exaggerate, the chart and the assertion that Trump would rank among the smartest U.S. presidents may be seen as an exaggeration, considering the lack of available IQ scores for most presidents."}
