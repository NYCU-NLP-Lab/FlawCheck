{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the issue by stating that \"various restaurants around the world were shut down for serving human meat,\" when in reality, there is only one reported incident mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that restaurants were shut down for serving human meat. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on rumors and unreliable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported incident of a restaurant serving human meat is true, without providing concrete evidence or verification.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented in the expert's verdict, which states that the original article published by BBC Swahili was incorrect and based on a mistake.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of credibility and reliability due to the lack of verifiable information and the inconsistencies in the reported incidents across different locations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that the rumor may have originated from a combination of a genuine report about skulls being discovered in a Nigerian hotel room and a poorly sourced tabloid story about a restaurant serving human meat."}
