{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the specific date of April 2 as the day when a woman has to work all last year and up until that day to earn the same as a white man doing the same job. The expert's verdict clarifies that April 2 is actually Equal Pay Day for women in general, not specifically for white men.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender pay gap is solely based on race and workers doing the same job. The expert's verdict explains that Equal Pay Day is not based on race, but rather on the gap in annual earnings between female and male workers in general.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statement that April 2 is the specific day when a woman has to work all last year and up until that day to earn the same as a white man doing the same job. The expert's verdict provides data from the Census Bureau to calculate the gender pay gap, which indicates that a woman earning the median amount would have to work 91 days into the year to earn the same amount a man at the median level made last year alone.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that April 2 is not specifically about white men, but rather about the gender pay gap in general. The expert's verdict clarifies that Equal Pay Day is not focused on white men, but on the overall gender income gap.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the date of April 2. The expert's verdict suggests that Gillibrand may have confused the observance on April 2 with other dates that symbolize how far into the year women in designated groups have to work to earn what white men earned in the previous year.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim."}
