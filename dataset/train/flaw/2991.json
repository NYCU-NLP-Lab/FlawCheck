{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential consequences of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stating that it would grant Obama \"the powers of a king\" and result in the loss of America's borders, Constitution, and rule of law.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership by suggesting that it won't receive a committee assignment and there will be no debate, which is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that the Trans-Pacific Partnership won't receive a committee assignment and there will be no debate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that fast-tracking the Trans-Pacific Partnership through the Senate would automatically result in no committee assignment and no debate, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its potential implications."}
