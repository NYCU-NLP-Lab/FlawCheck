{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the coronavirus lives for 12 hours on metal and 9 hours on fabric lacks sufficient scientific evidence or research to support it. The expert's verdict mentions that no research was conducted on fabric at all, and there is no mention of specific studies or sources supporting the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that washing hands with soap and water is enough to kill the virus on metal surfaces and that washing clothes or exposing them to the sun for two hours is sufficient to kill the virus on fabric. However, there is no scientific evidence or research provided to support these assumptions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of the research mentioned in the expert's verdict. The research suggests that the virus can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as 2-3 days, with different survival times on different materials. The claim's specific timeframes for the virus's lifespan on metal and fabric do not align with the research findings.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential lifespan of the virus on certain surfaces. The research mentioned in the expert's verdict indicates that the virus can survive on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 2-3 days, which is longer than the claim's stated 12 hours on metal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may affect the lifespan of the virus on different surfaces. The research mentioned in the expert's verdict suggests that the virus's survival time can vary depending on factors such as the type of surface, humidity, temperature, and the presence of other substances.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the effectiveness of prolonged sun exposure in killing the virus. The expert's verdict mentions that no research was conducted on the specific claim of sun exposure for two hours reducing the half-life of the virus. Therefore, the claim's statement about sun exposure killing the virus for 12 hours may be an exaggeration without sufficient evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and reliable information about the virus's lifespan on different surfaces. It combines unverified claims from social media with incomplete or unsupported information, which can lead to confusion or misinformation."}
