{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of face masks in curbing the spread of COVID-19 by stating that the transmission rate can drop to 1.5% if both parties wear masks, without sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence to support the statistics cited in the graphic, according to Professor Benjamin John Cowling.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all types of masks would work in curbing the spread of COVID-19, without considering the variations in effectiveness between different types of masks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19, apart from the use of face masks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that neither the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nor the World Health Organization (WHO) have published official statistics about the effectiveness of face masks in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic."}
