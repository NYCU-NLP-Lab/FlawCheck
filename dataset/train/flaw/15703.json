{"Understate": "The claim understates the extent of family separations under the Trump administration compared to previous administrations. Experts argue that there was no blanket policy to prosecute parents and separate them from their children under Obama and Bush, unlike the current administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the Obama and Bush administrations separated families to the same extent as the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security could not provide statistics on how many children were separated from their parents under Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because previous administrations separated families to some degree, it justifies the mass separation of families under the current administration. However, experts argue that the scale and policy approach of the Trump administration's family separations are different.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the current administration's family separations, such as the implementation of a \"zero tolerance policy\" on illegal immigration that refers all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution. This policy contributes to the separation of parents and children."}
