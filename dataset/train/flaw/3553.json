{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documentation to support the assertion that women gathered to \"scream\" at President Trump through their vaginas. No documentary information or credible sources are provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph accurately depicts women screaming at President Trump through their vaginas, without providing any verifiable proof or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photograph has been attributed to various alternative explanations, such as the \"raising your skirt for diversity\" trend or an art project exploring women's relationships with their bodies. This suggests that there are alternative interpretations for the image, undermining the claim's specific assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph has been circulating since at least February 2016, well before President Trump was elected. This contradicts the claim's implication that the event depicted in the photograph is a direct response to President Trump.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the controversy or significance of the alleged event by simply stating that women gathered to \"scream\" at President Trump through their vaginas. It does not provide any further details or context to fully understand the nature or purpose of the gathering.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim itself does not necessarily exaggerate the event, the use of provocative language in the accompanying text (e.g., \"disgusting feminists,\" \"sick act\") may be seen as an attempt to exaggerate or sensationalize the alleged event."}
