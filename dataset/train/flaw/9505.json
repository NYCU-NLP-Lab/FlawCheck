{"Contradict fact": "There is a contradiction between the claim that Scott Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating and Walker's denial of being forced out of school.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting documentation to verify the GPA and the reason for Walker leaving Marquette University.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Walker's alleged low GPA and expulsion for cheating are directly related to his current stance on attacking teachers, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Walker leaving Marquette University, such as his job offer from the American Red Cross, which he claims influenced his decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing consistent and reliable information, as there are conflicting accounts and statements regarding Walker's academic performance and departure from Marquette University.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate or oversimplify the complexities and circumstances surrounding Walker's academic history and the reasons for his departure from Marquette University.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim; however, the use of the meme with a dunce cap on Walker's head could be seen as an attempt to exaggerate his academic shortcomings."}
