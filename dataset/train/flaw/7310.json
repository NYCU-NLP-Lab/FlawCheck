{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that Terry McAuliffe wants to raise taxes by $1,700 to pay for his promises without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this specific amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence about the promises made by Terry McAuliffe that would result in a $1,700 tax increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of Terry McAuliffe's promises would require a tax increase of $1,700, which may be a problematic assumption without further evidence or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Terry McAuliffe's plans and their potential fiscal impact that are not explored or considered in the claim."}
