{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the KKK marched on a bridge in North Carolina to celebrate Donald Trump's presidential victory. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the people in the picture were not associated with the KKK and were instead conservative Trump supporters.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the KKK marched on a bridge to celebrate Trump's victory, when in reality, they had a separate victory parade planned for a later date.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a grainy picture and does not provide any additional evidence to prove that the KKK was actually marching on the bridge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the people in the picture, who were carrying American, Gadsden, and Christian flags, were members of the KKK. This assumption is problematic as it is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the situation, stating that the people in the picture were conservative Trump supporters and not affiliated with the KKK."}
