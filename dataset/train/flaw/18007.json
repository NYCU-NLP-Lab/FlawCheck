{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"doubling our use of renewable energy\" is an exaggeration because the increase in renewable energy generation is actually 55 percent, not double.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it only focuses on wind and solar energy, ignoring other types of renewable energy such as hydroelectric and geothermal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that \"doubling our use of renewable energy\" refers to all types of energy production, including coal, oil, and natural gas, when it actually only refers to renewable energy production.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations, such as the increase in renewable energy being driven by government policies and incentives rather than a specific effort by the Obama administration."}
