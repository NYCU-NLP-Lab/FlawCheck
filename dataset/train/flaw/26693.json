The ad does not provide sufficient details about the tax deal, leaving it open to interpretation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax deal would let Beckham's stadium off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years. However, the ad does not provide concrete evidence or a clear explanation of how this figure was determined.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the tax deal. It presents the tax deal as a negative aspect without exploring potential benefits or justifications for it.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Beckham announced he would drop the port site in favor of a site downtown, but the tax deal mentioned in the ad still exists regardless of the site. This contradicts the claim that the tax deal is specific to the port site.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the tax deal by stating that Beckham would be \"off the hook\" for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years. The ad does not provide enough information to fully evaluate the extent of the tax benefits or exemptions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tax deal and its implications.
