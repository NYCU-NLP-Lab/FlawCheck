{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between disease outbreaks and election years by stating that \"every election year has a disease\" and listing multiple diseases that occurred in specific election years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that disease outbreaks are directly linked to election years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between disease outbreaks and election years without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the occurrence of disease outbreaks, such as the fact that most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that SARS, avian flu, and MERS had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years, while the claim implies a direct connection between these diseases and specific election years.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of some diseases by not acknowledging their significance outside of election years, such as the avian flu which was described as a pandemic before the 2008 presidential election and continues to be a problem today.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the timeline of disease outbreaks and their connection to election years, as pointed out by the expert's verdict."}
