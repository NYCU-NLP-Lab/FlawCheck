However, the expert's verdict suggests that the southern route around Africa is widely used for shipping regardless of a ship being stuck in the Suez.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the increased traffic around the Cape of Good Hope, stating that shipping companies have diverted vessels to take the old-fashioned way around Africa due to the Suez Canal blockage."}
