{"Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by data from a 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, which confirms the 500 percent higher death rate from asthma for African-American children compared to white children. Additionally, a more recent study from 2014 further supports the claim by showing that black children are about 7.2 times more likely to die of asthma than white children. Therefore, the claim does not lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption evident in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the issue of asthma-related deaths in African-American children. In fact, the more recent study from 2014 suggests that the problem may be even more severe than initially stated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the expert's verdict that challenges the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim is supported by factual data from the 2006 CDC study and the 2014 study, so it does not contradict any known facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the issue of asthma-related deaths in African-American children, as it is supported by multiple studies.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times. The data from the studies consistently supports the claim."}
