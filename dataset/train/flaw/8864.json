{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which traffic lanes would be removed and replaced with lanes dedicated to bicycles and buses. The expert's verdict mentions that not all identified changes would happen right away and that the $482 million bond would only cover a portion of the corridor projects.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that removing traffic lanes and replacing them with lanes for bicycles and buses will not help ease congestion. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the proposed spending on transportation will ultimately relieve traffic congestion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that 27+ miles of traffic lanes will be removed and replaced with lanes for bicycles and buses. The expert's verdict mentions that the count of lost miles of traffic lanes was drawn from research by the Travis County Taxpayers Association, but it does not provide further details or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the removal of traffic lanes, such as the creation of raised medians and turn bays. The expert's verdict mentions that more than half of the lane reductions would be for raised medians and turn bays, not just for buses and bicycles.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not fully considering the details and complexities of the transportation plans and the impact on traffic lanes. The expert's verdict provides additional information and clarifications about the proposed changes and their scope.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential benefits of the transportation plans, as it focuses on the negative impact of removing traffic lanes without considering the potential improvements in traffic flow and congestion relief. The expert's verdict mentions that the proposed spending aims to relieve traffic congestion all over."}
