{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the education cuts made by Thom Tillis by stating that he \"cut almost $500 million from education.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the state education budget actually increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the education cuts were solely the responsibility of Thom Tillis, without considering other factors or individuals involved in the budget allocation process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Thom Tillis specifically cut almost $500 million from education. The expert's verdict provides information about the state education budget and the allocation process, indicating that the claim may not have enough support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the education cuts were a result of a divided political landscape in North Carolina, with Democrats criticizing the budget primarily for inadequate education allocations. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Tillis was solely responsible for the cuts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state education budget increased every year since Tillis became speaker, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the education cuts by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the overall education spending per pupil in North Carolina and how it compares to other states.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the education budget and the specific actions taken by Thom Tillis in relation to education funding. The expert's verdict highlights the complexity of the budget allocation process and the involvement of multiple stakeholders."}
