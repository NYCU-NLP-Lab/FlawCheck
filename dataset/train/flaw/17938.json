{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the deficit by stating it as a \"plummet into such a deep hole\" just six years after Cianci left office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the direct correlation between Cianci leaving office and the $110 million deficit in 2008.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deficit in 2008 was solely a result of the absence of leadership after Cianci left office, without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the deficit in 2008, such as economic downturn or mismanagement by subsequent mayors, which are not explored in the claim."}
