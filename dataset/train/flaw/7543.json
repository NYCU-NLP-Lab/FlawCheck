{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton received her questions for the first presidential debate of 2016 a week in advance. The only source mentioned is a fake news article from the Baltimore Gazette, which is not a legitimate news organization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fake news article from the Baltimore Gazette is true and presents it as evidence, despite the fact that it has been debunked and is not a reliable source.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning legitimate news outlets, such as the Washington Post, which reported on Clinton's meticulous debate preparation. This suggests that Clinton's strong debate performance could be attributed to her thorough preparation rather than receiving the questions in advance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fake news article from the Baltimore Gazette is not a legitimate source and has been debunked.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the alleged event by suggesting that it impacted the fairness of the debate and Clinton's performance without providing substantial evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in the provided claim."}
