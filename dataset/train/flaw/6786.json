The expert's verdict indicates that the actual number is higher, with nearly 130,000 homeless people in the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the homelessness crisis in California, but the expert's verdict mentions that the state's high cost of living and lack of affordable housing contribute to the problem."}
