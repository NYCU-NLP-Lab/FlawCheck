{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the health care reform law reduces the deficit by nearly $1.2 trillion over the next two decades is supported by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis for the first 10 years, but the projection for the next decade is described as speculative. Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support for the claim beyond the first 10 years.", "Falters at times": "The CBO states that a detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019 would not be meaningful due to significant uncertainties. This suggests that the claim may falter at times when trying to predict the impact of the health care reform law on the deficit beyond the initial 10-year period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim attributes the deficit reduction solely to the health care reform law, the CBO acknowledges that there are numerous factors that could affect the deficit, including changes in people's health, insurance coverage, medical advancements, and physicians' practice patterns. This suggests that there may exist alternative explanations for the projected deficit reduction."}
