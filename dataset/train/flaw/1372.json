{"Contradict fact": "The claim that photographs show over a thousand mail-in ballots discovered in a California landfill is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the items shown in the photographs were not ballots, were not from 2020, and were not illegally discarded.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it implies that a significant number of mail-in ballots were found in a landfill, when in reality, the items in the photographs were empty envelopes from a previous election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence that the photographs do not actually show mail-in ballots from the 2020 election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs depict mail-in ballots from the 2020 election, which is a problematic assumption since the expert's verdict confirms that they are actually empty envelopes from a previous election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photographs, such as the possibility that they are not related to the 2020 election at all, as supported by the expert's verdict."}
