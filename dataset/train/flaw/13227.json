{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of flu deaths, stating that sometimes over 100,000 people die from the flu each year, while the average number of flu deaths is about 36,000.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that COVID-19 is estimated to be about 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that COVID-19 is far less lethal than the flu in most populations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because we have learned to live with the flu, we can also learn to live with COVID-19, without considering the differences in their severity and impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in lethality between the flu and COVID-19, such as the age-specific risks and the different patterns of the two diseases."}
