{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential job creation impact of Bank of America's 2010 bonuses. It states that the bonuses could create 878,300 jobs with benefits, which is an inflated number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that Bank of America's bonuses could create such a large number of jobs. It is based on a report by a coalition of groups, but the methodology and reasoning behind the calculation are not clearly explained.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Bank of America spent its 2010 bonuses on job creation, it would directly result in the creation of 878,300 jobs. This assumption overlooks the complexities and dynamics of job creation in the economy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to job creation or economic growth. It solely focuses on the impact of redirecting bonuses, without considering other potential strategies or factors that could influence job creation."}
