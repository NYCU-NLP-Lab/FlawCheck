{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden \"handed the grid to China\" through his Keystone Pipeline executive order. There is no evidence to support this extreme claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a Facebook post and links to unrelated documents as evidence. There is no credible evidence provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the executive order lifted the security on the U.S. power grid for 90 days, but there is no evidence or explanation provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the Texas power outages, such as the extreme weather conditions and infrastructure issues, which are not considered in the claim."}
