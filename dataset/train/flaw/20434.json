{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the information provided by The New York Times, as it states that the story does not have any information that says Mr. Trump did not pay taxes, while the Times reported that the loss could have allowed Trump to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details to back up its assertion that The New York Times does not have any information stating that Mr. Trump did not pay taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of information in The New York Times story means that Mr. Trump did not pay taxes. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lack of information in The New York Times story, such as the information not being included or available in the three pages of tax returns obtained by the Times."}
