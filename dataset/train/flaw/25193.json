{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of post-Brexit trade deals with the EU on job losses. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence for the estimated job losses reported in the government analysis or wider research, suggesting that the claim may be understating the potential job losses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the government analysis on which the claim is based explicitly states that it is not a forecast for what will actually happen. This lack of support indicates that the claim may not have sufficient evidence to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that post-Brexit trade deals with the EU will lead to a specific range of job losses. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the government analysis used for the claim is based on hypothetical modeling and should not be used to make economic forecasts. Therefore, the claim's assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the potential job losses resulting from post-Brexit trade deals with the EU. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations either. Therefore, it is unclear if this bias exists in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not explicitly contradict any facts mentioned in the expert's verdict. Therefore, this bias does not exist in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the potential job losses resulting from post-Brexit trade deals with the EU. The range of 700,000 to 2,800,000 fewer jobs is based on the government analysis. Therefore, this bias does not exist in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it consistently presents the range of job losses resulting from post-Brexit trade deals with the EU. Therefore, this bias does not exist in the claim."}
