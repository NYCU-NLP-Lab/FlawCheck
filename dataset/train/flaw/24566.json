{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the health risks posed by immigration across the southern U.S. border by suggesting that an immigrant crossed with a case of smallpox, when in fact the photograph showed a man with scabies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or factual support to prove that an immigrant crossed with a case of smallpox.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph of a man with scabies represents a case of smallpox, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph actually shows a case of scabies, not smallpox.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using a photograph from a specific outbreak in 2014 to support a generalization about the health risks of immigration across the southern border.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the health conditions observed among immigrants, such as the possibility of diseases being brought by other means or factors unrelated to immigration."}
