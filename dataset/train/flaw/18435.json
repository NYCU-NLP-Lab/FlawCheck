{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the threat posed by praying mantises to hummingbirds by stating that they \"successfully capture, kill, and eat\" hummingbirds. While it is true that there have been documented cases of praying mantises preying on hummingbirds, it is not a common occurrence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photograph shows a praying mantis after it killed a hummingbird. The expert's verdict mentions that the image is legitimate and was originally published by National Geographic, but it does not provide any additional evidence or analysis to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph depicts a praying mantis after it killed a hummingbird, without considering alternative explanations or possibilities. The expert's verdict mentions that mantids may hang around hummingbird feeders to catch bees and wasps, and if hungry enough, they may decide to attack a hummingbird. This suggests that there could be other reasons for the mantis's presence near the hummingbird feeder.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that mantids may hang around hummingbird feeders to catch bees and wasps, which suggests an alternative explanation for the mantis's presence near the hummingbird feeder. This alternative explanation challenges the assumption made in the claim that the mantis killed the hummingbird.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or downplay the significance of the photograph.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times or show inconsistency in its presentation of information."}
