{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the rodent infestation problem at the restaurant by stating that it has a \"long-standing problem\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence from the health code records to substantiate the assertion of a long-standing problem with rodent infestations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of \"areas that would allow the entry of rodents\" is equivalent to a rodent infestation problem, without considering alternative explanations or the severity of the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of areas that would allow the entry of rodents, such as structural vulnerabilities or temporary issues that may have been addressed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the restaurant has had \"no critical violations observed\" in nine out of the 18 inspections since 2006, including the four most recent ones. This suggests that the claim's assertion of a long-standing problem with rodent infestations may be inaccurate.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the severity of the issue by not acknowledging that the restaurant has never been cited for evidence of rodents on the premises or for any infestation in the past decade.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the restaurant's health code records and selectively focusing on certain violations without considering the overall inspection history."}
