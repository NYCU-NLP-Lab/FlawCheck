{"Understate": "The claim may understate McCain's support for increased education funding, stronger accountability standards, and a more powerful Education Department by focusing on one instance of voting to cut education funding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that McCain voted to cut education funding, against accountability standards, and proposed abolishing the Department of Education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain's voting record on education accurately reflects his stance on the issue, without considering other factors or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for McCain's votes, such as the budget wars between President Clinton and the Republican majority in Congress, which may have influenced the decision to cut education funding temporarily."}
