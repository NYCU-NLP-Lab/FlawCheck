{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the rising trend of Americans without a religious affiliation, which has quadrupled over a 40-year span.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient data and evidence to support the assertion that faith is gaining new life across America every day.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that while religious practice on the more intense end of the spectrum has held its own, the share of Americans with lower levels of described religiousness has steadily declined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the consistent percentage of Americans with a \"strong\" religious affiliation indicates that religion in America is not receding, without considering the significant increase in Americans without a religious affiliation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the share of Americans without a religious affiliation has risen, which suggests a decline in religious influence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that faith is gaining new life across America every day, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by overlooking notable nuances in the long-running data on religion in the United States, specifically the trend of weaker religious individuals choosing a stronger religious identity or none at all."}
