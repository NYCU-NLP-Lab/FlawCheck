{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Ed Gillespie was paid $300,000 specifically to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan. However, the evidence provided only shows that Gillespie was involved with the coalition and registered as a lobbyist for them.", "Lack enough support": "While there is evidence of Gillespie's involvement with the coalition, there is no direct evidence or documentation provided to support the claim that he was paid $300,000 for his role.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gillespie's involvement with the coalition and his registration as a lobbyist for them automatically means that he supported the individual mandate. However, Gillespie's campaign has consistently stated that he has always been opposed to the individual mandate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that Gillespie's involvement with the coalition and his registration as a lobbyist may have been for reasons other than supporting the individual mandate, such as providing strategic advice or representing the coalition's interests in other areas."}
