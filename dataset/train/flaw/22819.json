{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the proposed fast-track legislation on overriding domestic financial rules. The expert's verdict highlights that the legislation could potentially unravel Dodd-Frank, but the claim does not explicitly mention this consequence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that the proposed fast-track legislation would allow presidents to easily override domestic financial rules. It does not provide sufficient support for this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a future trade deal could be used by a president to override domestic financial rules. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the limitations and checks on presidential power in relation to trade agreements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives on the impact of the proposed fast-track legislation. It presents a one-sided view that suggests the legislation would allow presidents to easily override domestic financial rules without exploring other possible outcomes or interpretations."}
