{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the negative impact on job creation under Scott Walker's governorship, stating that it has gotten worse each year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that job creation has worsened each year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between Scott Walker's governorship and job creation without considering other factors that may influence job growth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that job creation increased in 2012 compared to 2011, indicating a fluctuation rather than a consistent decline.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual job creation numbers by focusing on specific years without providing a comprehensive overview of the entire governorship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for fluctuations in job creation, such as national economic trends or industry-specific factors."}
