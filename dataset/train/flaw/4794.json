{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's support for Planned Parenthood by simply stating that they both say it is \"terrific\" and should keep taxpayer funding. The expert's verdict provides additional information about Clinton's strong support for Planned Parenthood, including her statement that she would like to see the organization receive more funding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have explicitly stated that Planned Parenthood is \"terrific\" and should keep taxpayer funding. The expert's verdict provides statements from both candidates about their positions on Planned Parenthood, but it does not include direct quotes supporting the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton hold the same position on Planned Parenthood and taxpayer funding based on their past statements. However, the expert's verdict highlights the fact that Trump's stance on abortion and Planned Parenthood has changed over time, making it problematic to assume that he currently holds the same position as Clinton.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the candidates' statements about Planned Parenthood. The expert's verdict provides additional context, such as Trump's changing positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood, which suggests that there may be alternative explanations for their statements beyond simply supporting the organization."}
