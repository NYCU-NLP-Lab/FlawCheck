{"Understate": "The claim understates the actual policy implemented by the CBN. While the claim states that Nigeria has banned textile imports, the expert's verdict clarifies that the CBN has added textiles to a list of items that are not eligible for foreign exchange. This implies that importers would have to resort to the black market to purchase foreign currencies at higher prices.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article provided in support of the claim is only four lines long and does not provide any evidence or further information to back up the claim of a complete ban on textile imports.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the addition of textiles to the list of items not eligible for foreign exchange equates to a complete ban on textile imports. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that importers can still import these items using their own funds without relying on the Nigerian foreign exchange markets.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the policy of adding items to the list of non-eligible items for foreign exchange is aimed at conserving foreign exchange and boosting local production, rather than completely banning imports."}
