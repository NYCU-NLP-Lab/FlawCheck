{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the right to vote has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship, as it is presented as a definitive statement without acknowledging any historical limitations or restrictions on voting rights.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the right to vote has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship. The evidence provided includes opinions and historical research, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of voting rights throughout American history.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that extending voting rights to non-citizens is a valid and fair proposition without adequately addressing the potential consequences or implications of such a policy change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why non-citizens may have been allowed to vote in certain historical contexts, such as the exclusion of certain citizen groups from voting rights during those periods."}
