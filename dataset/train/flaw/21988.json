{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerated because it states that the last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014, implying that there are no longer any high schools where white students make up a majority of graduates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed up by specific data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the changing demographics and the graduation of the last majority-Anglo high school class in 2014 signify the end of dominance for Anglo residents in Texas, which could be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations, such as the presence of suburban or rural schools where white students still make up a majority of graduates."}
