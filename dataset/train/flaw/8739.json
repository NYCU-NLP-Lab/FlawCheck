{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential conflict of interest that Rex Tillerson's holdings in ExxonMobil could pose if he is confirmed as Secretary of State. The expert's verdict mentions that his shares in the company could create a potential conflict of interest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to verify whether Rex Tillerson is required to divest his holdings as a requirement to serve as Secretary of State. The expert's verdict mentions that federal law prohibits financial conflicts of interest, but it does not explicitly state whether divestment is a requirement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations or options for handling the potential conflict of interest. The expert's verdict provides alternative options for Tillerson to legally hold onto his stock while serving as Secretary of State, such as recusing himself from matters that affect Exxon or placing his assets in a blind trust.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that divesting holdings is a requirement for Tillerson to serve as Secretary of State. However, the expert's verdict mentions that divestment may not be necessary if other measures, such as recusal or placing assets in a blind trust, are taken.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or make exaggerated claims.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any specific point or provide inconsistent information."}
