{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Kenya has achieved a transition rate of 100% from primary to secondary school contradicts the fact that not all students progress from primary to secondary education.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the achievement of a 100% transition rate, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it repeats previously unproven claims without providing evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a 100% transition rate is achievable and does not take into account other factors such as teacher shortages that may affect learning outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the distribution of textbooks and the impact it has on learning outcomes."}
