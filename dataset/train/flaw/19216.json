{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that 80% of the world's population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or completely outlawed. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim relies on the broadest definition of threats to religion, which suggests that the actual percentage may be lower.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the underlying analysis included the United States in the same category as countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, which raises questions about the methodology and accuracy of the claim. This lack of support undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights that additional nuance is required when interpreting the findings of the claim. This suggests that the claim may falter or oversimplify the complex nature of religious liberty and its restrictions worldwide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that religious liberty is in significant danger or completely outlawed in the countries where 80% of the world's population lives. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the restrictions may not evenly affect all the people in these countries, indicating a problematic assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Pew Research Center's survey of religious restrictions looked at government actions and actions by individuals or groups. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the restrictions on religious liberty, such as social hostility, which are not explicitly addressed in the claim."}
