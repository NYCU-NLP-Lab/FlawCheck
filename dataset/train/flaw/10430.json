{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the support for oppressive Sharia law by stating that 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support it, without considering the nuances and variations in individuals' beliefs and interpretations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia law. The Pew Research study mentioned provides information about the support for Sharia law among Afghan Muslims, but it does not specify the percentage of the entire population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for Sharia law automatically translates into support for oppressive practices, without considering the variations and personal interpretations within the Afghan Muslim population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the support of Sharia law in Afghanistan, such as cultural, religious, or historical factors, which are not addressed in the claim."}
