{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the violence by stating that the young woman was \"beaten up\" by anti-Trump demonstrators, when in reality the image is from a Mexican drama series and not related to the San Jose rally.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the young woman in the image was actually a victim of anti-Trump demonstrators at the rally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of comments from San Jose Mayor, Obama, Hillary, and Bernie on the image is evidence of their support for the violence, without considering alternative reasons for their silence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it is a screenshot from a Mexican drama series, rather than a real incident at the rally."}
