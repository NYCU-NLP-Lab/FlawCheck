{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it states that Donald Trump specifically removed the terms \"LGBT\" and \"climate change\" from the White House website, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that the majority of content was transferred to ObamaWhiteHouse.gov and the terms were not specifically removed by Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the terms \"LGBT\" and \"climate change\" on the White House website immediately after Inauguration Day is a deliberate action by Donald Trump. However, the expert's verdict explains that the absence was due to the digital transition process and the migration of content to a new website.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the absence of the terms \"LGBT\" and \"climate change\" on the White House website, stating that the content related to the Obama administration was migrated to ObamaWhiteHouse.gov, where the terms are still readily available.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the terms \"LGBT\" and \"climate change\" are still accessible on ObamaWhiteHouse.gov, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the digital transition process and the migration of content from WhiteHouse.gov to ObamaWhiteHouse.gov, as explained in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a complete understanding of the digital transition process and the reasons for the absence of the terms \"LGBT\" and \"climate change\" on the White House website, as explained in the expert's verdict."}
