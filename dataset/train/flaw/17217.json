{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that State Rep. Kathleen Peters has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions automatically makes someone pro-abortion, without considering other factors or nuances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Peters' voting record or her stance on abortion, such as her belief in limited government intervention or her specific views on government-funded abortions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate or oversimplify Peters' stance on abortion by labeling her as \"pro-abortion\" based solely on her voting record, without considering her statements clarifying her position as \"absolutely pro-life\" and her belief in protecting unborn children.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Peters has stated she does not support government-funded abortions, but this is not acknowledged in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent understanding of Peters' stance on abortion, as she initially gave vague responses and later clarified her position.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Peters' pro-abortion stance by stating she has a \"100 percent pro-abortion voting record\" without considering other votes or actions she may have taken in support of pro-life policies."}
