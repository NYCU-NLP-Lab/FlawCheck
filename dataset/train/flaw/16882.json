{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which President Obama and his administration avoid using the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that the White House does indeed try to avoid invoking Islam while describing the Islamic State and its followers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that \"nobody in the administration will say the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019\" The expert's verdict mentions that the White House press office did not respond to inquiries, and the search conducted could not scour all 1,900 items that came up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the use of the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" is necessary in order to effectively fight against ISIS or define the enemy. The expert's verdict includes a statement by Senator Ted Cruz that the U.S. can't defeat an enemy it won't define, implying that the assumption is being made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may ignore the alternative explanation that the White House wants to avoid tying the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to terrorism and prefers to describe the organization's philosophy in non-religious terms such as \"violent extremism.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the White House aims to avoid this association, as reported by PolitiFact National, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times."}
