{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Dean Heller helped craft a repeal bill that would have slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The bill in question never came up for a vote, and Heller's team argues that it left the current law on pre-existing conditions untouched.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Graham-Cassidy bill would have definitively \"slashed\" protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, without considering the ambiguity created by the bill's rules for state waivers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Dean Heller \"helped craft a partisan repeal bill.\" While he was an original co-sponsor of the Graham-Cassidy bill, it never came up for a vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as Heller's team argues that the bill left pre-existing condition protections untouched and that the word \"shall\" in the bill created an imperative to retain access to coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."}
