{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Hillary Clinton's filibuster on the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The expert mentions that there is a gray area regarding whether a filibuster actually occurred and it is difficult to attribute responsibility solely to Clinton.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton filibustered legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The expert mentions that there is no record of a cloture vote, which is a clear indication of a filibuster.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if a filibuster did occur, Hillary Clinton was solely responsible for it. However, the expert points out that Senate Democrats, including Clinton, may have opposed the bill as a bloc, and Republican leadership chose not to introduce it on the floor of the full Senate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for why the bill was not brought before the full Senate, which is the suspicion that Senate Democrats would oppose it. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Clinton's filibuster was the reason for the bill not being passed."}
