{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the Milwaukee County bus system has \"among the highest fares in the nation.\" The expert's analysis shows that while some cities have higher base fares, there are also several systems with higher fares for longer routes or additional charges for transfers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that the Milwaukee County bus system has \"among the highest fares in the nation.\" The expert's analysis shows a comparison of fares in 11 cities, but it is unclear how representative this sample is of all bus systems in the nation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the fares in the Milwaukee County bus system. For example, the increased route miles may have been the result of a settlement related to a lawsuit, rather than solely due to Abele's leadership.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of bus fares across the nation. The expert's analysis highlights the limitations of comparing fares in different cities and the lack of a single comprehensive resource for such information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by suggesting that high fares are solely indicative of a poorly managed bus system. The expert's analysis does not provide evidence to support or refute this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fares in the Milwaukee County bus system by not considering the higher fares for longer trips or additional charges for transfers. The expert's analysis shows that there are several transit systems with higher base fares or additional charges.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided by the expert's analysis. The fares in the Milwaukee County bus system have remained at $2.25, as stated in the claim."}
