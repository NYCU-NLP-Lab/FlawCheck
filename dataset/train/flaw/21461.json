{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the daily expense payments received by Wisconsin politicians by stating that they receive payments \"even if they don't spend a dime on meals, lodging, or travel.\" This may be an exaggeration as there may be limitations or conditions attached to the payments.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to validate the assertion that no receipts are required for politicians to receive their daily expense payments. More information or evidence is needed to confirm this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the per diem payments are solely based on the honor system and that politicians can collect them without spending any money on meals, lodging, or travel. This assumption may oversimplify the actual process and requirements for receiving the payments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations or justifications for the daily expense payments received by Wisconsin politicians, such as the need to cover legitimate expenses incurred during legislative business. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
