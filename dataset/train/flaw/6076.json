{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that the dead bodies of policemen killed in the Maharashtra Maoist attack were shrouded in cardboard boxes. The expert's verdict mentions that the photographs circulating on social media are actually from a different incident in 2017, involving military personnel killed in a helicopter crash in Tawang.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bodies of the slain security personnel in the Maharashtra Naxal attack received state honors during their last rites, as reported by the media. The expert's verdict includes a tweet from ANI showing the wreath-laying ceremony of the security personnel, which clearly shows that their bodies were not wrapped in cardboard boxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs of dead bodies wrapped in cardboard boxes are related to the recent Maoist attack in Maharashtra. However, the expert's verdict reveals that these images are actually unrelated and from a different incident in 2017.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the images circulating on social media with the claim of being the dead bodies of policemen killed in the Maoist attack are actually from a previous incident involving military personnel. This alternative explanation challenges the initial claim's assertion.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that the dead bodies of the policemen were shrouded in cardboard boxes, which is not supported by any evidence. The expert's verdict provides evidence to the contrary, showing that the bodies received state honors during the last rites.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in its presentation. The expert's verdict, however, highlights the inconsistency between the claim and the actual facts."}
