{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the budget cuts on UW-Madison by stating that they have \"no more reserves to spend down.\" It is possible that there are still some reserves available, but they may not be sufficient to cover the budget cuts adequately.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that UW-Madison has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" It would require more information and financial documentation to verify this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that UW-Madison was explicitly told to spend down its reserves two years ago, but there is no explicit order mentioned in the expert's verdict. This assumption may be problematic as it is based on the interpretation of the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau report.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of reserves at UW-Madison. It is possible that there were other factors or financial decisions that led to the depletion of reserves, aside from the budget cuts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no explicit order for UW-Madison to trim its reserves. The expert's verdict states that the report disclosing the reserves led to a budget cut and pressure to reduce reserves, but there was no direct instruction given to UW-Madison.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the budget cuts by stating that UW-Madison has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" It is possible that there are still some reserves available, but they may not be sufficient to cover the budget cuts adequately."}
