{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no record of anyone attributing the quote to JFK until around 2012 or so, despite countless historians and academics studying Kennedy's words. This lack of historical evidence supports the bias of a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict questions the plausibility of such an aptly appealing, contemporary commentary being lost to the annals of history. This highlights a problematic assumption in the claim that such a quote would not have been discovered or attributed to JFK until many years after his death.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that a search of the public papers of John F. Kennedy only yields one hit for the phrase \"secret societies,\" which does not point to the quote in question. This contradicts the claim that JFK made a statement about secret societies.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict highlights that the quote being circulated on social media in 2016 was not new, as readers had asked about it as far back as 2012. This suggests that the claim may understate the timeline and extent of the quote's circulation.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the quote is attributed to JFK in an eerily predictive manner, suggesting that it exaggerates the prophetic nature of the quote and its relevance to contemporary issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict questions the likelihood of JFK making eerie \"one day when I'm gone\" prophecies, considering his sudden and unexpected death. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the quote's origin or attribution."}
