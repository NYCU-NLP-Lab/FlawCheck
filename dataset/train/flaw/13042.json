{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support the speaker has for DACA and Dreamers, as the expert's research shows that the speaker has voted both for and against legislation related to permanent legal residency for DACA recipients.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting DACA and Dreamers automatically means supporting legal residency or citizenship for them, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the speaker's consistent support for DACA and Dreamers, as the expert's research shows conflicting statements and actions from the speaker.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the speaker's statements and actions, such as political considerations or changes in stance over time."}
