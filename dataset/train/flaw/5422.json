{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that there are \"only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders.\" The article points out that there are additional individuals involved in tracking sex offenders, such as probation or parole agents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that there are \"nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for.\" The number seems to come from a Democratic lawmaker and may not be fully reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders is inadequate. However, the article mentions that the Department of Corrections has other mechanisms in place to monitor and track offenders, including probation and parole agents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of non-compliant sex offenders. The article suggests that some offenders may simply have provided incorrect information or failed to update their details, rather than actively evading authorities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the situation by presenting a potentially misleading picture of the number of sex offenders being tracked and accounted for."}
