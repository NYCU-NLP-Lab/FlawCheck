{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of small-business owners forced out of their homes, as only two of them actually lost their houses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the bank co-founded by Sen. Pat Toomey forced small-business owners out of their homes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loan tactic used by the bank is controversial and implies wrongdoing, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of homeowners affected by the loan tactic, as it only mentions two individuals losing their homes, while the original claim stated that 21 small-business owners were forced out of their homes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or perspectives on the use of the loan tactic, as it presents it as inherently negative without acknowledging arguments in favor of its use by lenders."}
