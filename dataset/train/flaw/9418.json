{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the VA accountability law by stating that \"before, there was nothing you could do\" to fire employees, when in fact there were existing procedures in place to remove VA employees.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of employees fired by the VA before Trump took office, as data shows that more than 2,000 employees were fired each year going back to 2006.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the VA accountability law allows the VA to say \"you're fired\" to employees. The expert's verdict provides data on increased terminations, but it does not explicitly state that the law allows for immediate termination.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in terminations, such as changes in management or other factors unrelated to the VA accountability law."}
