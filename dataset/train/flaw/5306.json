{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the risk of pre-term pregnancy for pregnant women who stand for five to six hours at a time by stating that it increases their risk by 80 percent. The expert's verdict states that the risk estimate in the 20-30 percent range is more reasonable.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the 80 percent statistic is not supported by evidence or specific studies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that standing for five to six hours at a time is the main factor contributing to an 80 percent increased risk of pre-term pregnancy. The expert's verdict mentions that other factors, such as job satisfaction and movement, can also affect the risk.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations for the risk of pre-term pregnancy, such as the satisfaction of the job and the availability of long prenatal leaves in countries with low infant mortality rates."}
