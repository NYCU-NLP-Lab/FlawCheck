{"Contradict fact": "The claim of Hillary Clinton refusing to exit her vehicle is contradicted by the evidence of a photograph showing her walking through a crowd and interacting with supporters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single Facebook post from an anonymous person, which is not sufficient evidence to support the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's decision not to exit her vehicle was solely due to the \"lock her up\" chants, without considering other possible reasons for her actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that Clinton made an impromptu stop to greet early voters and interact with supporters, as reported by the Sun-Sentinel. The \"lock her up\" chants did not prevent her from taking selfies with supporters.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Clinton \"almost melted at the sight of Trump signs surrounding her,\" which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its accuracy and consistency by presenting contradictory evidence and failing to acknowledge the full context of Clinton's visit."}
