{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Austin ISD has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas, without providing evidence or comparison to all major cities in the state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that graduation rates are the sole determinant of the quality of education in a city, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the higher graduation rates in Austin, such as different student demographics or educational policies."}
