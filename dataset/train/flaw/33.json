{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential for delegates to legally change the Republican National Convention rules to prevent Donald Trump's nomination. The expert's verdict mentions that the rules committee has the power to change the rules and the nomination is still up to the delegates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the statement that delegates cannot \"legally\" change the convention rules.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that delegates do have the authority to change the rules and prevent Trump's nomination, as mentioned by the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the rules committee and delegates have the power to change the rules, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that delegates cannot legally change the convention rules, without providing sufficient evidence or legal analysis to support this assumption."}
