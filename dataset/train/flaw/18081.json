{"Understate": "The claim may understate the problem by stating that \"more than half\" of criminal trials are rescheduled or called off, while the expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual proportion is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or statistics to support the statement that \"more than half\" of criminal trials are affected, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that rescheduling or calling off trials is a significant issue without providing context or comparison to other countries' legal systems.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that some trials may be rescheduled or called off due to factors outside of systemic errors, such as defendants not showing up or administrative problems. This alternative explanation is not addressed in the claim."}
