{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that the portrait of Prosenjit Chatterjee was revealed at Rashtrapati Bhavan instead of Subhas Chandra Bose. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the portrait unveiled was indeed of Subhas Chandra Bose.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet by Dr Adil Hossain, whose tweets are now protected. The expert's verdict provides evidence from various sources, including politicians, journalists, and a BJP leader, to counter the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the portrait unveiled is of Prosenjit Chatterjee based on a tweet, without providing substantial evidence. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the portrait is of Subhas Chandra Bose.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the portrait of Prosenjit Chatterjee was not unveiled at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the portrait is of Subhas Chandra Bose, based on a comparison with a photograph of Bose tweeted by a BJP leader."}
