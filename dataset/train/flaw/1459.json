{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video does not show a drunk police officer on the streets after India relaxed rules on liquor sales during the COVID-19 lockdown. The video actually shows an intoxicated police officer in Faizabad in June 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading video and does not provide accurate information about the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is related to the relaxation of liquor sales rules during the COVID-19 lockdown in India, which is not true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video is from a different time and location (Faizabad in June 2017) and is not related to the COVID-19 lockdown or the relaxation of liquor sales rules."}
