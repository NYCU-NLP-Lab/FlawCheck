{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence of a \"Capitol Invasion\" Lego set that was released months ahead of the riots. In reality, the Lego set does not exist and was a fabricated image created as a joke.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the existence of the Lego set. It is based on a fabricated image shared on social media platforms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the release of a Lego set depicting the Capitol invasion implies a deeper plot or coordination behind the riots. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the origin of the fabricated Lego set image, such as it being created as a joke by an artist.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Lego set does not exist and was never released to the public. This is confirmed by the LEGO Press Office's statement that the image has nothing to do with the LEGO Group.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the fabricated Lego set image as evidence of a deeper plot or coordination behind the Capitol invasion, without considering the lack of authenticity and the artist's confirmation that it was created in jest.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias in the provided claim."}
