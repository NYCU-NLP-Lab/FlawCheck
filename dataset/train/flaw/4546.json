{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Cruz and Rubio have missed their votes by stating that they have missed the \"vast majority\" of their votes, which is not supported by the data provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that Cruz and Rubio have missed the majority of their votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that missing a significant number of votes is inherently negative or problematic without considering other factors that may contribute to missed votes, such as conflicting responsibilities or scheduling conflicts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why Cruz and Rubio have missed votes, such as conflicting campaign schedules or other responsibilities, which are not explored or considered in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear timeframe for the missed votes, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement."}
