{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which three companies received 90% of the tax credits. The expert's verdict provides information that CVS received 59% of the tax credits, which is less than the claimed 90%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that two companies not located in Rhode Island received a significant portion of the tax credits. The expert's verdict also does not provide any additional evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tax credits should be evenly distributed among companies, and the concentration of tax credits among a few companies is seen as favoritism. This assumption may be problematic as tax credits are often designed to incentivize specific industries or activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why certain companies received a majority of the tax credits. The expert's verdict mentions that CVS received tax credits through specific programs that incentivize job creation and construction projects."}
