{"Contradict fact": "The claim made by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that there hasn't been a single fatality under 25 due to COVID-19 contradicts the data compiled by the CDC, multiple states, and news organizations that show deaths among young people in the United States.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of deaths among young people caused by COVID-19. While Florida may not have reported any deaths under the age of 25, there have been several deaths in that age group across the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed by the data compiled by the CDC, multiple states, and news organizations that show deaths among young people due to COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that while death remains rare for young, otherwise healthy people, there have been cases of fatalities among young individuals due to COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that COVID-19 does not pose a threat to individuals under 25, despite evidence showing deaths in that age group.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the absence of fatalities under 25 due to COVID-19 by stating that \"nationwide, there\u2019s been a single fatality under 25,\" when there have been multiple deaths in that age group.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the data and evidence that contradicts the statement made by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis."}
