{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the Democratic Party created a debate schedule \"to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates\" can be seen as an exaggeration, as the fact-check shows that the Democratic debate schedule did not provide the same level of exposure as the Republican debate schedule.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations of the debate schedule in terms of providing sufficient exposure for voters, as some Democrats and critics argue that the schedule limited voters' exposure and gave an advantage to Hillary Clinton.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of evidence or data to prove that the debate schedule truly maximized the opportunity for voters to see the Democratic candidates. The fact-check provides viewership numbers that indicate a lower cumulative viewership for Democratic debates compared to Republican debates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the debate schedule was designed solely to maximize voter exposure to the Democratic candidates, without considering other potential factors or motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The fact-check presents an alternative explanation by highlighting the differences in the number of debates and viewership between the Democratic and Republican parties, suggesting that the Democratic schedule did not provide the same level of opportunity for voters to see their candidates as the Republican schedule did."}
