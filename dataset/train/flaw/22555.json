{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that nearly 90% of Travis County government races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary. The expert's verdict mentions that there are only three county government offices with the potential of being settled in the November election, but it does not provide further data or analysis to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert assumes that no Libertarian or Green Party candidates will win, based on the absence of such candidates on the secretary of state's website. This assumption may overlook the possibility of third-party candidates winning in the elections.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of county government races that will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary. The expert's verdict states that \"nearly 90% of all county races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary,\" suggesting that the actual percentage may be higher than 90%.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Travis County is predominantly Democratic, as mentioned by the expert. The claim implies that the November elections in Travis County may not have a significant impact, while the expert's verdict highlights the county's blue political leanings.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the Democratic primary in determining the outcome of Travis County government races. The expert's verdict suggests that the majority of county races will be settled by the primary, but it does not provide specific data or analysis to support this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not mention any alternative explanations for the claim."}
