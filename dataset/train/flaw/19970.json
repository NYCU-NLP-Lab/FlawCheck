{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that the immigration visa lottery \"randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people.\" This is an exaggeration because the lottery program does have certain requirements and vetting processes in place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the visa lottery program does not consider skill, merit, or safety.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the visa lottery program is solely based on random selection without any consideration for skill, merit, or safety. This assumption overlooks the vetting process and criteria that applicants must meet.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim as it fails to mention the education and work experience requirements that applicants must meet, as well as the vetting process they undergo before being awarded the diversity visa.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the visa lottery program does consider education, work experience, and vetting processes in the selection of applicants."}
