{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential tax increase under Joe Biden's tax plan by stating that the tax rate on a family making $75,000 would go from 12% to 25%. The expert's verdict clarifies that Biden's proposal does not call for a tax increase on those making less than $400,000.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential impact of Biden's tax plan by only focusing on the 12% tax rate and not considering other aspects of the plan that could indirectly affect middle-income earners.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the tax rate for a family making $75,000 would increase to 25% under Joe Biden.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Joe Biden's tax plan would directly lead to a 25% tax rate for a family making $75,000. The expert's verdict clarifies that this is not the case and that the claim is false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the claim by stating that while Biden's plan does not call for a direct tax increase on those earning less than $400,000, an increased corporate tax rate could result in a small tax increase for middle-income earners."}
