{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the improvement in Wisconsin's business ranking from the bottom 10 to the top 10. While Chief Executive Magazine ranked Wisconsin 10th in its 2017 survey, other prominent sources like CNBC, Tax Foundation, Site Selection Magazine, and Forbes have ranked Wisconsin lower in terms of business climate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only references one ranking from Chief Executive Magazine. Other rankings from various sources contradict the claim and show Wisconsin's business climate to be lower than the top 10.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being ranked in the top 10 by Chief Executive Magazine is the definitive measure of a state's business climate. However, other surveys and rankings show different results, indicating that there may be alternative measures and perspectives on what constitutes a favorable business climate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the improvement in Wisconsin's business ranking. It attributes the improvement solely to the reforms implemented under Governor Scott Walker's watch, but other factors, such as economic trends or external investments like the Foxconn plant, could also have influenced the ranking.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and consistent source for the ranking it refers to. While a spokesperson for Governor Walker mentioned Chief Executive Magazine's ranking, the claim itself does not explicitly cite the source, which can create confusion or ambiguity.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the negative rankings and assessments of Wisconsin's business climate by only focusing on one favorable ranking. By not acknowledging the lower rankings from other reputable sources, the claim downplays the overall assessment of Wisconsin's business climate."}
