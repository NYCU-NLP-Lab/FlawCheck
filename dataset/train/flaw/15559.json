{"Understate": "The claim may understate the level of opposition to major changes in Medicare and support for higher taxes on the wealthy by using the phrase \"large majorities\" without providing specific percentages or numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that \"large majorities\" of the public oppose major changes to Medicare and favor higher taxes on the wealthy. It only references polls mentioned by Paul Krugman without providing the full details or methodology of those polls.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the polls mentioned by Paul Krugman accurately represent the views of the entire public. However, it does not provide information on the sample size, demographics, or methodology of those polls, which could potentially introduce biases or limitations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the poll results, such as potential biases in the wording of the poll questions or the influence of partisan affiliations on respondents' answers. It presents the poll results as a direct reflection of public opinion without exploring other factors that could impact the results."}
