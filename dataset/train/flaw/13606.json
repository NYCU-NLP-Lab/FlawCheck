{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that a federal judge ordered Wisconsin to have all ballots counted by 8 p.m. on the day of the election, which is not true.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that voters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote, so it is impossible for all votes to be counted by 8 p.m.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or name of the judge who allegedly made the ruling.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all ballots can be counted by 8 p.m., which is not feasible considering the time it takes to process and count the ballots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the actual ruling from a federal judge, which allows absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted if postmarked by Election Day."}
