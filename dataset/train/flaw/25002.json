{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict mentions that Donald Trump twisted the excerpts from Hillary Clinton's speeches in some cases, indicating an exaggeration of the claims made by Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the full speeches given by Clinton are not available, and the Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the leaked emails. This lack of supporting evidence suggests a bias towards insufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict points out that Trump distorted a quote from Clinton regarding refugees and ISIS infiltrations. This suggests a bias towards making problematic assumptions based on the quote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the passage cited by Trump regarding Benghazi was not written by Sidney Blumenthal, but by a Newsweek reporter. This indicates an alternative explanation to Trump's claim."}
