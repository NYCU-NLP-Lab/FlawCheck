{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of naval exercises between Russia and China. The evidence provided mentions joint naval exercises in the East China Sea and the Black Sea, but does not specify the frequency or scale of these exercises.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it lacks specific details about the location and nature of the naval exercises. The expert's verdict mentions exercises in the East China Sea and the Black Sea, but does not provide further information or evidence to support the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to fully substantiate the assertion that Russia and China are \"doing naval exercises together.\" While some evidence of joint naval exercises is mentioned, it does not provide a comprehensive picture of the extent or frequency of these exercises.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the naval exercises between Russia and China are a result of Obama's actions, specifically stating that he \"forced them together.\" However, the evidence provided does not explicitly support this assumption or provide a direct link between Obama's actions and the joint exercises.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the joint naval exercises between Russia and China. The evidence suggests that the exercises may be a result of Russia's need to strengthen its relationship with China due to sanctions and to demonstrate alternative options to the United States and the EU."}
