{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Zika \"will be everywhere in the United States\" is an exaggeration, as it is unlikely to be present in all areas of the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to suggest that Zika will be widespread throughout the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Zika will spread extensively in the United States without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the spread of Zika, such as travel-related cases or localized outbreaks, which contradict the claim that it will be everywhere in the United States."}
