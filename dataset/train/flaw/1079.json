{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the tax burden of Ohio by stating that it is the seventh highest taxed state in America without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative rankings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough current and reliable support to back up the assertion that Ohio is the seventh highest taxed state. The data from the Tax Foundation, which was used to support the claim, is outdated and no longer the most current.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the seventh highest taxed state is inherently negative and implies that lower taxes are necessary for competitiveness, without considering other factors that contribute to a state's competitiveness.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Ohio's tax burden ranking, such as changes in tax policies or economic factors that may have influenced the ranking over time.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and up-to-date information regarding Ohio's tax burden ranking. The discrepancy between the rankings in the Jan. 2010 report and the Feb. 23, 2011 report suggests inconsistencies in the claim's supporting evidence."}
