{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the high cost of child care as the \"No. 1 reason\" for having fewer children than desired.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a single survey as evidence, which may not be sufficient to establish the high cost of child care as the primary reason for having fewer children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high cost of child care is the main factor influencing people's decision to have fewer children, without considering other factors that may also play a significant role.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that other factors, such as wanting more time with existing children, are also common reasons for having fewer children. This suggests that the high cost of child care may not be the sole or primary reason for this decision."}
