{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"somebody in the Obama regime decided to get rid of\" the citizenship question in the census. The expert's verdict clarifies that the citizenship question did not disappear entirely under former President Barack Obama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific information about who in the Obama administration made the decision to remove the citizenship question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of the citizenship question was solely the decision of someone in the Obama administration, without considering other factors or potential reasons for its removal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that the citizenship question was not eliminated by the Obama administration, but rather, it was still asked through the American Community Survey.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not accurately representing the history of the census citizenship question, as explained by the expert's verdict. It suggests that the question was eliminated by the Obama administration, which is not entirely true."}
