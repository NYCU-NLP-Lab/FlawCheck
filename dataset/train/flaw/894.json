{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of school electrification by stating that 99% of all schools have been connected to electricity. This is because the expert's verdict mentions that only 4.5 million households were connected to electricity after 78 years of colonial rule and 50 years of independence administrations, suggesting that achieving 99% school electrification in a shorter period of time may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the assertion that 99% of all schools have been connected to electricity. Without sufficient supporting information, the claim lacks enough support to be considered reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that connecting schools to electricity is a sufficient indicator of progress or development in the education sector. However, the claim does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this assumption, making it problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the number of schools connected to electricity. It attributes the increase solely to the efforts of the current administration, but there may be other factors or initiatives that have contributed to the increase.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that only 4.5 million households were connected to electricity after several decades. This suggests that the claim's assertion of connecting 99% of all schools to electricity may contradict the available evidence.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as there is no specific evidence or information provided to assess its consistency or reliability.", "Understate": "There is no indication in the claim or the expert's verdict that the extent of school electrification is understated."}
