{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the 2020 election by suggesting that it was not unusually close, despite evidence that it was a decisive victory for Joe Biden.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that the election was not unusually close.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison to previous elections and the electoral vote margin is sufficient to determine whether the 2020 election was unusually close, without considering other factors such as voter turnout or the impact of external events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why the 2020 election was not unusually close, such as changes in the political landscape or the impact of campaign strategies, that are not addressed in the claim."}
