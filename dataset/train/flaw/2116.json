{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the debt on the entire economy by using the term \"eclipse\" which implies a complete takeover or overshadowing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the debt will soon eclipse the entire economy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the debt will grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead without providing any concrete evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent definition of the debt, as it mentions both the total debt and the public debt, which can lead to confusion and inconsistency in the argument.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges an alternative measure of debt known as \"public debt\" which presents a different perspective and smaller debt-to-GDP comparisons. This suggests that there are alternative explanations or interpretations of the debt situation."}
