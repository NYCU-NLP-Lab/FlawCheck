{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement that \"97% of sanitary towels in South Korea contain chemicals that cause cancer,\" as the actual investigation found that none of the products contained sufficient levels of harmful chemicals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Korean-language post without providing any scientific evidence or referencing the official investigation conducted by the ministry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of any traces of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in sanitary towels automatically leads to an increased risk of cancer, which is a problematic assumption as the investigation concluded that the levels detected were not sufficient to cause harm.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that the lax regulations on sanitary towels in South Korea, as criticized by the politician, may have led to the presence of VOCs in some products, but not at levels that pose a significant health risk."}
