{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which New York has \"among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation.\" While the claim is supported by some data, it is important to consider more recent data and other factors that may affect the ranking of tax burdens among states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on data from 2012, which may not accurately reflect the current tax burden in New York. More recent data is needed to provide stronger support for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for New York's high tax burden, such as the state's relatively high income levels. The spokesperson for the Tax Foundation acknowledges that New York's high tax burden is partly driven by being a high-income state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that New York's high tax burden is solely the result of Governor Cuomo's actions or lack thereof. It does not consider other factors, such as legislative decisions or economic factors, that may contribute to the tax burden.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on data from 2012 and not considering more recent data or alternative explanations. This weakens the overall argument and makes it less reliable.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating the tax burden in New York."}
