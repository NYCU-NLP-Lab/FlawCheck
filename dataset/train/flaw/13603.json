{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Lt. Gov. Kleefisch made a successful \"cold call\" and persuaded an Illinois company to relocate to Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the relocation of the company was solely due to Lt. Gov. Kleefisch's cold call, without considering other factors that may have influenced the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the company's relocation, such as the potential impact of the Illinois legislature passing a bill that would tax online retailers."}
