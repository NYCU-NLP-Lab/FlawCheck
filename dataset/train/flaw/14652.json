{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the availability of learnership programmes by stating that the South African police is advertising a programme for 2021, when in fact, the police confirmed that there are no learnership programmes at the moment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides a Facebook post and an application form, but there is no information about how to apply for the alleged positions. Additionally, the misleading Facebook page does not include any authentic links or descriptions related to the police.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the advertised learnership programme is genuine based on the comments of social media users who believe it is real. However, the post has been confirmed to be fake by the SAPS, and there are other clues indicating that the Facebook page is not authentic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the SAPS confirmed that there are no learnership programmes at the moment. The misleading Facebook post falsely advertises such a programme.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the misleading Facebook post could be that it was created to deceive job seekers and collect their personal information or scam them in some way."}
