{"Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility that the White House cancelled the 2017 Easter Egg roll, as there are multiple factors that led people to believe it was cancelled, such as reports of the White House being unprepared for the event and the president's plans to be in Florida during Easter weekend.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as there is no official announcement about the cancellation of the Easter Egg Roll and the event is still listed on the White House website.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the cancellation of a local Easter Egg hunt in Pennsylvania is related to the potential cancellation of the White House Easter Egg Roll.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations, such as the possibility that the event was not cancelled but faced challenges in organization and preparation."}
