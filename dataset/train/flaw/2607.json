{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the response of the crowd by suggesting that they all responded with the slogan \"Chowkidar Chor Hai\" when Rajnath Singh asked them to raise a slogan. It is unclear how many people actually responded with this particular slogan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove that Rajnath Singh actually asked the crowd to raise the slogan \"Chowkidar Chor Hai.\" The provided evidence includes a video clip that has been mischievously edited, and it is not clear if the crowd's response was in direct relation to Singh's request.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crowd's response of \"Chowkidar Chor Hai\" was a direct result of Rajnath Singh's request, without considering alternative explanations or influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by the expert's verdict, which states that the video clip was mischievously edited to suggest that the crowd responded with the slogan. This suggests that the response may not have been directly prompted by Singh's request.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video clip was edited and misrepresents the actual sequence of events. The crowd's response of \"Chowkidar Pure Hai\" was mischievously clipped from the video, creating a false narrative.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting a misleading narrative based on edited video footage."}
