{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of the scheme by stating that if every Indian citizen donates one rupee, it would generate a significant amount of money, surpassing Pakistan's defense expenditure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or official sources to support the existence of the scheme or the opening of a bank account for donations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the scheme was initiated by the Modi government based on suggestions from the public and Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and challenges associated with battle casualties and weapon purchases, as it presents the scheme as a simple solution without addressing potential issues or limitations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the existence of the fund, such as the announcement made by Indian Army veterans in 2016, which suggests that the scheme may have been in place before the Pulwama terror attack."}
