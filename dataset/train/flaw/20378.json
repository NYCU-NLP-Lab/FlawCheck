{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of remittances contributed, as it states \"upwards of maybe KSh290 billion\" without providing concrete evidence or data to support this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the statement about remittances contributing a significant amount to foreign exchange.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that remittances are the largest contributor to foreign exchange without providing any evidence or comparison to other sources of foreign exchange.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the contribution to foreign exchange, such as exports or foreign direct investment, which are not addressed in the claim."}
