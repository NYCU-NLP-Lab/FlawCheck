{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the defense agreement signed with Dassault Aviation in 2012 by implying that it directly relates to the current Rafale agreement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or details to support the assertion that reliance was already part of the defense agreement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the defense agreement signed in 2012 automatically translates to Reliance's involvement in the current Rafale agreement, without considering other factors or developments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Reliance's involvement in the Rafale agreement, such as political influence or favoritism.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by former President of France Francois Hollande, who stated that the Indian government proposed Anil Ambani's firm as the partner for the offset-clause under the current Rafale agreement, and the French government had no say in the matter."}
