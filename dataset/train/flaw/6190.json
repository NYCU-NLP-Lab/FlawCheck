{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that the average family in America pays more to their local hospital than to the IRS, without providing specific data or evidence to support this comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support in terms of specific data or statistics to back up the assertion that the average family pays more to their local hospital than to the IRS.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average family's payments to their local hospital and the IRS can be directly compared, without considering the different nature and purposes of these payments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as variations in individual circumstances, healthcare needs, and tax obligations, which could affect the comparison between payments to hospitals and the IRS.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average tax rate for the same family, as per the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was lowered to 13.5% in 2019, which is lower than the claim's assertion that families pay more to hospitals than to the IRS.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and nuances of healthcare costs and the overall tax burden faced by families, as it simplifies the comparison to a single statement without considering various factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a comprehensive analysis of healthcare costs and tax payments, as it relies on a single opinion piece and lacks a broader examination of the issue."}
