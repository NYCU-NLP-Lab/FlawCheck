{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decline in Georgia's public health by stating that it has declined without providing specific data or evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a quote from Governor Nathan Deal and an essay from a trade newspaper, which the expert finds to be slightly off target and not reflective of the broader picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the passage of House Bill 214, which creates a new Georgia Department of Public Health, is directly linked to the decline in Georgia's public health. However, this assumption may not be fully supported or proven.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert highlights that factors such as high school graduation rates, poverty, and crime rates can also impact the overall health of a population. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decline in Georgia's public health that are not addressed in the claim."}
