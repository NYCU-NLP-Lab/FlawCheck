{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of felons who have had their rights restored under the new clemency board.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that only four felons have had their rights restored under the current clemency board.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that other felons had their rights restored through pardons, which the claim does not mention.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the clemency board's performance in restoring civil rights, potentially leading to a biased representation of the situation."}
