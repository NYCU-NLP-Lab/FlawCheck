However, the expert points out that there is no evidence to support this assumption and that the rumor may be unfounded.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the rumor of Monroe's high IQ may have originated from a BuzzFeed list in 2013, but there is no citation or evidence to verify this claim. Therefore, there could be alternative explanations for the origin of the rumor.", "Contradict fact": "The expert contradicts the claim by stating that there is no reason to believe Monroe underwent IQ testing during a time when such tests were uncommon, especially considering her tumultuous upbringing and early marriage.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the lack of evidence and support for Monroe's high IQ measurement. The expert emphasizes that there is no information or details confirming that Monroe was actually tested for her intelligence quotient.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Monroe's intelligence by attributing a specific numerical value (168) to her IQ without any substantiating evidence. The lack of supporting information suggests that the claim could be an exaggeration or fabrication."}
