{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"200 consumer laws were destroyed\" may be an exaggeration, as the expert points out that the attorney who made the claim later backed off and said he did not mean it in a literal sense.", "Lack enough support": "The expert questions the lack of evidence or support provided to prove that 200 consumer laws were actually destroyed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the measure signed by Gov. Scott Walker in 2011 destroyed 200 consumer laws, without providing sufficient evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that the attorney who made the claim has changed his stance on the impact of the measure, initially stating that it would \"virtually repeal\" the statutes but later backing off from the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations for the impact of the measure, indicating that the claim may not provide a complete or accurate representation of the situation."}
