{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of the measure to repeal the prevailing wage law by stating that it would \"make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers\" through an \"illegal worker loophole in the state budget.\" The expert points out that the measure is a separate piece of legislation and not part of the state budget.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that repealing the prevailing wage law would lead to an increase in the hiring of illegal workers. The expert questions the connection between the measure and the hiring of illegal workers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prevailing wage law is the only factor preventing the hiring of illegal workers by state contractors. It fails to consider other potential factors or alternative explanations for the hiring practices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there may be alternative motivations for repealing the prevailing wage law, such as concerns about artificially inflated wages and increased project costs. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged or addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the measure to repeal the prevailing wage law is not part of the state budget. It falsely presents it as an \"illegal worker loophole in the state budget.\"", "Understate": "There is no clear instance of understatement in the claim or the expert's analysis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its argument by not providing enough evidence, making problematic assumptions, and contradicting facts. However, it is not consistently faltering throughout the entire claim."}
