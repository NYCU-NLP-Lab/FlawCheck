The evidence provided includes statements from different sources, making it difficult to determine the exact context and sequence of events leading to the delay in budget bills.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of the opposition to amendments banning Confederate battle flag sales on the delay in budget bills. Without concrete evidence and specific examples, it is difficult to determine the extent of the influence of this opposition.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the significance of the opposition to amendments banning Confederate battle flag sales in causing the delay of as many as six federal department budget bills.
