{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of the expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants under David Dewhurst's leadership. The expert's verdict suggests that the expansion was not as significant as portrayed in the claim.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the impact of David Dewhurst's leadership in passing proposals benefiting illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict acknowledges that Dewhurst has presided over Texas Senate approval of numerous changes in law, including proposals benefiting illegal immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that under David Dewhurst's leadership, the Texas Senate passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of evidence provided by the claim, suggesting that it is based on statements made by Dewhurst's Republican challenger.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that David Dewhurst's leadership was solely responsible for the passage of the expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict points out that the law allowing undocumented residents to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates was already in place before Dewhurst assumed his position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the passage of the expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions that the law was signed into law by Governor Rick Perry in 2005, suggesting that it was a collective decision rather than solely Dewhurst's leadership."}
