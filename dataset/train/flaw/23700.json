{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the success of job creation by stating a net increase of 45,000 jobs without providing further context or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the net increase in jobs is solely due to the efforts of Gov. John Kasich, without considering other contributing factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Ohio has created a net increase of 45,000 jobs since the beginning of the year."}
