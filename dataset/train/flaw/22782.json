{"Understate": "The claim understates the significant decrease in the number of people testing positive for influenza this season compared to the previous season.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up its assertion of a \"miracle\" decrease in flu cases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in flu cases is solely due to the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and precautions, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that other factors, such as high rates of flu vaccination, could also contribute to the decrease in flu cases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that flu cases are indeed down dramatically, as supported by data from the CDC and public health experts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the decrease in flu cases by using the term \"miracle\" and comparing it to a high number of cases from the previous year."}
