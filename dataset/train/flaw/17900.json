{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue by stating that Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation, when in fact they rank second in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of the median household income.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides data for one measurement (property taxes as a percentage of median household income) and does not consider other factors such as property taxes as a percentage of the median home value.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations as the ranking of property taxes may vary depending on the specific measurements used. In this case, Essex County ranks differently depending on whether median property taxes paid or taxes as a percentage of the median home value are considered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being ranked second in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of the median household income automatically translates to suffering the second highest property taxes in the nation. This assumption may not necessarily be accurate as other factors could impact the overall burden of property taxes.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the issue by not mentioning that Essex County ranks sixth in terms of median property tax bill and 92nd in terms of property taxes as a percentage of the median home value."}
