{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of deaths caused by cancer in Nigeria. The expert's verdict states that only 4% of deaths in Nigeria were caused by cancer in 2018, which contradicts the claim's assertion that 72,000 people die annually of cancer.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that 72,000 people die annually of cancer in Nigeria. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, mentions the World Health Organization's report on cancer deaths in Nigeria, indicating that there is more reliable information available.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all reported cancer cases in Nigeria result in death. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Nigeria's cancer cases account for about 15% of cases in West Africa, suggesting that not all reported cases lead to death.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative information about the percentage of deaths caused by cancer in Nigeria, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the claim's assertion of 72,000 annual cancer deaths."}
