{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount that Romney wants to add to the defense budget by stating it as $2 trillion, as it is based on estimates and projections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that the military has not asked for the additional defense budget.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the military's budgetary needs are accurately represented by their current budget and that they would not benefit from additional funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative reasons or justifications for Romney's plan to increase defense spending, such as national security concerns or geopolitical challenges."}
