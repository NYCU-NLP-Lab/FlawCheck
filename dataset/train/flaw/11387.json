{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the length of time since Hillary Clinton held a press conference by stating it has been 269 days (or 270 days on publication day) without providing any context or comparison to other candidates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or context to determine the significance of the length of time without a press conference.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that holding a press conference is the only way for a candidate to make themselves available to the press, disregarding other forms of media interaction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Clinton may not have held a press conference, such as scheduling conflicts or campaign strategy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the Clinton campaign's argument that Clinton has made herself available to the press in ways equivalent to press conferences, suggesting that she has not given a press conference."}
