{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that \"over 150,000 women lost the only health care they had,\" without providing specific evidence or context for this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal link between the Texas cutoff of aid to women's health care services and the increase in Medicaid birth rate and costs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Texas cutoff of aid to women's health care services, specifically Planned Parenthood clinics, was the sole cause of the increase in Medicaid birth rate and costs. It does not consider other potential factors that could have contributed to these outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or acknowledge alternative explanations for the increase in Medicaid birth rate and costs, such as changes in demographics or other healthcare policies."}
