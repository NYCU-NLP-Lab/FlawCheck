{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the presence of pro-Khalistan and pro-Pakistan videos linked to the farmers' protest, as the provided evidence only shows a few instances of such videos being shared.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the videos are linked to the farmers' protest. The evidence provided only shows that the videos were shared by individuals or news outlets, but it doesn't establish a direct connection to the protest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the videos are linked to the farmers' protest without providing concrete evidence or a clear explanation of how they are connected.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the sharing of these videos, such as individuals or groups trying to create controversy or spread misinformation, rather than a genuine connection to the farmers' protest.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the videos and their context. It focuses on specific instances of sharing without considering the broader picture or evaluating the credibility of the sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the videos are at least one-year-old, which suggests that they may not be directly related to the current farmers' protest."}
