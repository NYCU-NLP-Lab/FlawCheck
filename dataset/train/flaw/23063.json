{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that seven out of eight claims in the flyer are partially or completely true based on verifiable evidence. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient supporting evidence for one claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that attorneys representing Chauvin are likely to argue in the upcoming trial that he did not murder Floyd but rather operated within the law as an officer. This contradicts the claim made in the flyer, which may imply that the flyer is not entirely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA) is providing legal representation for Chauvin. This may imply an assumption that the MPPOA's involvement could potentially influence or bias Chauvin's defense.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict includes statements from Chauvin's former attorney and the MPD spokesperson, both of whom declined to comment or answer questions about Chauvin's career. This suggests the existence of alternative explanations or perspectives that are not fully explored or addressed in the claim.", "Understate": "It is difficult to determine if there is any specific understatement bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
