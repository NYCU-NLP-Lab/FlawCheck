{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that two mail-in ballots were sent to the same person with their names on both a week and a half apart. The evidence provided is a blurry image that cannot be confirmed as official mail-in ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existence of duplicate mail-in ballots automatically proves susceptibility to voter fraud. However, the expert explains that the system uses unique barcodes, and if a duplicate is scanned, it would be marked as rejected. Therefore, the assumption that the duplicate ballots imply voter fraud is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the duplicate mail-in ballots, stating that it was due to a computer glitch during the printing process. This suggests that the existence of duplicate ballots may not be intentional or indicative of voter fraud.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the potential impact or consequences of the computer glitch that caused the printing error. The expert mentions that the incident was included in a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump's campaign, which claims that the fraudulent mail voting system will undermine the election results. However, the expert does not provide further analysis or discussion on the potential implications of the incident.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of the claim contradicting any established facts or evidence provided by the expert."}
