{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Levi Strauss announced they would be partnering with businessman Michael Bloomberg to advocate for gun control policies. The expert's verdict clarifies that the partnership was with Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded and funded by Michael Bloomberg, and the aim was gun violence prevention, not attacking gun rights.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Levi Strauss was targeting Second Amendment-supporting customers or aiming to get rid of the Second Amendment. The expert's verdict states that these characterizations were not true and were ascribed to the company by gun rights-supporting commentators.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support by not providing specific evidence or sources for the partnership between Levi Strauss and Michael Bloomberg. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information and sources to support their assessment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that partnering with Michael Bloomberg automatically means advocating for gun control policies. The expert's verdict clarifies that the partnership was focused on gun violence prevention and does not necessarily imply an attack on gun rights.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Levi Strauss' actions, such as their focus on gun violence prevention rather than gun control policies. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced perspective on the company's efforts."}
