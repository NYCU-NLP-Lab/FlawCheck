{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the speaker is the only candidate from either primary who said they would not raise taxes on the middle class, when in fact, there were other candidates who made similar promises.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the statement that the speaker is the only candidate who made this promise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the speaker's promise not to raise taxes on the middle class is unique and sets them apart from other candidates, without considering the promises made by other candidates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that other candidates from both the Democratic and Republican primaries also made promises not to raise taxes on the middle class."}
