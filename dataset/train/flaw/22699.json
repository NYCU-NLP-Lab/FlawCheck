{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of the tax plan on middle-class taxes by stating that it \"raises\" taxes without specifying the extent of the increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the tax plan will raise middle-class taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax plan will uniformly raise taxes for the middle class, without considering potential variations based on individual circumstances or specific state tax policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the potential alternative explanation that the tax plan may have mixed effects, benefiting some middle-class taxpayers while potentially increasing taxes for others.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts research groups across the political spectrum who agree that the middle class will benefit from provisions in the tax law, at least initially.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a definitive statement about the tax plan's impact on middle-class taxes before the final version of the bill was released. It may not have taken into account all the details and changes in the final version.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential negative impact of the tax plan on middle-class taxes by stating that it will be \"very difficult\" and that they will have to pay \"a lot more money.\" This exaggeration is not supported by the available evidence."}
