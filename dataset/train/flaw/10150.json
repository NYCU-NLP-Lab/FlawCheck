{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Joe Biden's role in the taxation of Social Security by stating that he \"successfully voted in favor of taxing 50% of social security\" and that he was the deciding vote in raising taxes from 50% to 85%. The expert's verdict clarifies that Biden was one of 88 senators who voted for a bipartisan bill in 1983, and that the decision to tax Social Security was part of a broader effort to address the program's financial challenges.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden's support for taxing Social Security in the past means that he wants to tax 401k's and IRA's now. The expert's verdict states that the claim twists Biden's proposals on retirement contributions, suggesting that there is a problematic assumption being made about his current stance on taxation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim references page 78 of the Democrats' platform as the source for the information, but the expert's verdict does not mention any specific support or evidence provided on that page. Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that prior to 1983, Social Security was not taxable. The expert's verdict explains that a bipartisan commission recommended taxing Social Security benefits for recipients with income above a certain threshold, leading to the amendments in the Social Security program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a simplified and misleading explanation of Joe Biden's role in the taxation of Social Security. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by highlighting the bipartisan effort and the broader context of addressing the program's financial challenges during that time."}
