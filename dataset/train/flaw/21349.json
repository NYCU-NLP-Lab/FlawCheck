{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Joe Biden's position on funding for law enforcement by stating that he would \"absolutely cut funding for law enforcement,\" which is not entirely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden's statement about well-armed police becoming the enemy means that he wants to cut funding for law enforcement, which is a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Joe Biden said he would cut funding for law enforcement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict, which states that Biden opposes defunding the police and has proposed more federal funding for community policing."}
