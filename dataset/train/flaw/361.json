{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the risk of a child contracting a fatal case of heartworm from kissing and sleeping with a dog. The expert's verdict clarifies that humans are not suitable hosts for Dirofilaria species, and infections in humans are quite uncommon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph actually shows the heart of a dog infected with heartworm, not a human child.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post and does not provide any credible evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the child's death was directly caused by sleeping and kissing the dog, without considering other possible factors or medical conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that humans become infected with Dirofilaria through mosquito bites, not physical contact with infected canines."}
