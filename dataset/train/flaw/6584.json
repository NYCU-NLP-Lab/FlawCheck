{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which jobs involving the minimum wage are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the workforce. While young people do make up a significant portion of minimum wage workers, the claim may overstate their prevalence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the presence of minimum wage workers who are not young people starting out in the workforce. The expert's analysis suggests that there are also college-age youths and other individuals who fall into the minimum wage category.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to establish that jobs involving the minimum wage are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the workforce. The expert's analysis provides some data on the demographics of minimum wage workers, but it does not provide a comprehensive picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that jobs involving the minimum wage are primarily held by young people starting out in the workforce. This assumption may not hold true for all cases and may overlook other factors contributing to the prevalence of minimum wage workers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the demographic composition of minimum wage workers. It solely focuses on young people starting out in the workforce without exploring other possible factors influencing their representation."}
