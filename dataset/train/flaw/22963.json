{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows homeless people in Los Angeles is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the photo was taken in Paris.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading photo and does not provide any additional evidence or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that shanties and slums like the ones depicted in the photo can only be found in Africa, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict is that the photo shows a slum between the Porte de Clignancourt and the Porte de la Chapelle in Paris, inhabited by Roma communities."}
