{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the pictures used to support it were found to be misleading and taken out of context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the killings mentioned are solely carried out by Fulani herdsmen, without providing concrete evidence or considering alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the pictures used were not related to the alleged Fulani killings on the Abuja-Jos road, but rather to a separate incident involving the abduction and killing of a traditional ruler.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the killings mentioned, such as the ongoing violence between Fulani herders and Christian farmers in the region, which is not specifically mentioned in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent or frequency of the Fulani killings on the Abuja-Jos road, as the evidence provided does not directly support this specific claim."}
