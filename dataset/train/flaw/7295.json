{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Merrick Garland is investigating Donald Trump's tax evasion case lacks support as there is no evidence or official announcement to substantiate this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Merrick Garland has a personal motive for investigating Trump's tax evasion case based on past events, but there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump has not been charged with tax evasion. The investigation mentioned in the claim is related to the president's financial records and potential tax fraud, not tax evasion specifically.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and legal process involved in the investigation of Trump's financial records. It simplifies the situation by attributing it solely to Garland's involvement, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is the ongoing investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee into Trump's financial information. The claim falsely attributes this investigation solely to Garland."}
