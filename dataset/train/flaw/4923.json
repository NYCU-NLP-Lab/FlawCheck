{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the NC elections board did not change state law. While they may not have made permanent changes to the law, they did enact changes to absentee ballot rules through a legal settlement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of permanent changes to state law means that the elections board did not change the law at all. However, the board did have the power to make temporary changes to the process through emergency powers granted by state law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to assert that the elections board did not change state law. The provided information suggests that changes were made to absentee ballot rules, but it does not explicitly address whether the board made changes to the state law itself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that while the elections board did not change state law directly, they did have the authority to make temporary changes to the process through emergency powers granted by state law. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the board did not change state law at all."}
