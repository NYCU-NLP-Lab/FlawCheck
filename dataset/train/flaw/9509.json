{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of people on Medicaid who are children, seniors, or have a disability. The expert's verdict states that \"two-thirds of the Medicaid population\" consists of these groups, indicating a higher proportion than what the claim implies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled.\" The expert's verdict provides enrollment data from 2014 and 2016, but it does not specify the percentage or number of people falling under each category.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of children, seniors, or disabled individuals on Medicaid. The expert's verdict mentions that the share of children on Medicaid is a reflection of the number of children living in poverty, suggesting that poverty rates may be a contributing factor.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that one-third of New York state residents are on Medicaid, indicating that a significant portion of the Medicaid population consists of non-children, non-senior, and non-disabled individuals.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the proportion of children, seniors, and disabled individuals on Medicaid. While the claim implies that the majority of Medicaid recipients fall under these categories, the expert's verdict states that it is \"almost two-thirds\" or about 65 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the demographics of the Medicaid population. The expert's verdict provides more detailed enrollment data, which suggests that the claim's broad categorization may oversimplify the diversity within the Medicaid population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of people on Medicaid are children, seniors, or disabled, without considering other potential demographics or factors contributing to Medicaid enrollment."}
