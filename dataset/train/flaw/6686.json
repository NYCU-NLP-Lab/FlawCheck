{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the actual number of mailboxes that were removed during the Obama administration. The expert's verdict states that the number of mail collection boxes declined by more than 12,000 nationally from 2011 to 2016, whereas the claim only mentions \"thousands\" of mailboxes being removed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that thousands of mailboxes were removed during the last Obama administration term. The expert's verdict mentions a report from 2016, but it does not specify if this report directly supports the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of mailboxes during the Obama administration was politically motivated, without providing any evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict states that it is difficult to prove if the removal was politically motivated or connected to elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in the number of mailboxes during the Obama years appeared to have little to do with politics. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the removal of mailboxes, such as underuse or other operational reasons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim implies that the removal of mailboxes during the Obama administration was solely based on a 2016 report, while the expert's verdict provides additional information and context that contradicts this assumption."}
