{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of fraudulent votes by stating that there were 170, while the expert's verdict clarifies that there were only 164 voters with listed birthdates of 1 January 1800 or 1 January 1900, which were placeholder values and not indicative of voter fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion of fraudulent votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of voters with birthdates earlier than 1902 indicates fraudulent voting, while the expert's verdict explains that these birthdates were placeholders and not evidence of fraud.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the presence of voters with birthdates earlier than 1902 can be explained by the fact that some voters were not required to provide birthdate information at the time of registration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the listed birthdates of 1 January 1800 or 1 January 1900 were not indicative of fraud, as explained by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as there is no specific information provided to assess this bias.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information."}
