{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm the connection between the father posting a picture of his baby with a gun and the subsequent need for a 911 call due to a self-inflicted gunshot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the father's Facebook post and the baby shooting herself, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the two images (the one with the baby holding a gun and the one with people gathered around a tiny coffin) are not associated with each other. The pairing of these images was done to create a meme, suggesting that the claim is misleading.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and coherent narrative, as it includes unrelated information about a Juggalo-themed talk radio program and an interview with a Chicago woman that veers off-topic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents alternative explanations for the funeral image, suggesting that it may not be related to the alleged incident of the baby shooting herself."}
