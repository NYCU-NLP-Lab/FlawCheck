{"Contradict fact": "The claim of Six Flags offering five free passes and unlimited free rides to everyone contradicts the fact that free pass scams are common and Six Flags has warned about ticket scammers in the past.", "Lack enough support": "There is no evidence found on the Six Flags website about the company offering five free passes to everyone.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the offer of free passes and unlimited rides is authentic without providing any proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The post on the website \"Local Airlines Fare\" does not mention free passes again and instead discusses buying a season pass and Knoebels amusement park, suggesting an alternative explanation."}
