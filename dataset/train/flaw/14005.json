{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which prosecutions or cases on access to public records have increased in the past three years compared to the previous 12 years combined. This bias is suggested by the expert's statement that there is a \"troubling level of non-compliance\" with the state's open records law, indicating that there may have been ongoing issues with access to public records for a longer period of time.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear comparison between the current situation and the previous 12 years. The expert's statement mentions that public bodies vote in secret, deals are cut behind closed doors, and police departments withhold arrest records, indicating a long-standing problem with access to public records. Therefore, the claim may not fully acknowledge the historical context and ongoing challenges.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there have been more prosecutions or cases on access to public records in the past three years compared to the previous 12 years combined. The expert's statement only provides a list of civil lawsuits filed by different attorneys general, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison of the number and outcomes of these cases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of prosecutions or cases on access to public records is a direct measure of the effectiveness of enforcement and compliance with open records laws. This assumption may overlook other factors that could contribute to non-compliance or limited access to public records, such as lack of resources, inadequate training, or systemic issues within public bodies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in prosecutions or cases on access to public records in the past three years. The claim attributes it to an ongoing problem, but it does not consider other factors that could have influenced the increase, such as changes in legislation, policy priorities, or enforcement strategies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were previous cases on access to public records filed by the predecessors of the incumbent attorney general. The expert's statement mentions civil lawsuits filed by both Patrick Lynch and Sheldon Whitehouse during their respective tenures as attorney general. Therefore, the claim's assertion that there were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002 is contradicted by the available information."}
