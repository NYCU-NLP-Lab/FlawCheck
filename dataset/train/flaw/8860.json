{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell was married to Joe Purcell, a former Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas who served under Bill Clinton. The expert's verdict does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to confirm this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a connection between Helen Purcell's alleged marriage to Joe Purcell and her decision to close polling places, suggesting that her ties to the Clintons influenced her actions. However, there is no direct evidence or logical reasoning provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the long voting lines in Arizona, attributing it to \"bad decisions\" made by Helen Purcell. This suggests that the claim's assertion of deliberate voter suppression may not be the only explanation for the situation."}
