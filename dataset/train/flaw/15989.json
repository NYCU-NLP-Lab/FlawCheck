{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Bill de Blasio is \"banning hot dog sales to stop climate change.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the city is only phasing out its purchase of processed meat, not banning hot dog sales.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that hot dog sales are being banned to stop climate change.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by phasing out processed meat purchases are solely aimed at stopping climate change, without considering other factors such as health.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the city's decision to phase out processed meat purchases, such as health concerns or sustainability.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual intentions of the city's plan, as it only focuses on the hot dog sales aspect and ignores the broader goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting more sustainable practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the city is not banning hot dog sales, but rather phasing out its own purchase of processed meat.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times, as there is no specific evidence provided to evaluate its consistency or accuracy."}
