{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Russ Feingold \"got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University.\" However, the expert's verdict reveals that Feingold was paid $150,000 by Stanford in 2015, which was divided among multiple lectures. The actual amount per lecture is approximately $7,895, which is slightly lower than the claim's figure of $8,000.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim provides evidence from Feingold's personal financial disclosure form and the description of the class he taught at Stanford. However, it does not provide additional sources or documentation to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Feingold was paid $8,000 per lecture at Stanford University. However, the expert's verdict reveals that the university does not pay per lecture and that Feingold had additional responsibilities outside of the lectures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Feingold's duties at Stanford included teaching but also many other responsibilities. This suggests that his compensation may have been based on a broader scope of work rather than solely on the number of lectures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of faltering bias in the provided claim."}
