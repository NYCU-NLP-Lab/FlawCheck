{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, suggesting that it would be enough to rebuild every inner city in America.", "Lack enough support": "The Trump campaign did not provide specific spending numbers to support the claim, and the available information suggests that the cost of resettling refugees would be much lower than the cost of rebuilding every inner city.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money allocated for refugees could be directly used for rebuilding inner cities, without considering other budgetary priorities or the specific needs of each.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of funds, such as investing in infrastructure, education, or social programs within inner cities."}
