{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of people on death row who have completed their appellate review and are awaiting the governor's signature on a death warrant. The expert's verdict mentions that approximately 40 persons fit this description, which could be seen as a smaller number compared to the actual count.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only factor causing delays in death penalty cases is the governor's office not signing death warrants. The expert's verdict suggests that Democrats argue that the appeals process itself may not be the sole cause of delays, implying that there could be other factors at play.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that approximately 40 persons on death row have completed their appellate review and are awaiting the governor's signature. The expert's verdict mentions that they were unable to find concrete information or confirmation from relevant agencies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the delays in death penalty cases, such as the appeals process or other factors. This implies that the claim's focus solely on the governor's signature may overlook other contributing factors.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the expert's verdict does not provide evidence of any factual contradictions."}
