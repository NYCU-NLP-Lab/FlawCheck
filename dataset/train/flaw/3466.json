{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"The bottom 60 percent haven't seen a raise since 1980\" is an exaggeration. Analyses of Census data by nonpartisan sources show that there has been a rise in inflation-adjusted wages over that time period, although the percentage increase was relatively small.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the findings of nonpartisan sources like the Congressional Research Service and the Economic Policy Institute, which have analyzed Census data to show that there has been some wage increase for the bottom 60 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there has been no wage increase at all for the bottom 60 percent since 1980, which is a problematic assumption given the evidence from nonpartisan sources that show some increase, albeit relatively small.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the magnitude of the wage increase for the bottom 60 percent. While the increase may have been relatively small compared to higher-income earners, it is still important to consider and acknowledge the actual wage growth experienced by this group.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that while there has been some wage increase for the bottom 60 percent since 1980, the growth has been slower than expected in an economy with relatively low unemployment. This suggests that there are underlying factors contributing to slower wage growth for this group.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there has been some wage increase for the bottom 60 percent since 1980, as supported by analyses of Census data by nonpartisan sources."}
