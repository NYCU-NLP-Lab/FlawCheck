{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which students in Milwaukee Public Schools are behind in reading and math. While the claim states that \"86 percent are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math,\" it is important to note that these figures are based on recalculations that raised expectations for performance. The recalibration resulted in a significant increase in the number of students rated as non-proficient, even though their performance on the test didn't change.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to validate the percentages provided. The evidence cited by the person making the claim is an article from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that reports on recalculations done by the Department of Public Instruction. While the figures mentioned in the claim align with the recalculations, it is unclear if these recalculations accurately reflect the proficiency levels of students in Milwaukee Public Schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the recalculations done by the Department of Public Instruction accurately reflect the proficiency levels of students in Milwaukee Public Schools. However, it is important to consider alternative explanations and factors that may influence student performance, such as the quality of education, resources, and socio-economic factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentages of non-proficient students in Milwaukee Public Schools. The spokesperson for the school district points out that the percentages of non-proficient students in voucher or choice schools are even higher. This alternative explanation suggests that there may be broader systemic issues affecting student performance beyond just the public school system.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the performance of Milwaukee Public Schools students. While it highlights the high percentages of students rated as non-proficient, it does not delve into the reasons behind these results or consider other factors that may contribute to student performance.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
