{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Ted Cruz's money comes from Washington and outside the state of Texas. The expert's analysis shows that Cruz received 35% of his campaign proceeds from outside the state, which is significant but not necessarily \"most\" of his money.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the amount of money Ted Cruz received from outside the state of Texas. The expert's analysis shows that Cruz raised more than $1.5 million from more than 1,000 out-of-state donors, which suggests a significant portion of his funding comes from outside Texas.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"most\" of Ted Cruz's money comes from Washington and outside the state of Texas. The expert's analysis indicates that Cruz received 35% of his campaign proceeds from outside the state, but it does not provide a clear breakdown of the sources of his funding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that money from Washington and outside the state of Texas is inherently negative or undesirable. However, the expert's analysis does not evaluate the potential implications or consequences of receiving funding from these sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the sources of Ted Cruz's funding. The expert's analysis provides some information about the breakdown of his campaign contributions but does not explore other potential factors or influences on his fundraising efforts."}
