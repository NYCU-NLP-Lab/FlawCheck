{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which it was illegal to pass as a white person in history, as experts state that there were never explicit laws prohibiting African-Americans from passing as white.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that it was generally illegal to pass as a white person, which experts argue is not entirely accurate. While there were consequences for those discovered passing as white, it was due to laws that applied to African-Americans, not specific laws against passing as white.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the assertion that it was illegal for most black people in history to pass as white and that they would be put in jail if they tried to do so.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the consequences faced by individuals passing as white, such as the application of laws on the books for African-Americans rather than specific laws against passing as white."}
