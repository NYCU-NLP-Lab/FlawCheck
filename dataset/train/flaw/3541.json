{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which America consumes global oil reserves. The expert's verdict states that while the claim is in the right ballpark, it is a little low. This suggests that the claim exaggerates the consumption percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim. The expert's verdict relies on data from the Energy Information Administration to verify the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies on outdated statistics provided by Connolly's office. The expert's verdict states that the numbers provided by Connolly's office were from between 1999 and 2004, making them out of date.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that America owning 3 percent of the world's oil and consuming 25 percent of its global reserves is disproportionate. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account other factors such as population size, economic activity, and energy demands.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for America's high oil consumption. It solely focuses on the percentage comparison between ownership and consumption without exploring other factors that contribute to the difference."}
