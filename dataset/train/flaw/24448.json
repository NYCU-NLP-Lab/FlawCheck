{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that enrollment drop significantly in states that have passed campus carry laws. The evidence provided only mentions a decline in international student enrollment in Texas, and it is not clear if campus carry was the primary factor driving the decline.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between the passage of campus carry laws and a significant drop in enrollment. However, this assumption is not adequately supported by the evidence provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the impact of campus carry laws on enrollment. The evidence presented only focuses on one state (Texas) and does not provide a broader perspective on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decline in enrollment, such as other factors influencing international student enrollment or other state-specific circumstances.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of campus carry laws on enrollment by only focusing on international student enrollment and not considering the potential concerns and reactions of domestic students.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
