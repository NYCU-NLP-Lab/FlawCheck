{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Michelle Nunn praised the Occupy movement. The only reference provided is an op-ed written by Nunn in The Washington Post that contained a few references to the Occupy movement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that praising the Occupy movement automatically makes Nunn \"dangerously out of touch\" with voters in Georgia, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Nunn's references to the Occupy movement in her op-ed, such as acknowledging the movement's concerns without necessarily endorsing or praising it.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the NRSC is eager to tell Georgians about Nunn's supposed extreme record of praising radical liberal groups like the Occupy movement. This suggests that the claim may falter at times by using exaggerated language to characterize Nunn's views.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any potential biases of understating in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate Nunn's praise of the Occupy movement, as the only evidence provided is a few references in an op-ed.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not mention any contradictions with established facts in the claim."}
