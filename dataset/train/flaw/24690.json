{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is unclear which districts and schools were invited and whether some chose not to attend.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for not inviting racially-diverse area school districts was due to racial bias without concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why certain districts were not invited, such as logistical constraints or scheduling conflicts, which are not explored in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of tickets provided to traditional public schools, public charter schools, private schools, and homeschool families, as it only mentions \"hundreds of tickets\" without providing a specific number.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who said that tickets were sent out to all the schools in the area."}
