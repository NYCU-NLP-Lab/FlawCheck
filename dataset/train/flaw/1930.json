{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in funding received by New York compared to Montana and Nebraska. It states that New York is only receiving about $12,000 per case, while Montana and Nebraska are receiving more than $300,000 per case. However, the claim fails to provide enough evidence or context to support this exaggerated difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that New York is only receiving about $12,000 per case. It does not provide specific data or information on how the funding is allocated and distributed among the states.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the federal stimulus money should be distributed solely based on the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each state. However, there may be other factors and considerations involved in the allocation of funds, such as population size, healthcare infrastructure, and the severity of the outbreak.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in funding received by New York compared to Montana and Nebraska. It does not take into account other funding sources or programs that may be available to New York, or the specific criteria used to allocate funds to different states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that subsequent batches of funding are supposed to favor states with higher coronavirus case loads. This suggests that the initial funding discrepancy mentioned in the claim may not be representative of the overall distribution of funds.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the funding allocation process and the specific factors that determine the amount of funding received by each state. It simplifies the issue by focusing solely on the reported number of COVID-19 cases, which may not be the only determining factor.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexity of the funding allocation process and the various factors that influence the amount of funding received by each state. It oversimplifies the issue by solely focusing on the reported number of COVID-19 cases, without considering other relevant factors."}
