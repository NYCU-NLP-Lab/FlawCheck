{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the danger of gabapentin by stating that it is the most dangerous drug in America and will surpass opioids as the largest prescription drug killer. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the drug is not a direct overdose risk and that its adverse effects have been considered few.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support its assertion that gabapentin is the most dangerous drug in America. The expert's verdict mentions that claims of gabapentin killing thousands are based on a viral Facebook post without sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that gabapentin will surpass opioids as the largest prescription drug killer without providing evidence or reasoning for this assumption. The expert's verdict does not support this assumption and instead provides information about the drug's use and abuse.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in abuse of gabapentin, such as the potential role of opioid addiction and the ability of gabapentin to enhance the euphoric effects of opioids. The expert's verdict mentions that larger scale studies have confirmed this link between gabapentin and opioid addiction."}
