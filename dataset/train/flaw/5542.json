{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of pandemic aid received by Canadians. While some Canadians did receive $2,000 per month through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), this was not the case for all Canadians.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to accurately represent the pandemic aid provided in Canada. It only focuses on one specific program (CERB) and does not consider other forms of aid or changes in benefits over time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Canadians received the same amount of pandemic aid, which is not true. The amount of aid varied depending on individual circumstances and eligibility criteria.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the differences in pandemic aid between Canada and the US. It does not take into account the different economic and political contexts of the two countries."}
