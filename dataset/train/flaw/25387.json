{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the crab swarming on the Florida road after Hurricane Irma. The expert's verdict mentions that the video claimed to be \"live\" footage, but it was actually on a loop and potentially unrelated to Hurricane Irma.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the occurrence of crabs swarming onto a Florida road after Hurricane Irma. The expert's verdict mentions that the video in question has been taken down, and attempts to seek comments from relevant authorities have not been successful.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the crabs featured in the video more closely resemble crustaceans that migrate en masse in other regions, such as Christmas Island or Cuba's Bay of Pigs. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the claim's accuracy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the crab migrations in the central part of Florida involve giant land crabs, commonly known as \"blue crabs.\" The crabs featured in the video do not match this description, according to the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of its accuracy and reliability due to the lack of supporting evidence, contradictory information, and the questionable credibility of the source (EBUZZ.buzz)."}
