{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"investing over $100 million in worker training\" is an exaggeration. The governor's actual investment was $132 million from various sources, including nearly $100 million in state money, for a range of job training initiatives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence to back up the statement of investing over $100 million in worker training.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the funding cuts made by Governor Walker were directly related to worker training, which is not the case. The reductions in funding were in general aid, which can be used for various purposes including worker training, but also for general education and overhead costs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the reduction in funding for technical colleges. It is mentioned that some of the reductions were offset by savings resulting from collective bargaining reform, indicating that there may be other factors contributing to the funding cuts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were cuts in general state aid for technical colleges in Governor Walker's budget, which suggests that the investment in worker training may not have been as significant as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual investment in worker training by not accounting for additional funding sources and initiatives beyond the $100 million mentioned.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing consistent and clear information about the actual investment in worker training and the impact of funding cuts on technical colleges."}
