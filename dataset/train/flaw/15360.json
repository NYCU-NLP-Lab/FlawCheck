{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost of Nigeria's election budget by comparing it to India's 2014 poll cost. The difference of only $25 million is presented as significant, even though the budgets of the two countries may have different factors and contexts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any supporting evidence or data to explain why Nigeria's election budget is $625 million or why India's 2014 poll cost $600 million. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of an election budget is directly proportional to the voting population. It states that Nigeria's voting population is six times smaller than India's, implying that the difference in budget is justified. However, this assumption may not hold true as there are various factors that can influence the cost of an election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the difference in election budgets between Nigeria and India. There could be other factors, such as differences in infrastructure, security requirements, or political dynamics, that contribute to the disparity in costs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nigeria's election budget is $625 million and India's 2014 poll cost $600 million. However, without further evidence or context, it is challenging to determine if this contradiction is significant or if there are any inaccuracies in the claim."}
