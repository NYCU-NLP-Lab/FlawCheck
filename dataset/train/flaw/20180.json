{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that \"attitude adjustment\" and \"smile therapy\" were forced upon American housewives in the 1930s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image depicts a woman undergoing \"attitude adjustment\" and \"smile therapy\" in a mental institution, which is a problematic assumption as there is no evidence to support this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the image, mentioning a 2014 urban legend about a \"smile club\" in Hungary. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion about American housewives and mental institutions.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's investigation contradicts the claim by stating that the image does not appear to depict a patient in a mental institution, but rather a woman in street clothes, jewelry, styled hair, and makeup.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity and prevalence of the alleged practices, suggesting that women could be institutionalized and subjected to shock therapy for not taking care of themselves or acting depressed, without sufficient evidence to support this exaggeration."}
