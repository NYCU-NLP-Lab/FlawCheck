{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the concept of a \"smart\" passport by suggesting that it will be an \"All-In-One Identity solution\" for every Indian citizen, without providing sufficient evidence or support for such a claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to validate the existence of a new \"smart\" passport in India. The only information provided is a viral message on social media platforms, which may not be reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the concept design created by Siddhant Gupta for a passport card is an indication of a soon-to-be-launched smart passport in India. However, this assumption may be problematic as there is no concrete evidence or official announcement supporting it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the claim could be that the concept design created by Siddhant Gupta is being misinterpreted or misrepresented as a soon-to-be-launched smart passport in India. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the reality of the situation."}
