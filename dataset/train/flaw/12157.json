{"Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the threat posed by CPS to remove children if residents refuse to pay for contaminated water. The expert's verdict mentions that Michigan law considers parents neglectful if they do not have running water in their home and that they could be guilty of child endangerment if they refuse to pay for water they cannot drink. This suggests that there is a real threat to residents regarding the removal of their children.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples of residents being threatened by CPS with the removal of their children if they refuse to pay for contaminated water. The expert's verdict mentions that activists in Flint say that some residents have received similar threats, but it does not provide concrete evidence or sources to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that CPS is threatening residents with the removal of their children solely based on their refusal to pay for contaminated water. The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or information to support or refute this assumption. It is possible that there could be other factors or reasons involved in CPS's actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the threat of CPS removing children if residents refuse to pay for contaminated water. The expert's verdict also does not offer any alternative explanations for this claim. It is possible that there could be other reasons or factors involved in CPS's actions, but without further information, it is difficult to determine."}
