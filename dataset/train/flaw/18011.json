{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Wisconsin has the \"most diminished middle class\" in the entire country without providing sufficient evidence to support this extreme assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a single analysis from 2015 by the Pew Research Center, which only goes up until 2013. More recent data is available but not considered in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the decline in middle-class households in Wisconsin is the highest in the country based on the Pew analysis, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in middle-class households in Wisconsin, such as changes in the economy, job market, or other socio-economic factors that may have influenced the decrease.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on statements from politicians, which may be influenced by political biases or agendas rather than objective data or analysis.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the situation by not considering more recent data or comprehensive analysis to determine the current state of Wisconsin's middle class.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Wisconsin has the \"most diminished middle class\" in the entire country by not considering more recent data that could potentially show different results."}
