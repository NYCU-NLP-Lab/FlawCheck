{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that commenting with the word 'gratula' on Facebook verifies the safety of an account, which is an exaggerated statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or support to prove that commenting with the word 'gratula' on Facebook actually verifies the safety of an account.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the word 'gratula' is a new word created by Mark Zuckerberg to ensure account safety, which is not true. The word 'gratula' means 'congrats' in Hungarian and is not related to account security.", "Contradict fact": "Facebook has explicitly stated that posting a specific word to Facebook does not secure an account, contradicting the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the phenomenon of the word 'gratula' turning red or not on Facebook, such as technical glitches or design features."}
