{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph by referring to Nehru as \"the hero of the Indian National Congress\" and comparing him to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Nehru was being kissed by a lady from behind. The provided photograph and video evidence show that the kiss was on the cheek and was given by Nehru's niece.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the photograph shows a family moment between Nehru, his niece, and her mother, who was the High Commissioner to the UK at the time.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph was debunked as false and misleading by Alt News and BJP IT Cell Head Amit Malviya.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately portraying the context and details of the photograph, as it misrepresents the nature of the kiss and the identities of the individuals involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that sharing false and photoshopped images is an intentional attempt to character assassinate Nehru.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
