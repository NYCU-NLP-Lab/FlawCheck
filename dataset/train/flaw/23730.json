{"Lack enough support": "The claim of 153 businesses moving from California to Texas lacks sufficient evidence to support it. The only source provided is a spokesperson for Governor Perry and an internal analysis by Dun & Bradstreet, which has not been shared outside the company.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 153 businesses counted by Dun & Bradstreet relocated from California to Texas, without considering the possibility of businesses opening new locations in Texas while keeping their headquarters in California.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual number of businesses that have moved from California to Texas, as the Dun & Bradstreet analysis only covers the period from January to August and does not include new business locations.", "Falters at times": "The claim is made by Governor Perry during his media appearances and book promotion, suggesting a potential bias towards promoting his own agenda or political narrative.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for businesses relocating from California to Texas, such as economic factors, tax incentives, or other business-friendly policies in Texas."}
