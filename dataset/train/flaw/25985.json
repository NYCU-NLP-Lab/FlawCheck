{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of someone else claiming a person's children for income tax purposes on their eligibility for a stimulus check. The expert's verdict clarifies that regardless of who claimed the children as dependents, the person should still be eligible for a direct payment as long as they meet the income requirements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if someone else claimed a person's children for income tax purposes, they will receive the stimulus check. However, the expert's verdict explains that this is not the case, as eligibility for the stimulus check depends primarily on income and the number of dependents claimed on tax returns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for who will receive the $500 payment for each qualifying dependent child. The expert's verdict explains that whoever claimed the child on the most recent tax return (either 2019 or 2018) will be eligible for the additional payment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up its assertion. The expert's verdict provides detailed information about the eligibility criteria for the stimulus check and the additional $500 payment for dependent children.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that individuals who are claimed as dependents are ineligible to receive a $1,200 payment, even if they are adults. The expert's verdict confirms this information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying the eligibility criteria for the stimulus check and the additional payment for dependent children. The expert's verdict highlights the complexity of determining who will receive the $500 payment.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
