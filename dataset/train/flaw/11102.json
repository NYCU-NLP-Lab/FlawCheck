{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the U.S. government is mandating all motorcycles to be outfitted with 75 MPH governors by January 2017.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the regulation it mentions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of the mandatory governor is to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75 miles per hour and aims to drastically reduce motorcycle fatalities, without providing any evidence or reasoning for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the regulation or any potential counterarguments against it."}
