{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by Muslims during Obama's first 18 months in office compared to the six years under Bush after the invasion of Iraq. The expert's verdict mentions that Coulter's terminology is quite specific and leaves out a lot of terrorist activity that occurred under both presidents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that there were more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by Muslims during Obama's first 18 months compared to the six years under Bush after the invasion of Iraq. The expert's verdict mentions that they looked into the claim to verify its accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of terrorist attacks is solely attributable to Muslims and implies a correlation between Obama's presidency and an increase in attacks. This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to terrorist activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of terrorist attacks, such as changes in global geopolitical dynamics, evolving tactics of terrorist organizations, or variations in counterterrorism strategies between administrations. The expert's verdict raises the question of what the U.S. can actually do to curb recruiting by jihadists, suggesting that there are other factors at play beyond the scope of the claim."}
