{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible source provided to confirm that a rail freight tanker had \"COVID-19\" stamped on one side.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"COVID-19\" label on the tanker is genuine without providing any proof or verification.", "Contradict fact": "The evidence presented by GATX, the Association of American Railroads, and RailInc contradicts the claim, stating that the image is manipulated and the \"COVID-19\" stencil does not exist."}
