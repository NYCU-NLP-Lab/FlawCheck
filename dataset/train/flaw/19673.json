{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks direct evidence or specific sources to support the statement that a zeppelin airship flew over Giza in Egypt in 1931. Although there is a viral photograph circulating on social media that supposedly shows a zeppelin airship flying above the Great Sphinx of Giza, the original source of the image is unknown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viral photograph depicts a zeppelin airship flying over Giza in 1931. While the photograph likely shows the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, an airship built in Germany in 1928, there is no direct evidence or confirmation that it specifically flew over Giza in 1931.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the viral photograph, such as the possibility that it depicts a different event or location unrelated to Giza in 1931. Without further evidence or information, it is difficult to determine the exact context and location of the photograph.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that airship travel was mostly grounded a few years after 1931, following the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. The expert's verdict mentions that airship travel was all but grounded after the Hindenburg disaster, suggesting that the claim's implication of continued zeppelin airship flights after 1931 is inaccurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of a zeppelin airship flying over Giza in 1931. While it is mentioned that the airship's journey was documented by a journalist and argued for the practicability and safety of dirigibles, it is unclear how widely recognized or impactful this specific event was in the broader context of airship travel."}
