{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to confirm that the photograph depicts a Salvation Army bellringer holding a sign stating the group helps people, \"just not the gays.\" The expert mentions that the photograph's origin is unknown, and there is no information about its subject, date, or context.", "Problematic assumption": "Some people interpreted the photograph to be that of an actual Salvation Army volunteer announcing the organization's views on its placard. However, the expert points out that early versions of the image universally identified the man with the sign as a protester of the Salvation Army, not a volunteer. Therefore, assuming the man is a volunteer could be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the photograph was originally presented as a protest and not a Salvation Army initiative. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the sign held by the individual in the photograph.", "Contradict fact": "The claim, as presented, contradicts the Salvation Army's \"no discrimination\" policy for LGBT individuals, which is detailed on their website. This policy contradicts the notion that the organization does not help the LGBTQ+ community.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and ambiguity surrounding the photograph by presenting it as a straightforward depiction of the Salvation Army's stance on helping the LGBTQ+ community."}
