{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Danny O'Connor has raised campaign funds from liberal out-of-staters. The expert's verdict states that O'Connor has received significant support from out-of-state donors, but it does not confirm the exact percentage mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that 90 percent of O'Connor's campaign funds come from liberal out-of-staters. The expert's verdict mentions that O'Connor has raised around $5.5 million with $1.3 million coming from all other states combined, but it does not provide a breakdown of how much of that comes from liberal out-of-state donors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that receiving a majority of campaign funds from liberal out-of-staters is inherently negative or problematic. This assumption may be biased as it implies that O'Connor's funding sources are undesirable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for O'Connor's fundraising success. It solely attributes it to receiving funds from liberal out-of-staters, while there could be other factors contributing to his fundraising advantage, such as strong grassroots support or effective campaign strategies.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the extent to which O'Connor has received support from out-of-state donors. The expert's verdict states that O'Connor is raising significant support from out-of-state donors, but it does not provide a specific percentage or breakdown of the funds.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and accurate representation of the situation. While it mentions the 90 percent figure, it does not provide sufficient evidence or context to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict. However, it may be misleading or incomplete in its representation of the situation by focusing solely on the percentage of funds from liberal out-of-staters without considering other aspects of O'Connor's fundraising."}
