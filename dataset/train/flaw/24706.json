{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of armed civilians stopping mass shootings, stating that an average of 2.5 people die when armed civilians intervene, compared to an average of 18 people dying when there is no armed civilian present. The actual numbers provided by different sources do not support this extreme difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the specific numbers mentioned. The sources cited by the expert offer different figures, and the sample size may be too small to draw definitive conclusions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that armed civilians are effective in stopping mass shootings and reducing the number of casualties. However, this assumption may not be universally true and can vary depending on various factors such as the training and preparedness of the armed civilians.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in casualty numbers. Factors such as law enforcement response time, the presence of security personnel, or other situational factors could also contribute to the variation in the number of casualties.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of a study that states shooting incidents resulting in 18 or more deaths are rare. This contradicts the claim's assertion that an average of 18 people die when there is no armed civilian present.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential effectiveness of law enforcement in stopping mass shootings. The expert's verdict mentions that the average number of people killed in mass shootings when the shooter is stopped by police is 18.25, which is higher than the claim's assertion of 2.5 deaths when armed civilians intervene.", "Falters at times": "The claim's basis on the numbers provided by different sources, which are not consistent, suggests that it may falter in providing a clear and accurate representation of the impact of armed civilians in stopping mass shootings."}
