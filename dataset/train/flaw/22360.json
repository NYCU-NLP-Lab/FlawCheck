{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Barack Obama in changing the stop and frisk policy in New York City. It implies that Obama personally sent moderators to oversee the policy, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for the change in stop and frisk policy was solely due to Obama's intervention, without considering other factors or influences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal link between Obama's involvement and the change in the stop and frisk policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence suggests that the decline in stop and frisk incidents was already occurring before the Obama administration's announcement, indicating that other factors may have contributed to the policy change."}
