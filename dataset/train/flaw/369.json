{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Donald Trump is the first sitting U.S. president in 56 years to not attend a wreath-laying ceremony on Veterans Day. The expert's verdict clarifies that several presidents before Trump have also not attended the ceremony at various times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides information from Snopes and CBS to support their conclusion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump is the first president in 56 years to not attend a wreath-laying ceremony on Veterans Day. However, this assumption is proven to be false by the expert's verdict, which provides examples of other presidents who have also not attended the ceremony.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for why Donald Trump did not attend the wreath-laying ceremony. The expert's verdict provides the explanation that Trump was elsewhere on that day, but it also highlights that other presidents have observed the holiday elsewhere as well."}
