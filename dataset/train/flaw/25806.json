It assumes that Nicaragua's reason for not signing was because the agreement \"wasn't tough enough,\" without exploring any other possible reasons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States, under President Donald Trump, also chose not to sign the Paris Agreement."}
