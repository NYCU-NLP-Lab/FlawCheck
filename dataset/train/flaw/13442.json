{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Pat McCrory's leadership on North Carolina's teacher pay ranking by stating that the state has \"fallen\" to 41st place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Pat McCrory's leadership directly caused the decline in teacher pay ranking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that teacher pay ranking is solely determined by the actions of the state government, disregarding the role of local school boards in supplementing salaries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative factors contributing to the decline in North Carolina's teacher pay ranking, such as changes in funding priorities or economic conditions, which are not addressed in the claim."}
