{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of undocumented immigrants being housed under the bridge by stating that \"hundreds\" of immigrant families were caged under the Paso Del Norte Bridge, while the expert's verdict does not provide specific numbers.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing accurate information about the location of the makeshift facility. It states that the facility was under a bridge in El Paso, Texas, while the expert's verdict mentions that the immigrants were being held in the parking lot of a Border Patrol station.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the statement that the Trump administration housed undocumented immigrants at a makeshift facility under a bridge. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information and sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for housing undocumented immigrants under the bridge was solely due to a backlog at the nearest official immigration center. The expert's verdict mentions that the border patrol station in El Paso was full, but it does not explicitly state that it was the only reason for housing immigrants under the bridge.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the undocumented immigrants were being held under the bridge, such as lack of available space in other detention facilities or logistical reasons. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations either."}
