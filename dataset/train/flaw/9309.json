{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Richard Cordray's failure to test rape kits, suggesting that it left serial rapists free to strike again and that testing all 12,000 kits led to hundreds of rapists being behind bars.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of local police departments in the backlog of untested rape kits, placing the blame mainly on Richard Cordray.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that testing all 12,000 rape kits led to hundreds of rapists being behind bars.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the backlog of untested rape kits can be solely attributed to Richard Cordray's failure, without considering other factors such as local police department policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that Richard Cordray started addressing the backlog as it gained attention and that he had limited time in office to fully address the issue."}
