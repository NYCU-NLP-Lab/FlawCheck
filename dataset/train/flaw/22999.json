{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the farmers' protest wants to establish Khalistan is an exaggeration.

The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a single picture shared on Facebook and Twitter without any substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all farmers participating in the protest are supporters of Khalistan, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim falsely suggests that the protest is being led by Sikhs who want to establish Khalistan, while the reality is that the protest represents a broader movement by farmers against the government's farm bills.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the farmers' protest is primarily focused on opposing the government's farm bills, rather than seeking to establish Khalistan. The expert's verdict highlights the misinformation and false narrative being spread about the protest.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that the picture of Sikhs supporting Khalistan is unrelated to the farmers' protest and was falsely linked to create a false narrative. The expert's verdict mentions that the image is from a different event that took place seven years ago and has no connection to the current protest.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the provided claim and expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim faltering at times in the expert's verdict."}
