{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph does not show Andrew McCabe being escorted out of the FBI building in January 2018.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph by suggesting it depicts McCabe's \"walk of shame\" and implies guilt.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that McCabe was forced out of the FBI or that he deserved embarrassment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCabe is guilty of something without providing evidence or justification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, stating that it was taken during McCabe's testimony before government committees, unrelated to his departure from the FBI."}
