{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the increase in CEO-to-worker pay ratio from 1968 to the present day. The expert's verdict mentions that the ratio in 1965 was about 20-to-1, while the claim states it was 20 times. Similarly, the claim states the current multiple is about 350, while the expert's verdict mentions it as 331 or 354 depending on the source.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim does not provide enough support for how the CEO-to-worker pay ratio for 1968 was determined. It is unclear how the specific ratio of 20 times was calculated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that different organizations and studies may provide varying estimates of CEO-to-worker pay ratios, indicating that there are alternative explanations and methodologies for calculating the ratio.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times in terms of accurately representing the CEO-to-worker pay ratio over time. The expert's verdict mentions different ratios for different years, indicating that the claim may not consistently represent the trend.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in CEO-to-worker pay ratio is problematic or concerning. While it may be a commonly held belief, it is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the increase in CEO-to-worker pay ratio from 1968 to the present day. The expert's verdict mentions ratios of 30-to-1 in 1970 and 331 or 354-to-1 in recent years, indicating a larger increase than the claim suggests.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact mentioned in the expert's verdict. However, the varying estimates and methodologies for calculating the CEO-to-worker pay ratio may indicate potential contradictions or discrepancies in different sources."}
