{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Stacey Abrams' statement by suggesting that she boasted about Democrats being able to \"jerry-rig the system\" and \"go around the Constitution\" to win the 2020 election. The expert's verdict clarifies that Abrams' comments were not about the 2020 election or securing a Democratic victory.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for its assertion that Stacey Abrams made these statements specifically about the 2020 election. The expert's verdict provides evidence that her comments were not in reference to the upcoming election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Abrams' statement about the National Popular Vote movement is a method for Democrats to secure victory in the 2020 election. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Abrams didn't characterize the effort as such and correctly points out that the proposal isn't new.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Abrams' statement, such as her long-standing opposition to the Electoral College and her belief that every American's vote should count, regardless of party affiliation."}
