{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the attribution of the quote to Mark Twain. There is no documentation or record of Twain ever saying or writing these words.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting has no impact and that those in power will act independently of citizen input. This assumption is not substantiated and can be subjective.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no verifiable evidence linking Mark Twain to the quote. It is a common misconception and misattribution.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the quote by attributing it to Mark Twain, a well-known and respected figure, even though there is no evidence to support this attribution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that other individuals, such as Phillip Berrigan and Emma Goldman, have also been credited with originating this expression, suggesting that there are alternative explanations for its origin."}
