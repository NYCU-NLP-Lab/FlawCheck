{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the idea that burning coal might produce future warming by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The only evidence provided is a brief story from a newspaper article in 1912.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the understanding of greenhouse gases and their potential impact on climate change existed in 1912. Some online commenters expressed skepticism over this assumption, suggesting that such a clear understanding may not have existed at that time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, other than burning coal. The claim does not consider other potential sources or factors contributing to carbon dioxide emissions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the understanding of greenhouse gases and their impact on climate change dates back to at least 1896, with the work of Svante Arrhenius. The claim implies that the concept of greenhouse gases and their role in climate change was not known until 1912.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the historical context and scientific understanding of greenhouse gases. It focuses on a single newspaper article from 1912 without considering other relevant scientific research and publications from that time.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance and impact of the newspaper article from 1912. While it is an interesting historical artifact, it may not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that burning coal could produce future warming by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere."}
