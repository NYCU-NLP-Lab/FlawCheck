{"Understate": "The claim may understate the positive changes that have occurred in Chicago's preschool program since Mayor Emanuel took office, such as the increase in full-day pre-K programs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the overall preschool program in Chicago is headed in the wrong direction under Mayor Emanuel.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decrease in pre-K enrollment alone indicates a decline in the quality or effectiveness of the preschool program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The decrease in pre-K enrollment could be explained by the overall decline in enrollment throughout the district, rather than solely attributed to Mayor Emanuel's policies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the preschool program in Chicago and fails to consider the positive changes that have been implemented under Mayor Emanuel's administration."}
