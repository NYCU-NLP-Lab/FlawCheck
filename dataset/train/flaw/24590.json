{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence to support the assertion that domestic dogs stand guard when their owners go to the bathroom as an evolutionary strategy inherited from wolves.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the behavior of domestic dogs following their owners into the bathroom is solely motivated by a protective instinct inherited from wolves, without considering other possible explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim acknowledges that the exact mechanisms underlying this behavior are poorly understood and contested within the scientific community, indicating a lack of consensus or certainty.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the behavior, suggesting that it is primarily a result of biological traits earned through evolution, while the expert's verdict suggests that it is more influenced by nurture and learned behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the behavior of dogs following their owners into the bathroom could be a result of social bonding, scent-marking behavior, or the desire to maintain eye contact and offer protection during vulnerable moments, rather than solely an evolutionary strategy inherited from wolves.", "Contradict fact": "The claim implies that the behavior of domestic dogs standing guard in the bathroom is a direct evolutionary strategy inherited from wolves, but the expert's verdict states that the exact mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood and contested within the scientific community."}
