{"Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may understate the extent of the gender pay gap by mentioning that the figures don't account for differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs.", "Lack enough support": "While the expert's verdict acknowledges that the claim is broadly correct, it also mentions that there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences in pay. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support to fully capture the complexity of the gender pay gap.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim doesn't account for factors such as the proportion of men and women in different occupations, which can affect the gender pay gap. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption that the gender pay gap is solely due to gender discrimination, without considering other contributing factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the gender pay gap is affected by factors such as the proportion of men and women in different occupations. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the gender pay gap beyond gender discrimination alone."}
