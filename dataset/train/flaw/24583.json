{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of Canadians visiting Florida and buying homes in the state. The expert's verdict provides data that suggests the actual percentage of Canadians visiting Florida is around 9 percent, not \"almost 10 percent.\" Similarly, the claim states that Canadians buy 7.4 percent of homes in Florida, while the expert's verdict indicates that they accounted for 36 percent of foreign sales in 2010.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific sources or data to support the percentages mentioned. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides information from Visit Florida and the National Association of Realtors, which offer more reliable data on Canadian visitors and home buyers in Florida.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of Canadians visiting Florida and buying homes in the state is significant enough to make a notable impact. However, the expert's verdict suggests that while Canadians are a significant portion of foreign home buyers in Florida, they do not make up the majority.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the percentage of Canadians visiting Florida and buying homes in the state. The expert's verdict provides additional context, such as the attractiveness of Florida's beaches and climate, as well as the affordability of properties, which may contribute to the high number of Canadian buyers."}
