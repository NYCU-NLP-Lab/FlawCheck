{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Harry Reid voted \"to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Reid's votes affected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal, not current illegals, and it was about changing the calculation process, not giving benefits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Harry Reid voted to give illegals Social Security benefits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that giving Social Security benefits to former illegal aliens is inherently wrong or problematic. This assumption is not supported or explored further in the provided information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Reid's votes affected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal, not current illegals. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion."}
