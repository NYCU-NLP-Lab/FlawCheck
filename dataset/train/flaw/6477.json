{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"99 percent of the time police officers aren't charged when they kill young people of color\" lacks sufficient statistical data to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the grand jury process is inherently biased in favor of police officers, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts mentioned that while the claim may have some accuracy, it does not necessarily indicate racial bias, as it is rare for any officer to be indicted regardless of the race of the victim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing concrete evidence or specific sources to back up the statistic, making it less reliable.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is a lack of accurate and comprehensive data on the number of police officers charged with homicide and the total number of people killed by police, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim."}
