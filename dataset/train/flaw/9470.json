{"Understate": "The claim may understate the urban population of Nigeria by stating that only 52% of the current population lives in urban areas. The expert's verdict mentions that Nigeria's urban population at independence was approximately 7 million, which suggests a higher urban population than the claim implies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to validate the specific percentage of 52% for Nigeria's urban population. The expert's verdict mentions that population figures in Nigeria have historically been controversial, and relying on United Nations and World Bank estimates is recommended.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of Nigeria's urban population is a fixed and accurate figure. However, the expert's verdict highlights the challenges and controversies surrounding population estimates in Nigeria, indicating that the assumption of a precise percentage may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the urban population percentage in Nigeria. However, the expert's verdict mentions that countries define urban areas differently, and the threshold for defining urban locals varies. This suggests that alternative explanations or variations in defining urban areas could exist.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not explicitly contradict any known facts. However, it may contradict the expert's verdict's emphasis on relying on United Nations and World Bank estimates for population figures, as the claim does not specify the source of the 52% statistic.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the urban population percentage in Nigeria. It provides a specific figure of 52%, which may be an accurate representation based on the available information.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it consistently presents the percentage of Nigeria's urban population as 52%. However, the lack of sufficient support or evidence for this percentage could be considered a potential flaw or weakness in the claim."}
