{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they made three requests to the National Association for Gun Rights for information supporting their claim about Rep. Scott Rigell, but received no response. This lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Rigell has dismissed the charge of supporting a federal gun registry as \"laughable.\" This suggests that the claim may falter at times.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the National Rifle Association (NRA) argues that expanding background checks will lead to a federal registry, but FactCheck.org has stated that this assumption is not accurate. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Rigell has stated in interviews that he would be willing to consider proposals for expanded or universal background checks. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for his stance on gun control, rather than supporting a federal registration system.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the federal government has been explicitly forbidden from keeping a registration system connecting most firearms to their owners since 1986. This contradicts the claim that Rep. Rigell wants gun owners in a federal registration system.", "Understate": "There is no evidence in the provided information to suggest that the claim may understate any information.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence in the provided information to suggest that the claim may exaggerate any information."}
