{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the FDA's actions by stating that the sale of CBD oils has been completely banned, when in reality the FDA has issued warning letters to manufacturers regarding impermissible label claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the FDA banned CBD oils because a drug company is interested in marketing them, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the FDA's actions are solely motivated by a drug company's interest in marketing CBD oils.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FDA's actions were focused on impermissible label claims and the invalid status of CBD as a dietary ingredient, rather than an outright ban on CBD oils.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making sweeping statements about the FDA's actions without providing specific examples or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the FDA's actions, such as concerns about the safety or efficacy of CBD oils."}
