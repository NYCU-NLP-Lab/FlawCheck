{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Disneyland is enforcing a \"no scream\" policy on roller coasters. The Facebook post mentioned in the claim is not verified, and there is no official statement from Disneyland confirming the policy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Disneyland has followed the example of a Japanese amusement park that encouraged riders to \"scream inside your heart\" to slow the spread of COVID-19. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as misinterpretation or misinformation. Other media organizations have recently reported incorrectly on the same topic and later corrected their information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the official blog post from Disneyland announcing the reopening of the park does not mention anything about a \"no scream\" policy on roller coasters.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information. The Facebook post mentioned in the claim is flagged as potentially false news, and Disneyland did not respond to inquiries about the post.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the situation by stating that Disneyland is \"enforcing\" a \"no scream\" policy, without sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
