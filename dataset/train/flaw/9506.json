{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it suggests that the image shows BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra eating on a footpath with a homeless couple, while it was actually a photoshopped image.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a photoshopped image that was debunked by BoomLive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photoshopped image depicts the failure of the Modi government, which may be a problematic assumption as the image itself is not genuine.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image is photoshopped, suggesting that it is a genuine representation of Patra's actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the photoshopped image was shared to criticize Patra's campaign efforts rather than to expose the failures of the Modi government."}
