{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or links to support the assertion that Facebook revised its position on female toplessness or nipple exposure in May 2017. The posts discussing the claim did not provide any supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there was a change in Facebook's policy regarding female toplessness, but the expert's verdict indicates that Facebook's Community Standards as of June 2017 did not show any changes in their policy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Facebook's policy on nudity, as it fails to mention the specific circumstances under which female nipples are allowed on the platform, such as breastfeeding or post-mastectomy scarring.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Facebook's policy on female toplessness or nipple exposure had not changed as of June 2017, according to a Facebook representative.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive understanding of Facebook's policy on nudity and fails to acknowledge the specific exceptions for non-sexual photos including female nipples.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rumors or posts about a change in Facebook's policy, such as misinformation or misinterpretation of existing guidelines."}
