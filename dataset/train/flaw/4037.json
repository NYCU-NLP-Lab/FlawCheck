{"Understate": "The claim states that Missouri maintains its highway system with \"one of the lowest levels of funding in the country.\" However, the expert's verdict reveals that Missouri actually ranks 48th nationally in revenue per mile, indicating a significant understatement of the funding situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the level of funding is the sole determinant of the quality and maintenance of Missouri's highway system. It does not take into account other factors that may contribute to the system's conditions.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by data from the Missouri Department of Transportation's Citizen's Guide on Transportation Funding, it does not provide additional evidence or context to fully support the assertion that Missouri has one of the lowest levels of funding in the country.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that Missouri ranks 26th in highway funding revenue when evaluating total funding. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the perceived low funding level, such as the allocation of funds or other factors influencing the ranking.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Missouri has one of the largest highway systems in the country, which receives a great deal of strain due to its geographical location.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration as it presents Missouri's funding level as one of the lowest in the country without providing a comprehensive comparison to all other states. It only mentions Rhode Island and Vermont as potential comparisons, but not other states with potentially lower funding levels.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of accurately representing the funding situation in Missouri. While it highlights the low revenue per mile, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall funding and its effectiveness in maintaining the highway system."}
