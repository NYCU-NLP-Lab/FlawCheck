{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Tony Evers will \"raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon\" may be an exaggeration, as Evers has only stated that he would consider raising the tax some amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the Walker campaign did not cite any new statements from Evers to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Evers will raise the gas tax by up to $1 per gallon, despite Evers stating that he has no range in terms of how high of an increase he would consider and calling a $1 increase \"ridiculous\".", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as Evers has stated that he would support looking at various revenue sources, including gas taxes, but has not specifically mentioned a $1 increase."}
