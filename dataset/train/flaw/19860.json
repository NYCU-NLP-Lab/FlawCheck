{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Constitution was not amended to prevent Roosevelt's reelection.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the amendment limiting presidents to two terms was introduced and passed by the GOP-controlled Congress in 1947, two years after Roosevelt died in office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific examples of why the Constitution was amended to prevent Roosevelt's reelection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the popularity of the New Deal was the sole reason for the amendment to limit presidential terms, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the amendment, such as Roosevelt's unprecedented time in office and his Republican opponent Thomas Dewey's support for term limits."}
