{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the helicopters in the photos are the first Nigerian-made helicopters contradicts the fact that no helicopters have been made in Nigeria since the agreement with Dynali was announced in 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation provided to substantiate the claim that these helicopters are Nigerian-made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the helicopters in the photos are Nigerian-made based on their presence in Nigeria, without providing any concrete evidence or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the helicopters in the photos are not Nigerian-made but are actually from Dynali, a Belgian aircraft manufacturing firm, as evidenced by the reverse image searches and metadata analysis.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photos by stating that they show the first Nigerian-made helicopters, when in fact they are unrelated to the Nigerian government's collaboration with Dynali."}
