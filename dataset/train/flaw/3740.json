{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of funding provided by President Obama to the Wuhan lab. The correct amount is $598,500 spread over five years, not $3,800,000.", "Understate": "The claim understates the funding received by the Wuhan lab from the U.S. government. The lab received about $600,000 over five years, not $3,800,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided to back up the assertion that the Wuhan lab was created by President Obama or that it directly links him to all 150,000 deaths worldwide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the Wuhan lab was created to intentionally manufacture the COVID-19 virus. The best genetic analysis to date suggests that the virus was not created in a lab.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the funding provided to the Wuhan lab, such as the grant being part of an effort to spot viruses in wildlife that might jump and infect humans.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the genetic sequence of the virus shows no signs of genetic engineering, undermining the conspiracy theory that the Wuhan lab intentionally created the virus.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information about the funding and linking it to President Obama without sufficient evidence or context."}
