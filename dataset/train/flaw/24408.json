{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Kamala Harris did not place her hand on the Bible while being sworn in is contradicted by evidence that she used two Bibles during her swearing-in ceremony.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Harris did use two Bibles during her swearing-in, which suggests a lack of thorough research or knowledge on the part of the claim maker.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a photo that shows Harris placing her hand on a black object, without considering the possibility that the black object is a copy of the Bible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Harris refusing to place her hand on the Bible would be a negative or controversial action, without considering the diversity of religious beliefs and practices in the United States.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the black object Harris rested her hand on is a copy of the Bible, which is supported by a Getty Image photo captured at a different angle."}
