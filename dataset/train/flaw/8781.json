{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows Klansmen and a burning cross at the Democratic National Convention of 1924 contradicts the fact that the photo is actually from a KKK initiation ceremony on a farm near Lake Zurich in 1921.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan by falsely associating the photo with the Democratic National Convention of 1924.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it provides no evidence or reliable sources to back up the assertion that the photo is from the Democratic National Convention of 1924.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between the Ku Klux Klan and the Democratic Party without providing any substantial evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo is from a KKK initiation ceremony on a farm near Lake Zurich in 1921, as stated in the Chicago Tribune article."}
