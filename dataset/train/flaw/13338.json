{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost estimate of Obamacare by stating that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) doubled its estimate from $800 billion to $1.7 trillion. The actual increase in the estimate was 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific sources to back up the statement about the CBO's estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the cost estimate of Obamacare is a negative aspect, without considering the potential savings from spending cuts, new taxes, penalties, and other cost-saving measures included in the law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the cost estimate, such as changes in the time frame or the inclusion of additional factors in the estimate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CBO's estimates had not shifted significantly and that the $1.7 trillion figure was widely misused.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual increase in the cost estimate by stating that it was doubled, when it was actually an 8.6 percent increase."}
