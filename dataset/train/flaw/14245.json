{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Barack Obama began his presidency with an \"apology tour,\" which implies that he extensively apologized for America's actions.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Romney repeated this charge, and it is a common theme for some anti-Obama websites and commentators. However, it does not provide substantial evidence or specific examples to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's speeches and remarks during his early travels were apologies, without considering alternative interpretations or intentions behind his statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Obama often used an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation, suggesting that his remarks were not solely apologetic but also aimed at promoting understanding and collaboration.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict highlights that Obama's statements sometimes included acknowledging past American arrogance or dismissiveness, but they were often followed by emphasizing the faults of other countries as well. This indicates that the claim may falter in presenting a comprehensive view of Obama's remarks.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear whether the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the expert's verdict does not provide a direct refutation of the claim. However, the expert's analysis suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the nature and intent of Obama's speeches."}
