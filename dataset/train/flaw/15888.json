{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that pizza vending machines are currently available for ordering.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that pizza vending machines can be ordered, without providing any evidence or information to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations, stating that pizza vending machines have been piloted in Europe and have been \"coming soon\" to the U.S. since at least 2012, but they remain a rarity as of late 2017. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for the claim, such as limited availability or slow adoption of the machines."}
