{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that flames were seen on the India-China border in June 2020. The video provided does not clearly show flames, and the context surrounding the video suggests it may be misleading.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is evidence of flames on the India-China border in June 2020. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video could potentially have an alternative explanation, such as a natural phenomenon or a different location. The video's original caption suggests it may depict a \"supernatural phenomenon\" in Tibet, rather than flames on the India-China border.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was originally published on Douyin (Chinese version of TikTok) in December 2019, suggesting that it is not recent footage from June 2020.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the video's misleading context and the lack of evidence supporting its claim of flames on the India-China border.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it primarily lacks sufficient support and relies on assumptions rather than exaggerations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing clear evidence and supporting information, as well as in accurately representing the context and origin of the video."}
