{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the severity of the incident by stating that the officers fired pepper balls at the car after the driver mentioned the passenger was pregnant. The video and information provided do not indicate that the officers specifically targeted the car because of the pregnancy claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or additional information to fully support the assertion that the officers fired pepper balls at the car because of the passenger's pregnancy. The video and expert's verdict do not provide clear evidence or statements from the officers involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the officers intentionally fired pepper balls at the car because of the passenger's pregnancy. However, without further investigation or statements from the officers, it is unclear what their motivations or intentions were.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the officers' actions that are not explored in the claim. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the full context and reasoning behind the officers' decision to fire pepper balls.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Denver police's use of force guidelines prohibit firing at a pregnant woman if the officer has prior knowledge of the pregnancy. If the officers were aware of the pregnancy, their actions would be in violation of these guidelines. However, it is unclear from the information provided whether the officers had prior knowledge of the pregnancy."}
