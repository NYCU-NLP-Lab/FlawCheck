{"Understate": "The claim understates the involvement of the federal government in the development and implementation of Common Core. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the federal government has been involved in funding and supporting the program, as well as attempts by U.S. Senate Republicans to kill federal funding for Common Core.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the federal government has no involvement in Common Core. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the involvement of federal officials and the influence of Washington in the pushback against Common Core.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Common Core is completely separate from anything the federal government was doing. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Common Core originated from discussions between private nonprofit groups and state education departments, but it does not rule out the influence or involvement of the federal government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim dismisses the alternative explanation that the federal government has no involvement in Common Core. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the federal government has been involved in funding and attempting to control the program, suggesting an alternative explanation for the pushback against Common Core.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Common Core standards for math and English are part of the program. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Common Core includes national education standards for math and English.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of federal government involvement in Common Core by stating that they do not have their fingerprints on it at all. The expert's verdict provides evidence of federal government funding and attempts to control the program, suggesting some level of involvement.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times as there is no clear evidence provided."}
