{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the photo of Narendra Modi's mother in an auto-rickshaw is photoshopped lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is photoshopped based on the hand supporting her right arm, without considering other possible explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the hand supporting the lady, which could be that it belongs to someone who is not visible in the photo.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing clear evidence or a strong argument to support the assertion that the photo is photoshopped.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph is an old image of Hiraben Modi arriving by an auto-rickshaw to cast her vote in 2014, as confirmed by Alt News.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the alleged photoshopping, as it is based on speculation and lacks substantial proof."}
