{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of young people not in America today because of abortion. The expert's verdict states that abortions account for 23.2 percent of all known pregnancies, which is less than a quarter, rather than the one-third claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct link between abortion and the number of young people in America. It assumes that all pregnancies that end in abortion would have resulted in a young person being born and residing in America.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that one-third of all young people in America are not in America today because of abortion. The expert's verdict provides data showing that abortions account for 23.2 percent of known pregnancies, but it does not provide data on the number of young people not in America today due to abortion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of young people not in America today. It solely attributes it to abortion, without considering other factors that could contribute to the demographic trends mentioned by the expert."}
