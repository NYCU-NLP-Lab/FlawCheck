{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of the wall by stating that illegal traffic dropped 72 percent in El Paso and ultimately 95 percent once the wall was up. The expert's verdict explains that these gains were the result of various border security strategies over two decades, not just the construction of the wall.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by attributing the reduction in illegal traffic solely to the construction of the wall, ignoring the other border security strategies that contributed to the decrease.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the claim that the wall has been \"very effective.\" The expert's verdict mentions that very little new fencing has been built under Trump, and the existing barriers are not concrete or like the prototypes of Trump's wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in illegal traffic is solely due to the construction of the wall, disregarding other factors such as enhanced technology and increased border agents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the reduction in illegal traffic can be attributed to various border security strategies implemented over the past 20-plus years, not just the construction of the wall."}
