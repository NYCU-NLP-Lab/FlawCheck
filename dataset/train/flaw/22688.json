{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the problem by stating that \"61 percent of our bridges are in trouble,\" when the actual figure is 24 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for the statistic of 61 percent. The source of the statistic is not provided, and the campaign did not respond to the request for the source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being \"structurally deficient\" or \"functionally obsolete\" implies that a bridge is in trouble or unsafe, which is not necessarily the case according to the Federal Highway Administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the classification of bridges as \"structurally deficient\" or \"functionally obsolete,\" such as changing design standards or increased traffic volume."}
