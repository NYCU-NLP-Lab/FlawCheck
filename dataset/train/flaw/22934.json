{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of countries that are members of the EU by stating that there are only 28, while the expert's verdict mentions that there are actually 28 member states plus an additional four countries that are part of its single market.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all countries are members of the EU, which is not accurate as there are many countries that are not part of the EU.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the comparison between the EU and the WTO is not particularly helpful because they are different organizations with different functions."}
