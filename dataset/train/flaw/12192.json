{"Lack enough support": "The claim that consumers save an average of $500 per car sold through the franchised dealer model lacks enough support because the association's cited study did not compare dealership sales to online or phone sales conducted by Tesla with Texas customers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the franchise model saves consumers money because it allows them to shop around independently-owned dealerships, where deals and other incentives can drop the car's sticker price. However, this assumption may not be universally true and could be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Tesla has declined to sell its electric vehicles through Texas dealerships, such as the need for smaller showrooms in high foot traffic shopping areas to educate buyers about the company's electric technology."}
