{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert mentions that some studies have linked exposure to certain chemicals in sunscreen with adverse health effects, but these findings do not necessarily apply to levels currently found in most sunscreen products.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the chemicals in sunscreen are directly linked to adverse human health effects, including neurological issues and seizures. However, the expert states that the neurological effects of these ingredients remain poorly understood and understudied.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks associated with the chemicals in sunscreen by only mentioning neurological issues and seizures. The expert mentions that exposure to certain chemicals commonly found in sunscreen has been linked to endocrinological, reproductive, and developmental issues as well.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the adverse health effects mentioned. The expert mentions that absorption of chemicals does not necessarily equate to risk and that further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these chemicals.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug and is monitored and enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The expert mentions that most sunscreen products were approved before the modern standardization of drug regulations.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information. The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or inconsistencies in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "It is difficult to determine if the claim exaggerates without more specific information. The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any exaggerations in the claim."}
