{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama is set to replace the bald eagle as the U.S.'s national animal, when in fact there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided to back up the assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the National Bison Legacy Act designates the bison as America's national mammal, but does not change or replace the bald eagle's status as the national bird.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the designation of the bison as the national mammal automatically means the replacement of the bald eagle as the national animal, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that the bison is being designated as the national mammal alongside the bald eagle, rather than replacing it."}
