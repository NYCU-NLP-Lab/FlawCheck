{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in affordable housing construction by stating it has increased by 80 percent. The expert's analysis suggests that the claim includes both new construction and rehabilitation of existing units, which may contribute to an inflated percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that affordable housing construction has increased by 80 percent. While the expert's analysis mentions data from the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, it does not provide specific numbers or sources to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in affordable housing construction is solely attributed to the actions of the state treasurer. However, the expert's analysis suggests that federal tax credits and rehabilitation projects play a significant role in the construction of affordable housing, indicating that there may be alternative factors contributing to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the increase in affordable housing construction may be due to factors other than the actions of the state treasurer, such as federal tax credits and rehabilitation projects. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the increase is solely attributable to the state treasurer's efforts."}
