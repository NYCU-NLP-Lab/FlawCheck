{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton was a member of Monsanto's board of directors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sitting on the board of Walmart automatically means Clinton also sat on the board of Monsanto, which is not explicitly stated or supported.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of Clinton's tenure on Walmart's board of directors, as it is described as a \"little known chapter\" in her career.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Clinton may have avoided discussing her board membership at Walmart, such as strategic campaign decisions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Clinton's board membership at Walmart is known and has been discussed, albeit not extensively.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential disaffection among supporters due to business ties with Walmart and Monsanto, as it states that politicians risk sowing disaffection \"should they evince any significant business ties\" without providing evidence of such disaffection.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and concise statement about Clinton's alleged membership on Monsanto's board of directors, leading to confusion and lack of clarity."}
