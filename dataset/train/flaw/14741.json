{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) told Boeing that it couldn't build a factory in South Carolina solely because it is a right-to-work state. The reality is more complex, as the NLRB filed a complaint against Boeing for allegedly building the factory in South Carolina to punish the union.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the NLRB's actions were solely motivated by South Carolina being a right-to-work state, without considering other factors such as the alleged intent to punish the union.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the NLRB's motive was solely based on South Carolina's right-to-work status.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the NLRB's actions, such as the alleged intent to punish the union for previous labor disputes.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the NLRB's actions and motivations, as it oversimplifies the situation and ignores key details."}
