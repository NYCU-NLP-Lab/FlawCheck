{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which road construction bids are at their lowest in the modern era. The expert's investigation found that bids were low last year, but there is no confirmation or data to support the claim that they are the lowest in the past 20 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that road construction bids are at their lowest in the modern era. The expert's investigation found that there is no annual record of the overall rise or fall in state construction bids, and the information provided by the Virginia Department of Transportation is not conclusive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low bids for road construction projects are solely due to the ideal time for building roads and the increased competition among contractors. However, there may be other factors at play that contribute to the low bids, such as economic conditions or changes in the construction industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation found that the low bids for road construction projects may be attributed to the construction industry hurting and increased competition among contractors. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the low bids, rather than solely attributing it to the ideal time for building roads.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear definition of the \"modern era\" when it comes to road bids. The expert's investigation found that the governor's definition of the modern era is approximately 20 years, but there is no further clarification or justification for this timeframe.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's investigation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts, but it may contradict the lack of sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that road construction bids are at their lowest in the modern era. The expert's investigation found that there is no confirmation or data to support this claim."}
