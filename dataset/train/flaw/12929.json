{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase. While it is true that he supported a plan that allowed for tuition increases up to 15 percent per year, the claim does not provide evidence of whether tuition actually increased by the maximum amount every year.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of the Legislature in setting tuition rates. It suggests that Charlie Crist had the sole authority to allow tuition increases, but in reality, the Legislature also played a role in determining the base tuition increase each year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year. While it provides information about the 2009 plan and Crist's support for it, it does not provide data or specific examples of tuition increases during his tenure as governor.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year is inherently negative. It does not consider the reasons behind the tuition increases or the potential benefits they may have provided to the education system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tuition increases, such as the need to fund scholarships, retain top professors, and compete with other states. It presents the tuition increases as solely the result of Charlie Crist's actions, without acknowledging other factors at play."}
