{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the pens, stating they cost \"$2,025 per pen\" when in reality they cost just under $15 each.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the cost of the pens. The only mention of the price comes from a flagged Facebook post without any other mentions or corroborating sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the pens actually cost just under $15 each, as confirmed by Pelosi's deputy chief of staff.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of the pens was paid for by taxpayers, without providing any evidence or proof of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that Pelosi delayed sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate in order to wait for her \"gold-plated impeachment pens,\" but there is no evidence or alternative explanation provided to support this claim."}
