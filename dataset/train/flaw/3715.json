{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the effectiveness of hiding marijuana in a hemp field by stating that \"it becomes worthless\" and that \"the THC goes away.\" The expert's verdict suggests that while there may be some reduction in THC levels, it is unlikely to render the marijuana completely worthless.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hiding marijuana in a hemp field is a common or significant concern. The expert's verdict suggests that this assumption is problematic as it states that anyone who tries to hide marijuana inside a hemp field is not a very smart criminal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that hiding marijuana in a hemp field makes it worthless. The expert's verdict provides some supporting information but does not fully address the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may have an alternative explanation. It states that it is imperative to keep pollen-producing male plants away from female plants in marijuana cultivation, which could be a more plausible reason for not hiding marijuana in a hemp field."}
