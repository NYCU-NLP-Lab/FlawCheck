{"Exaggeration": "The claim may be exaggerating the progress made in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic by stating that \"we are rounding the turn\" and \"rounding the corner.\" The data presented in the expert's verdict suggests that significant improvements are not actually being made in the fight against the virus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the number of coronavirus cases is actually climbing once again and is at its highest point since early August.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that significant improvements are being made in the fight against the virus. The data provided in the expert's verdict suggests the opposite.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in seasons and colder weather will not worsen the situation, while epidemiologists express concerns about the potential for increased spread during the winter.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a positive outlook on the situation, suggesting that improvements are being made, while the expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and data that contradict this assertion."}
