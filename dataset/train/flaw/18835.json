{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of arsenic contamination in chicken by stating that 70% of chicken in the market contains cancer-causing arsenic. The FDA has not made such a claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that chicken meat sold in the USA contains arsenic. The FDA has stated that there are no longer any FDA-approved arsenic-containing products for chickens.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of inorganic arsenic in chicken meat is solely due to intentional addition to chicken feed. It fails to consider other potential sources of arsenic contamination.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of arsenic in chicken, such as naturally occurring arsenic in the environment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FDA has stated that the levels of inorganic arsenic found in chickens that consumed the drug were \"very low\" and did not pose a health risk.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the FDA's stance on arsenic in chicken, as the FDA has stated that there are no longer any FDA-approved arsenic-containing products for chickens.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential health risks associated with long-term consumption of inorganic arsenic, as identified by the World Health Organization."}
