{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Rihanna's Instagram message on the company's share value by stating that it caused the value to fall by \"hundreds of millions of dollars in one day.\" The actual drop in share value mentioned in the expert's verdict is $754 million, which is less than \"hundreds of millions.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the direct causation between Rihanna's Instagram message and the drop in share value. The expert's verdict mentions that Snap, Inc. did lose value after Rihanna's statement, but it is impossible to quantify the extent of the loss attributable to her statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drop in share value was solely caused by Rihanna's Instagram message, without considering other factors that could have contributed to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the drop in share value could be attributed to a whole ecosystem of viral social media posts and news articles in response to Rihanna's critical intervention. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the drop in share value, beyond just Rihanna's Instagram message.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the share value drop was not \"hundreds of millions of dollars,\" but rather $754 million.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the extent of the drop in share value.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Rihanna's Instagram message by not providing a specific quantification of the drop in share value that can be attributed to her statements."}
