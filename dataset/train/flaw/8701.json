{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which U.S. foreign assistance is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits. The expert's verdict provides evidence that a significant portion of aid flows through American nonprofits, for-profit companies, and educational institutions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that most U.S. foreign assistance is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits. The expert's verdict provides some data from a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, but it does not fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of U.S. foreign assistance, such as aid given directly to foreign governments. The expert's verdict mentions that only 4 percent of USAID assistance goes directly to foreign governments, suggesting that there are alternative channels for aid distribution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving aid to U.S. companies and nonprofits is the most effective way to distribute foreign assistance. However, this assumption is not supported by the provided evidence. The expert's verdict mentions concerns about corruption and poor design in aid programs, which suggests that the effectiveness of aid distribution methods may vary.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and supported statement. It lacks specific evidence and data to back up the assertion, making it less reliable. The expert's verdict also mentions different perspectives and opinions on the effectiveness and allocation of foreign aid, further highlighting the claim's potential weaknesses."}
