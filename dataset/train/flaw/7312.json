{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money that President Obama supposedly delivered to Brazil for offshore drilling projects. The expert's verdict clarifies that Obama did not deliver any such thing during his visit to Brazil.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the Perry campaign did not provide any evidence to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's visit to Brazil and the Ex-Im Bank's preliminary commitment to a Brazilian oil company are connected and that the money was specifically for offshore drilling projects. The expert's verdict states that Perry wrongly characterized what happened and distorted the truth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Obama's visit to Brazil was intended to encourage economic and political ties between the two countries, and the Ex-Im Bank's commitment was not directly related to offshore drilling projects."}
