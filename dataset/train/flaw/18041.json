{"Lack enough support": "The claim of a fly landing on Amy Coney Barrett's shoulder during the confirmation hearings lacks enough support as there is no evidence or footage to verify its occurrence during the specific time mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image being shared on social media accurately represents a fly landing on Barrett's shoulder during the hearings. However, it is later revealed that the image was posted as a joke by a user who took a photo of a fly on her screen while watching the hearing.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that they watched the footage of the hearing and no fly appears on Barrett's shoulder during the mentioned time. This contradicts the claim that a fly landed on her shoulder during the confirmation hearings.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it amplifies the significance of a fly landing on Barrett's shoulder during the hearings by comparing it to a similar incident during the vice presidential debates.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays the significance of the alleged fly landing on Barrett's shoulder.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a single image shared on social media without sufficient evidence or verification of its authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it was posted as a joke by a user who captured a photo of a fly on her screen while watching the hearing. This suggests that the image may not accurately represent a fly landing on Barrett's shoulder."}
