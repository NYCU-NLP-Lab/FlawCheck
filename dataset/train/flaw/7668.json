{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement that Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013, without providing sufficient evidence or comparing it to other cities in the county.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Chief Fernandez is solely responsible for the homicide rate in Hollywood, without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high homicide rate in Hollywood, such as socio-economic factors or the presence of organized crime, which are not explored in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable data to support the statement, as there is a lack of published statewide data for 2013 and the source of the information is disputed by the police union."}
