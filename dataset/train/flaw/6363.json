{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the statement that mobile phone users can update their voicemail greetings even if they lose WiFi and cellular service.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all mobile phone users have the option and means to access their voicemail accounts from landlines, which may not be the case for all users.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that some cellular service providers allow users to access and update their voicemail by calling their own numbers from working landlines or phones on other wireless networks. This suggests that there are alternative methods to keep the voicemail greetings updated even when mobile phones cannot connect to cellular or internet service.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it implies that all mobile phone users can update their voicemail greetings in the event of a hurricane, which is not necessarily true for all users.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact provided by AT&T Wireless spokesperson, Tova Kline, who stated that if users lose phone service, they won't be able to update their voicemail message.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations and challenges faced by mobile phone users in updating their voicemail greetings during a hurricane, as not all users may have access to alternative methods or means to do so.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the ease and availability of updating voicemail greetings during a hurricane by implying that it can be done without data and as many times as desired, without considering the limitations imposed by loss of cellular and internet service."}
