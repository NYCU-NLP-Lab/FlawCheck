{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it only states that Larry Krasner is the only candidate who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty without providing any evidence or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations to the claim, as other candidates have expressed varying degrees of support for the death penalty in certain circumstances.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not consider the stances of all the candidates running for District Attorney, as some did not respond to requests for clarification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Larry Krasner is the only candidate who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty, without considering the statements or positions of all the candidates.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of candidates who explicitly pledge to never seek the death penalty, as it only focuses on Larry Krasner and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all candidates' positions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that there are other candidates who have explicitly stated their stance on the death penalty, even though they may not completely rule it out in extreme circumstances.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Larry Krasner's uniqueness in explicitly pledging to never seek the death penalty, as other candidates have expressed similar positions or conditions for its use."}
