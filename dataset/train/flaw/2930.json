{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the tax cut by stating that it permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada's businesses, when in reality, the tax cut only affected a specific aspect of the payroll tax.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that permanently exempting businesses from the payroll tax is equivalent to cutting taxes, without considering alternative interpretations or perspectives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that taxes were permanently cut for over 95 percent of Nevada's businesses."}
