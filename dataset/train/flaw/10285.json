{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that NASA rejected Hillary Clinton's childhood dream of becoming an astronaut because they did not accept women astronauts at the time. The Washington Post investigation found no evidence of the correspondence described by Clinton, and NASA could not reproduce it either.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on Hillary Clinton's recollection of events from her childhood, which may be subject to memory inaccuracies or biases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that NASA rejected Hillary Clinton's dream solely because they did not accept women astronauts at the time. This assumption may overlook other potential reasons for rejection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why NASA may have rejected Hillary Clinton's dream, such as the specific qualifications and requirements for astronauts at that time, which included being a military test pilot with a degree in engineering.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that NASA did not have a women's astronaut program in the 1960s. The first American woman to go to space was Sally Ride in 1983.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the progress made by NASA in terms of diversity in its astronaut corps. NASA's spokesperson mentioned that the current astronaut corps reflects the nation's diversity, indicating that efforts have been made to include women and people from various backgrounds."}
