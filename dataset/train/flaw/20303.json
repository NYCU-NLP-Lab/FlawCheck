{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"Kenya spends 43% of its national budget on development.\" This could be an exaggeration if the actual percentage is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement about Kenya's tax revenue collection in 2002 and the current collection by the Kenya Revenue Authority. Without supporting evidence, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between tax revenue collection and development without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption. This assumption may be problematic as there could be other factors influencing development.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in tax revenue collection by the Kenya Revenue Authority. It assumes that the increase is solely due to improved governance under the National Rainbow Coalition, without considering other factors such as changes in tax policies or economic growth."}
