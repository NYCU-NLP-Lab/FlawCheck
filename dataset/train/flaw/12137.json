{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of holding your breath as a test for novel coronavirus and drinking water every 15 minutes as a preventative measure for the illness.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to support the claim, and the expert verdict states that there is \"no method\" to test for COVID-19 except for the actual test.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks scientific evidence or support from reputable sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that holding your breath and drinking water can accurately determine the absence of fibrosis and the prevention of the novel coronavirus, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert verdict provides alternative explanations, such as the lack of time for patients to develop fibrosis in COVID-19 cases and the fact that the virus is not prevented by drinking water."}
