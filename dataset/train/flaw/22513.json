{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the health care reform bill is the largest tax increase in U.S. history without providing enough evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the health care reform bill is the largest tax increase in U.S. history. The expert provides information about specific tax increases in the bill, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all tax increases in U.S. history to compare and support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert presents an alternative explanation by mentioning the argument made by Senator Dick Durbin that the health care reform bill is also the biggest tax cut in history. This alternative explanation challenges the claim made in the original statement."}
