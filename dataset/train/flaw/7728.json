{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Congressman Jeff Denham helped broker the deal for Trump's hotel lacks sufficient evidence. The sources provided by the DCCC do not show Denham's involvement in the deal.", "Problematic assumption": "The ad assumes that Denham's advocacy for redeveloping the Old Post Office building is equivalent to brokering the deal for Trump's hotel. This assumption may be problematic as it does not provide direct evidence of Denham's involvement in the specific deal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Denham's advocacy for redeveloping the Old Post Office building was separate from the selection process of the property's developer. Denham's campaign spokesman stated that he was not involved in the selection process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Denham was not involved in the selection process of the property's developer, as stated by Denham's campaign spokesman and confirmed by a GSA spokeswoman.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Denham's involvement by simply stating that he \"helped broker\" the deal. The evidence provided suggests that Denham advocated for the redevelopment of the building, which may have indirectly contributed to the selection of Trump's development company.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence to support the claim that Denham \"bragged about\" the deal. The sources provided by the DCCC do not mention any statements or actions by Denham regarding the deal.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Denham played a significant role in brokering the deal for Trump's hotel. The lack of direct evidence weakens the claim's credibility."}
