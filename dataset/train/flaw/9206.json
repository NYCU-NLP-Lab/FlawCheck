{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Minneapolis police advised residents to submit to robbers after the city defunded the police department, when in reality, the advice was given before any defunding took place and was later amended.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the timeline of events and the reasons behind the advice given by the Minneapolis police.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific sources to back up the assertion that the advice was given as a result of defunding the police department.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the advice given by the Minneapolis police was directly linked to the defunding of the police department, when in fact, the two are separate issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the advice given by the Minneapolis police was not a result of defunding, but rather a response to rising crime rates and that the city council's decision to replace the police department is still pending voter approval."}
