{"Contradict fact": "The claim falsely attributes the responsibility for the spread of the coronavirus to comedian Sam Hyde, which contradicts the fact that researchers are still working to determine the source of the virus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact and scale of the virus by stating that it has affected approximately 18 million people, while the actual number of confirmed cases at the time was nearly 2,900.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the connection between the comedian and the coronavirus outbreak.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the virus was intentionally caused by a specific individual without any basis or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the widely accepted scientific consensus that the virus was transmitted to humans from an animal source, suggesting an alternative explanation that contradicts the claim."}
