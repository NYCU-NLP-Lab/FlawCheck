{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Eleven states have enacted these pay-to-play reforms\" lacks enough support as it is based on the statement of one individual, William Perry, who provided a report from a law firm as evidence. However, the report itself lists 19 states with pay-to-play guidelines, suggesting that the claim may be an understatement.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of states with pay-to-play reforms, as the expert's verdict mentions that the report provided by William Perry lists 19 states with some sort of pay-to-play guidelines. Therefore, the claim of only 11 states enacting these reforms may be an understatement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that pay-to-play reforms are good public policy without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. It is a problematic assumption as it presents a biased perspective on the issue without considering potential drawbacks or alternative viewpoints.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of pay-to-play laws in the 11 states mentioned. It does not explore whether these laws were effective in reducing corruption or if there were other factors that influenced their implementation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on the statement of one individual, William Perry, who admits that he may have underestimated the total number of states with pay-to-play laws. This inconsistency in the information provided raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim itself. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the debate between Kasim Reed and William Perry on the topic of pay-to-play reforms got \"quite heated,\" suggesting that there may be some exaggeration or emotional bias in the way the issue is presented.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of the claim contradicting any established facts. However, the lack of sufficient support and potential understatement suggest that the claim may not accurately reflect the true number of states with pay-to-play reforms."}
