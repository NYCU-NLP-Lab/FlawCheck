{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Indiana expanded Medicaid under Mike Pence's governorship. The expert's verdict mentions that Indiana reached an agreement with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid under a custom program known as the \"new Healthy Indiana Plan.\" However, the state's health care website rarely mentions the words \"Medicaid\" and \"expansion\" together, instead describing the program as a \"homegrown consumer-driven health care coverage program for low-income adults.\" This suggests that the expansion may have been downplayed or presented in a different way.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the bill to expand Medicaid in North Carolina, called \"Carolina Cares,\" was authored by Republicans but does not have enough support to pass in the GOP-controlled legislature. This implies that there may not be sufficient backing for Medicaid expansion in the state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that Mike Pence's approval of Medicaid expansion in Indiana is directly relevant to the situation in North Carolina. While the expert's verdict mentions that Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, pointed to Pence's approval of Medicaid expansion in Indiana as an example, it does not provide evidence or analysis to support the assumption that the two situations are comparable or that Pence's actions in Indiana should be replicated in North Carolina.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation as the expert's verdict mentions that the Affordable Care Act enabled states to cover more people under Medicaid, but it remains deeply unpopular among Republicans. Some state governments, including North Carolina's, are refusing to expand Medicaid coverage. This suggests that opposition to the Affordable Care Act and ideological differences may be more influential factors in the decision not to expand Medicaid in North Carolina, rather than solely relying on Pence's example in Indiana."}
