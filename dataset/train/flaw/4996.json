This undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government distributed 35,000 crore bulbs based on a misleading screengrab, without considering alternative explanations or verifying the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the news channel made a typo during the broadcast, quoting the incorrect number of bulbs distributed.
