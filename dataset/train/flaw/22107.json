{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Grace Poe is ineligible for public office contradicts the fact that the Philippine Supreme Court ruled she was qualified to run for president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a blurry photo taken from an old news report, which does not provide substantial evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that possession of a US passport automatically disqualifies Grace Poe from holding public office, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, which is that the photo was taken out of context and used misleadingly to falsely suggest that Grace Poe is ineligible for public office.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by stating that it proves Grace Poe is \"not a Filipino citizen\" and therefore ineligible for public office, without providing sufficient evidence to support this extreme claim."}
