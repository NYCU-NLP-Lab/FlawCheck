{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Biden exaggerates the impact of acting one week earlier on the number of COVID-19 deaths. The expert's verdict clarifies that the study does not support Biden's claim of 36,000 fewer deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict points out that Biden did not provide any evidence or examples of him calling for social distancing or a nationwide lockdown by early March. This lack of support weakens the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "Biden assumes that if Trump had acted one week earlier, there would be 36,000 fewer deaths. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the study does not make this specific claim and that Biden falsely attributed it to the study.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts Biden's claim by stating that Biden was still holding campaign rallies with large groups of people in early March, which suggests that he was not advocating for social distancing or strict measures at that time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the number of COVID-19 deaths, such as the actions or lack thereof by other officials and health experts, not just Trump's actions.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Biden made false, misleading, or exaggerated claims during the interview, indicating that his statements may not always be accurate or reliable.", "Understate": "No clear evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
