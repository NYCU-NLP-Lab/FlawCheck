{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of executive orders issued by President Obama, stating that he has issued upwards of 1,000 executive orders, more than any modern president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that President Obama has issued over 1,000 executive orders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of executive orders issued by a president is a measure of their desire to take control away from the House and Senate, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the number of executive orders issued by President Obama, such as the historical context of executive orders and the actions of previous presidents."}
