{"Understate": "The government never committed to taking 3,000 child refugees from Europe under the Dubs Amendment.", "Falters at times": "The government has been accused of accepting thousands fewer child refugees from elsewhere in Europe than it had indicated.", "Lack enough support": "The government never officially said that the number of children resettled under the Dubs Amendment would be 3,000, although there may have been unofficial indications to that effect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government should accept 3,000 child refugees from Europe based on an earlier version of the Dubs Amendment, but the government accepted the amendment after the 3,000 target was taken out of it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The government initially stated that it would resettle 3,000 children and their families, but from the Middle East and North Africa rather than from Europe. The rejection of the 3,000 target for children already in Europe led to the suggestion of relocating unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe without a fixed target."}
