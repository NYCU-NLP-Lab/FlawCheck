{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks official data or a settled count on the number of guns in America, making it difficult to support the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of guns in a country directly correlates with the number of gun deaths, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the higher number of gun deaths in the United States, such as differences in gun control laws, cultural factors, or socioeconomic factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of guns in America due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing concrete evidence or data to support the assertion of \"more gun deaths by far\" in the United States compared to other countries.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States, making it impossible to determine if there are \"more gun deaths by far\" compared to other countries.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the difference in gun deaths between the United States and other countries, as there is no settled data to support this assertion."}
