{"Understate": "The claim may understate the safety ranking of Providence by stating it is the 183rd safest city, without mentioning the total number of cities being compared.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the ranking of Providence as the 183rd safest city.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ranking of cities based on crime rates is the sole indicator of overall safety, without considering other variables such as economic and demographic factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The FBI statement suggests that rankings based solely on reported crime figures may lead to misleading perceptions and do not consider other variables that affect crime rates. This implies that there could be alternative explanations for the safety ranking of Providence."}
