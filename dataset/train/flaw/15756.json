{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the complexity of the opioid crisis by attributing it solely to a decline in federal prosecutions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between the decline in federal prosecutions and the opioid crisis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in federal prosecutions is solely responsible for the worsening of the opioid crisis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts argue that the increase in opioid overdose deaths is primarily driven by factors such as the arrival of fentanyl, overprescription of opioids, and decline in heroin retail prices, rather than the decline in federal prosecutions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that overall drug prosecutions declined, not just prosecutions related to opioids.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of federal prosecutions on the opioid crisis by suggesting that prosecutors \"let it go by\" solely due to the decline in prosecutions."}
