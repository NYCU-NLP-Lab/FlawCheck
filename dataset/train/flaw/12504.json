{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the Copenhagen Accord by stating that it was the \"first agreement ever\" where China and India committed to reducing their emissions. While it was a significant step, it was not the first agreement of its kind.", "Understate": "The claim understates the criticisms and limitations of the Copenhagen Accord. It fails to mention that the accord was non-binding and that countries set their own voluntary targets, leading some to view it as essentially meaningless.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully substantiate the extent of Hillary Clinton's role in negotiating the Copenhagen Accord. It states that she played a key role but does not provide specific details or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Copenhagen Accord broke the \"firewall\" between developed and developing countries when it came to climate action responsibility. This assumption may be debatable and lacks sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for China and India's commitment to reducing emissions, such as their own national climate change programs that were released prior to the Copenhagen Accord."}
