{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that a \"significant quantity\" of supplies were thrown away, but the evidence provided in the video does not give a clear indication of the scale of the discarded items.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Red Cross was instructed to throw away donated supplies. The video and narration provided do not provide concrete proof or additional information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for discarding the supplies was to collect more for Florida, but this is based on the narrator's interpretation of a statement allegedly made by the Red Cross director. There is no direct evidence or confirmation of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Red Cross spokesperson denies that any such order was given and suggests that the video was filmed in a location far from their primary operations. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
