{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Candidate Slotkin is partisan by stating that she voted 96% of the time with Speaker Pelosi. The expert's verdict mentions that the figures cited by both Slotkin and her challenger may not be accurate measures of ideology or bipartisanship.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting with Speaker Pelosi and \"The Squad\" automatically makes Slotkin more liberal and less moderate. The expert's verdict mentions that independent analyses show Slotkin meets other criteria to back her claim of being more moderate than her Democratic colleagues.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Slotkin's voting record makes her very partisan. The expert's verdict mentions that the figures cited by both Slotkin and her challenger are not good measures of ideology or bipartisanship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for Slotkin's voting record, such as meeting other criteria to back her claim of being more moderate than her Democratic colleagues.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Slotkin has told voters she has voted in an independent and bipartisan fashion during her first term in Congress. The expert's verdict mentions that Slotkin has made this claim during her re-election campaign.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in terms of biases."}
