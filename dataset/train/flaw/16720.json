{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Wendy Davis's stance on abortion by stating that she opposes any limits on abortion, without considering any exceptions or circumstances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or backup information to support the assertion that Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Wendy Davis's opposition to the new Pro-Life law in Texas translates to opposing any limits on abortion, which may not be an accurate assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Wendy Davis's campaign spokesman provides an alternative explanation, stating that she opposes late-term abortions except in specific cases, such as when the life or health of the mother is endangered, or in cases of rape, incest, or severe fetal abnormalities."}
