{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the orangutan washing its hands during the COVID-19 pandemic by implying that it is directly related to the crisis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct connection between the orangutan washing its hands and the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the orangutan started washing its hands because it saw zookeepers doing it during the COVID-19 crisis, which may be a problematic assumption without concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the orangutan washing its hands, as the video was filmed before the COVID-19 outbreak and the orangutan's behavior may be unrelated to the pandemic."}
