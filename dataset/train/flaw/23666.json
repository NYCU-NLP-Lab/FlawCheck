{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Ohio's Cedar Point amusement park will not be open for the 2017 season.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rumor circulating on Facebook about Cedar Point not reopening is true, without providing any substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cedar Point did not announce that they wouldn't be reopening in 2017 due to safety concerns, as clarified in a Facebook post by the park.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rumor, such as the possibility of it being a prank or a hoax generated on social media platforms."}
