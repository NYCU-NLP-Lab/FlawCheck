{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Tim Kaine proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the proposed tax increase would have raised about $1.9 billion, which is less than $4 billion.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not provide enough context or evidence to support the statement that Tim Kaine did a \"lousy job\" as governor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the Trump campaign did not respond to the request for backing the claim. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "There may be a problematic assumption in the claim that Tim Kaine's proposed tax increase would have affected people earning as little as $17,000 a year. The expert's verdict mentions that the $17,000 income threshold was used in a different context and proposal made by Kaine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as differing interpretations of Kaine's fiscal record or differing opinions on the effectiveness of proposed tax increases. However, the expert's verdict does not provide specific alternative explanations."}
