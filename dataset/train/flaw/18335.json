{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of the supplement InteliGEN in boosting brain function. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence of clinical trials or testing on the product, and the website does not provide a label with a full list of ingredients.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that InteliGEN can boost brain function without providing substantial evidence or scientific backing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the ingredients listed in the supplement are considered \"possibly safe\" or \"likely safe\" by WebMD, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for any potential effects on brain function.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that one of the ingredients, vinpocetine, is not all-natural but rather a synthetic alkaloid derived from the periwinkle plant. This contradicts the claim's assertion of containing \"all-natural, pure and safe ingredients.\"", "Exaggerate": "The claim uses strong language such as \"boost intelligence\" and \"increase productivity,\" which may be seen as an exaggeration without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "No specific instances of understatement are evident in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing concrete evidence or support for its assertions, as mentioned in the lack of clinical trials, missing ingredient label, and vague website information."}
