{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Bernie Sanders was omitted from the Chicago primary ballot is based on social media rumors and a photo of a \"sample ballot\" that does not list Sanders as a candidate. There is no concrete evidence or official confirmation to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the omission of Sanders from the sample ballot indicates voter suppression or intentional exclusion. However, it is possible that the sample ballot was not meant to be an accurate representation of the actual ballot, and votes for Sanders could still be cast in the primary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Commenters on the social media posts pointed out that votes for Sanders could and had been cast in the primary, suggesting that the claim of omission may not be accurate. This alternative explanation challenges the validity of the claim."}
