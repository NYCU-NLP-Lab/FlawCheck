{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of religious symbols and references in U.S. capital buildings by stating that there are \"Bible verses etched in stone all over the Federal Buildings and Monuments in Washington, D.C.\" This may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that there are religious symbols and references in U.S. capital buildings and the words of America's founders. It only provides general statements and quotes without specific references or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of religious symbols and references in U.S. capital buildings and the words of America's founders indicates a government endorsement of Judeo-Christian tradition. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the principle of separation of church and state in the United States.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that much of the information presented in the claim is inaccurate. This suggests that the claim may contain factual inaccuracies or misrepresentations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by repeating certain statements, such as the description of Moses and the Ten Commandments on the Capitol Building and the Supreme Court doors. This repetition may indicate a lack of additional evidence or examples to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of religious symbols and references in U.S. capital buildings and the words of America's founders. It assumes a specific intent or endorsement without exploring other possible reasons for their inclusion."}
