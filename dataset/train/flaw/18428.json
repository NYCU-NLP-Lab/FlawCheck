{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential damage to groundwater caused by hydraulic fracking, as there are ongoing investigations and limited evidence suggesting that fracking can affect water tables and aquifers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to back up the statement that state agencies have not identified a single instance of groundwater damage due to hydraulic fracking.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that state agencies are the only reliable source of information on groundwater damage caused by hydraulic fracking, without considering alternative sources or studies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that any groundwater damage may be attributed to well construction issues rather than the fracking process itself."}
