{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it compares the percentage of visas set aside for skilled immigrants in Canada (36 percent) to the percentage in the United States (6 percent), implying a significant disparity. However, the claim does not provide any context or evidence to support this comparison, making it an exaggerated statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any data or evidence to back up the percentages mentioned. It is a general statement without specific details or sources, making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of visas set aside for skilled immigrants is the sole factor determining a country's immigration policy. It fails to consider other factors such as family reunification, humanitarian protection, and employment-based immigration, which are important aspects of immigration policies in both Canada and the United States.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that might influence the percentage of visas set aside for skilled immigrants. It presents the comparison between Canada and the United States without exploring the underlying reasons or policies that might contribute to the difference in percentages."}
