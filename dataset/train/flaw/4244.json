{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the $10,000 tax deduction for millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools. The expert's verdict states that the deduction is worth hundreds of dollars to Wisconsin taxpayers, rather than the full $10,000.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential benefits of the tax deduction for millionaires. The expert's verdict mentions that the deduction can result in a state income tax cut of up to roughly $240 for each elementary school student and $600 for each high school student.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to substantiate the assertion that Scott Walker specifically gave the tax deduction to millionaires. The expert's verdict mentions that the deduction is available to any individuals, regardless of income, including millionaires, but it does not provide direct evidence of Walker targeting millionaires with the deduction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explicitly consider alternative explanations for the tax deduction, such as potential benefits for middle-class families or the argument that it allows parents to choose the best educational option for their children."}
