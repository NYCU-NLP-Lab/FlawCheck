{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Georgia has the highest flu activity in the country\" is not supported by sufficient evidence. The article mentions that Georgia had \"low\" flu activity during a specific week and did not report any hospitalizations or deaths due to the flu.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that flu activity is solely determined by the number of people visiting doctors for treatment of flu-like symptoms. However, the article highlights that South Carolina had fewer flu cases but reported more deaths. This suggests that the number of doctor visits may not accurately reflect the severity of flu activity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article implies that the CDC map, which categorizes states' influenza-like illness activity levels, may not provide a complete picture of flu activity. It mentions that the map is based on outpatient visits to doctors and does not consider the number of deaths. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the high flu activity claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the limitations of the data used to determine flu activity levels. It fails to acknowledge the discrepancies between doctor visits and actual flu-related deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Georgia had \"low\" flu activity during the specific week mentioned in the article.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the flu activity in other states by focusing solely on Georgia. The article mentions that the rest of the nation fell within the \"minimal\" range, indicating that there may be other states with higher flu activity.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
