{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the veterans' disability claims backlog doubled during Obama's first term. The expert's verdict provides data showing a 589 percent increase, but also notes that there is a hitch in those numbers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that the veterans' disability claims backlog doubled during Obama's first term. While the expert's verdict provides some data, it also acknowledges that there is a hitch in those numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may be based on a problematic assumption that the increase in the veterans' disability claims backlog is solely attributable to Obama's first term. The expert's verdict mentions that the backlog grew worse due to various reasons, including the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the doubling of the veterans' disability claims backlog. The expert's verdict mentions that the backlog grew worse due to factors such as the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq, suggesting that there are other factors at play besides Obama's first term."}
