{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that a Muslim man was forced to lick a Hindu's spit, which may be an exaggeration of the actual incident shown in the video.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident was motivated by religious differences, specifically to break the Muslim man's Ramadan fast, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that the incident was specifically targeting the Muslim man because of his religious identity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the incident was not motivated by religious differences, as both the perpetrator and the victim hailed from the same community. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assumption."}
