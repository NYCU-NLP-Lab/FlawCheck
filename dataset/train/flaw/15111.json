{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that 28 soldiers were martyred in ceasefire violations by Pakistan on November 13.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viral image of coffins covered with Indian flags is related to the alleged martyrdom of 28 soldiers in ceasefire violations by Pakistan, without providing concrete evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the viral image has been previously published and associated with different events, such as a Maoist attack in Dantewada.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of soldiers martyred by stating it as 28 without providing substantial evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information, as it relies on a viral tweet and an image that has been associated with different events in the past.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the viral image, as it has been previously used in unrelated contexts, suggesting that it may not be directly related to the claimed martyrdom of soldiers."}
