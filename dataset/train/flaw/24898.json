{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it suggests that General Pershing's actions completely eradicated Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to validate the effectiveness of General Pershing's actions in eliminating Radical Islamic Terror for such a prolonged period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that General Pershing's tactics involving pigs' blood were the sole reason for the absence of terrorism for 35 years, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the absence of Radical Islamic Terror during the mentioned period, such as changes in geopolitical dynamics or other counter-terrorism measures, which the claim fails to acknowledge."}
