{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the statement that D.A.R.E. removed cannabis from its list of gateway drugs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that D.A.R.E. had cannabis listed as a gateway drug in the first place, which is not supported by the organization's chief operating officer.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Richard Mahan, the organization's chief operating officer, who stated that D.A.R.E. has never listed so-called \"gateway drugs\" or removed cannabis from any list.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the D.A.R.E. representative, who stated that the page in question does not \"list\" gateway drugs but rather discusses the potential for leading to the use of other drugs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a Reddit post with a dead link as evidence, which weakens its credibility.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of D.A.R.E. removing cannabis from its list of gateway drugs, as it is not clearly established that such a list existed in the first place.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
