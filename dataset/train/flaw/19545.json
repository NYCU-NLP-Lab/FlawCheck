{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video is of Kashmiris protesting against the repeal of Article 370.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is recent and related to the protests against Article 370, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is actually from a protest held by NHM employees in Srinagar in February 2019, not a recent protest against Article 370.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it is not related to the central government's move to repeal Article 370 but rather a protest by NHM employees."}
