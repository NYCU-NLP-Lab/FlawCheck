{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that much of the information presented in the claim is questionable, out of date, or poorly-defined, making it less accurate over time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the existing human ratios would remain the same if the earth's population were to shrink to a village of 100 people, without providing sufficient evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim presents simplified proportions of common traits in the hypothetical village of 100 people, which may not accurately represent the complexity and diversity of the actual world population.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that 6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 would be from the United States, which contradicts the distribution of wealth in the real world.", "Exaggerate": "The claim presents a simplified breakdown of the world population into specific regions and traits, which may oversimplify the actual diversity and complexity of human populations."}
