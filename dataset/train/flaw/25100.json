{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate in Wisconsin, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that supports this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a single study by a left-leaning research organization, and there may be other factors or studies that provide a different perspective on the tax rates of the wealthiest 1 percent in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the tax burden of the wealthiest 1 percent in Wisconsin is lower than other income groups solely based on state and local taxes, without considering other factors or taxes that may affect the overall tax burden.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study omits certain taxes and includes a federal provision that may make the state tax system look more regressive. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the lower tax burden of the wealthiest 1 percent in Wisconsin, which are not fully addressed in the claim."}
