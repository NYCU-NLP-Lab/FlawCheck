{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the distance between Myanmar and China, stating it is only 2 km, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the distance between Myanmar and China is only 2 km.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the distance between two countries is the sole factor determining why Rohingyas would choose to come to India instead of China, without considering other factors such as political or economic conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the existence of alternative explanations for why Rohingyas might choose to come to India rather than China, such as cultural or historical ties, language similarities, or existing Rohingya communities in India.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the total length of the international border between Myanmar and India is 1,643 km, not 1769 km as stated.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexities and nuances of the situation by simplifying it to a single factor (distance) and ignoring other relevant factors."}
