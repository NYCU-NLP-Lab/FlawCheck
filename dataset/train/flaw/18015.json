{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of presidential candidates who pay their interns by stating that Bernie Sanders is one of the few, if not the only one, to do so. The expert's verdict clarifies that there are at least a few exceptions and candidates offering other forms of compensation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Bernie Sanders is the only presidential candidate to pay his interns. The expert's verdict provides evidence of other candidates, such as Ben Carson, offering forms of compensation to their interns.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that paying interns is a significant factor in evaluating presidential candidates. The expert's verdict highlights that offering unpaid internships is not illegal and that tangible benefits can be provided in return.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other candidates may offer internships but the information about their payment status is not available. The expert's verdict mentions that the payment status of Donald Trump's campaign internships is unknown."}
