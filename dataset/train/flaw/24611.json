{"Lack enough support": "The claim that 49 percent of all pregnancies in Oregon in 2010 were unintended is supported by the Oregon Health Authority's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey, which asked new mothers about their intentions to get pregnant. However, the claim could benefit from additional supporting evidence or data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim focuses on unintended pregnancies and their impact on family finances and taxpayer costs, there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to these outcomes that are not addressed.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any established facts or data.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate any information or facts.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any specific points or in its overall presentation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that unintended pregnancies have negative financial implications for families and taxpayers, but it does not provide detailed evidence or analysis to support this assumption."}
