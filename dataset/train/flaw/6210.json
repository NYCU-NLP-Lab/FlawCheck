{"Lack enough support": "The claim that David Perdue supports Common Core is based on a website that has not provided enough evidence or identified its authors, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting Common Core would be problematic for a Republican candidate, without providing any explanation or evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state Republican Party in Georgia initially adopted the Common Core plan in 2010.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing the full context of Perdue's stance on Common Core, as the article mentioned that the website did not include additional information from a Marietta Daily Journal interview with Perdue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that Perdue's stance on Common Core may have evolved or changed since the initial adoption of the plan in Georgia."}
