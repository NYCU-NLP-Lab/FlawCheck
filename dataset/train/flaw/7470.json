{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the fertilizer plant had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006 lacks sufficient evidence to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of inspection is directly related to the explosion, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the year reference of 2006 is incorrect, suggesting that the plant may have been inspected more recently.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that both state and federal agencies were involved in regulating the plant, indicating that there may be alternative explanations for the lack of inspection."}
