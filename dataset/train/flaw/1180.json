{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of dangerous terrorists released, stating \"hundreds and hundreds\" when the actual number is 122.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that releasing terrorists has been a common and foolish practice.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that releasing terrorists is always a mistake without considering potential reasons or circumstances behind such decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that Baghdadi was released by the Iraqis, not directly by the United States, suggesting an alternative explanation for his release."}
