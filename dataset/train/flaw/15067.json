{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA are in cahoots to silence word of the chemical's harmful effects and its high concentration in foods. The expert's verdict provides information on the ongoing debate and regulatory agencies' assessments, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the alleged collusion between Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA. The expert's verdict mentions the ongoing debate and regulatory assessments but does not provide evidence of a deliberate effort to silence information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high levels of glyphosate in American foods are solely due to collusion between Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which highlights the widespread use of glyphosate and its potential runoff into the water supply.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of high levels of glyphosate in American foods, such as the widespread use of glyphosate in agriculture and its potential runoff into the water supply. The expert's verdict provides information on the various factors contributing to glyphosate residue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that glyphosate is widely used and regulated by various agencies. The expert's verdict mentions the assessments conducted by the EPA and the ongoing debate surrounding glyphosate's safety.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
