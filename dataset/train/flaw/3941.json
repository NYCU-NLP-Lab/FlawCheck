{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that quoting the Bible will become illegal in Cincinnati, when in reality, the proposed ban is on reparative or conversion therapy for LGBT youth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ban on reparative therapy is equivalent to making it illegal to quote from the Bible, which is a problematic assumption as the two are unrelated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one article from Cincinnati.com, which does not support the assertion that quoting the Bible will become illegal.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no major city has passed a law making it illegal to quote from the Bible, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the proposed ban on reparative therapy is aimed at protecting LGBT youth and does not directly target quoting the Bible."}
