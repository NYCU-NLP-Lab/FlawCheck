{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that no one under 20 has died of COVID-19, when in fact there have been reported deaths in this age group.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of deaths in people under 20 by claiming it is zero, when there have been documented cases of deaths in this age group.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that no one under 20 has died of COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that it has not been determined whether a young person can spread the disease to an older person, when there is evidence from the CDC that younger people can indeed spread the virus to older age groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that even if the risk of serious illness is lower among young people, they can still spread the virus to older adults who are more susceptible to serious illness and death."}
