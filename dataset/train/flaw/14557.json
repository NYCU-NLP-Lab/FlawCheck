It only mentions concerns expressed by the Epilepsy Foundation and social media posts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the epilepsy warning at movie theaters is directly linked to specific scenes in the film without providing concrete evidence or details about the scenes in question.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the epilepsy warning at movie theaters, such as a general precautionary measure taken by theaters to ensure the safety of all moviegoers, rather than specific scenes in the film."}
