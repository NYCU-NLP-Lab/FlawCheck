{"Understate": "The claim may understate the restrictions placed on brewpubs, as the expert mentions that the law makes it clear that brewpubs can only sell on-site or to wholesale dealers, without the ability to sell their products to go.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific evidence or data provided to back up the statement that brewpubs can't sell growlers of their beer to customers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that brewpubs are not allowed to sell growlers of their own beer, but the expert suggests that hypothetically they could sell a growler of beer that they did not produce on site. This assumption is not clearly supported or explained.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative reasons or factors influencing the restrictions on brewpubs' ability to sell growlers of their beer, such as regulatory concerns or industry competition."}
