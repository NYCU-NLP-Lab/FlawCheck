{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that none of the government programs targeted for elimination or severe cutback appeared on the GAO's list of government programs at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the government programs on the GAO's list means they are not at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. However, this assumption may be problematic as there could be other factors or criteria that the GAO considers when determining the programs at high risk.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the absence of the government programs on the GAO's list, such as the GAO's methodology or criteria not aligning with the specific programs targeted for elimination or cutback."}
