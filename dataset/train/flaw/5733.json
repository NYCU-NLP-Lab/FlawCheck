{"Contradict fact": "The claim that all four presidents on Mount Rushmore were independents at one critical point in their career contradicts the expert's assessment that only George Washington could be considered a true independent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that all four presidents on Mount Rushmore were independents at some point in their careers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being an independent means not being affiliated with any political party, which the expert points out is not entirely accurate for some of the presidents mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations for each president's political affiliations, suggesting that they were not all independents at any point in their careers."}
