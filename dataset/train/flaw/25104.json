{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of the cost that the United States is paying for NATO. The expert's verdict states that the U.S. share of the commonly funded NATO budget is just over 22 percent, not 90 percent as claimed.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Trump's complaints about NATO spending are based on how much the U.S. spends on its own defense compared to other member nations."}
