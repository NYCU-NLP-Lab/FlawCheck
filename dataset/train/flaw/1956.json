{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the job growth in Wisconsin by stating it was the largest and best since the 1990s, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement of having the largest and best private sector job growth in the state since the 1990s.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that job growth in 2013 outpaced gains in every year for nearly the last decade and a half, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing reliable and consistent data by relying on monthly job estimates based on government surveys of a small sample of employers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job growth, such as the impact of national recessions and the state's failure to rebound to pre-recession job levels."}
