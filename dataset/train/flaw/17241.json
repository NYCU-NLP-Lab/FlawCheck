{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that \"no one\" came to the rally, when in fact there was a deliberate effort by the Biden campaign to keep the crowd size limited.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of a large crowd at the event is indicative of Biden's inability to compete on event turnout, without considering the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the campaign's decision to prioritize public health.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Biden and Harris had a rally in Arizona and that no one attended. The event described in the claim was not a rally but a meeting with tribal leaders, as clarified by a local reporter.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the smaller crowd size, such as the intentional decision by the Biden campaign to limit the number of attendees due to COVID-19 concerns.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the nature of the event and presenting it as a rally, when it was actually a different type of gathering.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the event was not a rally, but a meeting with tribal leaders, as confirmed by a local reporter.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim."}
