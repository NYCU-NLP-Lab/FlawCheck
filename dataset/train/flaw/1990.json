{"Exaggerate": "The claim of being able to put 10,000 people to work through retrofitting state buildings for energy independence or efficiency may be seen as an exaggeration, especially considering the current economic conditions and the state's unemployment rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to validate the assertion that 10,000 jobs can be created through retrofitting state buildings. The evidence provided includes estimates from two separate reports, but it is unclear if these estimates are enough to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that retrofitting state buildings for energy independence or efficiency will directly result in the creation of 10,000 jobs. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other factors that could affect job creation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim attributes job creation solely to retrofitting state buildings, there may be alternative explanations for job creation in the energy sector or other industries that are not considered in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the challenges and financial implications of retrofitting state buildings. The expert's verdict mentions the significant investment required (around $500 million) to achieve the goal of putting 10,000 people to work, which suggests that the claim may not fully acknowledge the magnitude of the task."}
