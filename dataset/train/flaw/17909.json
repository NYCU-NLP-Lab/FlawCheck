{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of support for universal background checks by stating that \"90% of Americans do not support\" them, when in fact, many polls show support at or near 90%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or references to back up the assertion that only 10% of Americans support universal background checks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by California House Representative Mike Thompson about 90% support for universal background checks is false, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discrepancy in support for universal background checks, such as the potential impact of a national gun registry requirement on the level of support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that multiple polls conducted in 2019 and even more recently have shown support for universal background checks at or near 90%.", "Understate": "The claim understates the level of support for universal background checks by suggesting that only 10% of Americans support them, when in reality, polls consistently show higher levels of support ranging from 83% to 93%.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information, such as the Facebook post questioning the popularity of universal background checks without providing a balanced view of the overall support indicated by various polls."}
