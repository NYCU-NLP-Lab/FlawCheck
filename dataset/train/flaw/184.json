{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that an Australian military veteran single-handedly beat up eight Muslim men who attacked his wife. The expert's verdict mentions that it is unclear how many people were involved in the altercation and there are no follow-ups detailing the outcome of the investigation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals involved in the altercation were Muslim, even though it is not clear how anybody could determine their religion just by looking at them.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of attackers involved, stating that there were eight men, while local news reports mention that Tyrrell sent one person to the hospital with injuries.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and details of the incident by simplifying it to a single act of a veteran beating up attackers, without considering factors such as the cause of the altercation or the outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the incident may have started over a disagreement about the legality of catching crabs, indicating that there could be alternative explanations for the altercation rather than it being solely motivated by religion or culture.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are inconsistencies and lack of evidence in the accounts provided by the Tyrrells, indicating that the claim may falter in its accuracy and reliability.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident has become an anti-Muslim rallying cry on social media and white supremacist websites, even though there is no evidence that Tyrrell himself made any anti-Muslim statements or that the incident was solely motivated by religion."}
