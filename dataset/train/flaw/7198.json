{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Gov. Mitch Daniels exaggerates the future spending on interest payments compared to national security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the budget analysis shows that interest payments will not exceed security spending in any given year.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as different definitions and budget proposals are used to analyze the comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that interest payments will soon cost more than national security, which is not supported by the budget analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations and definitions that could make the math add up, such as limiting \"national security\" spending to the Department of Defense budget. However, these alternative explanations are not consistent with the claim made by Gov. Mitch Daniels."}
