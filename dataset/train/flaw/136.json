{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Steve Bullock steered $14.3 million to his brother's company. The company's CEO and a spokesperson for Montana's Department of Administration both stated that the governor had no involvement in state contracts awarded to the company.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the contracts financially benefited William Bullock, the governor's brother, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption. The CEO of the company disputes this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that William Bullock sold his shares in Pioneer Technical Services four years before his brother became governor.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of evidence and support for the accusation against Gov. Steve Bullock. The expert's verdict highlights the unsubstantiated nature of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the contracts awarded to the company, as the company's CEO stated that they have consistently been selected for state work in Montana since 1992. This implies that the contracts may not be a result of nepotism or favoritism towards the governor's brother."}
