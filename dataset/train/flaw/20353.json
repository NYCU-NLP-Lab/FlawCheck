{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times George Holding has voted to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. The expert's verdict states that Holding has voted 14 times on bills that affect pre-existing conditions, but not all of these bills would have denied protection for people with pre-existing conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that George Holding has specifically voted 13 times to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. The expert's verdict mentions that Holding has voted 14 times on bills related to pre-existing conditions, but the claim does not provide specific details or sources to support the number 13.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of George Holding's votes on bills related to pre-existing conditions were aimed at denying coverage. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that not all of the bills voted on by Holding would have denied protection for people with pre-existing conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for George Holding's votes on bills related to pre-existing conditions. The expert's verdict mentions that some of the bills voted on by Holding were budget bills that defunded Obamacare, which may not necessarily imply a direct intention to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) bans insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The expert's verdict mentions that the ACA has provisions to protect people with pre-existing conditions, which suggests that the claim's assertion of Holding voting to deny coverage may be contradictory to the existing law.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the potential impact of Holding's votes on bills related to pre-existing conditions. While the claim focuses on the number of votes, the expert's verdict mentions that some of the bills voted on by Holding were full repeals of Obamacare, which could have had significant consequences for pre-existing condition protections.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of all the bills voted on by George Holding related to pre-existing conditions. The expert's verdict mentions that Holding has voted on various bills, but the claim only focuses on a specific number of votes without considering the nuances of each bill."}
