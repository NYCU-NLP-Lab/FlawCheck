{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of Chinese fishing vessels in Philippine waters by stating \"lots and lots\" of boats are fishing inside the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Chinese fishing boats are present in Philippine waters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Chinese fishing boats in Philippine waters is a result of the current president's actions, without providing any direct evidence or connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of Chinese fishing boats, such as historical or geopolitical factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo used as evidence is from 2012, four years before the current president took office. This contradicts the claim's implication that the president is responsible for the presence of Chinese fishing boats.", "Understate": "The claim understates the context of the current president's pursuit of warmer ties with China and his efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, which may have influenced the presence of Chinese fishing boats.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and up-to-date information, as it uses a photo from 2012 to support its assertion about current Chinese fishing activities."}
