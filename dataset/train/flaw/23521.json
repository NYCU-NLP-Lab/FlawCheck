{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the length of time that China should have informed the US about the coronavirus, stating that it should have been three months sooner, when in fact the virus was not known until December and China alerted the World Health Organization on December 31st.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that China knew about the virus and deliberately withheld information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that China intentionally concealed information about the virus, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as it is suggested that President Trump's statement does not align with the facts and that China did make the sequence of the virus public by January 10th.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the US government was aware of the virus by early January, at the latest, which undermines the assertion that China should have informed the US three months earlier.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making imprecise and misleading statements, as noted by the expert's verdict, which may indicate bias in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
