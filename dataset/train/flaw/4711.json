{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Richard Nixon released his tax returns when he was under audit. Nixon did release his tax returns, but it was after he was re-elected and faced questions about his tax filings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that Nixon released his tax returns when he was under audit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nixon releasing his tax returns while under audit sets a standard for presidential candidates to do the same. However, this assumption is problematic as it ignores the fact that Nixon's release of tax returns was prompted by the Watergate scandal and questions about his tax filings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Nixon released his tax returns while under audit, such as the need to address persistent questions and concerns about his returns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nixon did not release his tax returns while running for president, as stated by the expert's verdict."}
