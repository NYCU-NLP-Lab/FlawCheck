{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Anderson Cooper was faking the depths of Hurricane Florence floodwaters, when in fact the photographs were from a different hurricane ten years earlier.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the assertion that Anderson Cooper was faking the depths of the floodwaters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photographs in question were not related to Hurricane Florence but were from Hurricane Ike.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Anderson Cooper intentionally misrepresented the floodwaters for dramatic effect, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photographs, stating that Cooper was showing the variations of depths in the water and choosing a visually dramatic spot to report from, but not misrepresenting the general state of the flood."}
