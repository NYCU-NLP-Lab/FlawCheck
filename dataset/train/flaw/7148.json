{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that unemployment has not increased under BJP rule. The only evidence provided is a video clip of a student saying so, without any further context or data to back it up.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the student's response. Initially, the student denies that unemployment has increased, but later changes his answer when it is translated for him.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the student's response represents the overall reality of unemployment under BJP rule, without considering other factors or data that may indicate otherwise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the student's response, which is that he did not understand the question initially and changed his answer when it was translated for him. This suggests that the student's response may not accurately reflect his actual belief or knowledge on the subject."}
