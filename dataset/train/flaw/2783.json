{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of unemployed veterans in America. The expert's verdict provides data showing that the number of unemployed veterans has dropped to 806,000, which is lower than the claimed number of close to 900,000.", "Lack enough support": "While the expert's verdict provides data on the number of unemployed veterans, it does not provide specific sources or references for the claim. It would be helpful to have more information on the sources used to determine the number of unemployed veterans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that changes to labor laws would hit veterans hard and contribute to their struggle to find work. However, this assumption is not directly supported by the evidence provided in the expert's verdict. It would be important to examine the specific labor laws and their impact on veterans' employment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the number of unemployed veterans. The expert's verdict mentions that veterans are faring better than U.S. workers as a whole, indicating that there may be other factors contributing to the unemployment rate among veterans.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of accuracy and timeliness. The expert's verdict mentions that the speech was made in December, and the latest available data at that time showed 832,000 unemployed veterans. Therefore, the claim stating that there are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans \"right now\" may not be entirely accurate or up to date."}
