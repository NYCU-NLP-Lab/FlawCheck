{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which President Obama himself has granted waivers allowing refugees who provided material support to terrorists into the United States. The expert's verdict states that waivers have been granted for about a decade and that the decision is not solely the president's call.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that President Obama himself has granted waivers allowing refugees who provided material support to terrorists into the United States. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no backup provided by Governor Abbott.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that granting waivers to refugees who provided material support to terrorists is a significant threat to national security. The expert's verdict mentions that \"material support\" is not always as threatening as it might sound and that the cited report states that the recently admitted terrorists only participated in these activities \"while under duress.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the granting of waivers to refugees who provided material support to terrorists. The expert's verdict mentions that the waivers were not solely the president's call and that they were granted in consultation with the U.S. secretary of state and attorney general."}
