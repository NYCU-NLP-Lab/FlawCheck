{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of state employees who did not receive a pay raise from 2009 to 2012. The expert's verdict mentions that there were targeted raises for certain employees with law enforcement or prison jobs, which suggests that not all state employees received raises during that period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as there is no central repository of pay-raise data for higher education, so the expert did not delve into that aspect of government for this article.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation as the expert's verdict mentions that employees received $800 bonuses from the 2009 Legislature, which can be seen as a form of compensation or pay increase.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of pay raises for state employees by not considering targeted raises for certain employees with law enforcement or prison jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by stating that \"most\" state employees did not receive any pay raise, without providing specific data or evidence to support this claim."}
