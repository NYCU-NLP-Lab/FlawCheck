{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible source provided to verify that Werner Herzog made the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Werner Herzog made the statement without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The existence of the Werner Twertzog Twitter account and the creator's statement that it is a semi-eponymous short-form genre called 'Twertzog' suggests an alternative explanation for the quote, indicating that it may not have come from Werner Herzog himself.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a Facebook post and a Twitter account that may not be reliable sources of information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Werner Herzog has stated in interviews that he is not on social media and that any accounts bearing his name are impostors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the fact that the quote attributed to Werner Herzog is false, as it was flagged by Facebook for false news and misinformation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
