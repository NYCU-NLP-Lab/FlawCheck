{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no official research or study published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to support the claim made by ABP News.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases would have reached 8.2 lakh if the lockdown was not imposed, without providing substantial evidence or data to back up this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the ICMR did not publish any study regarding the number of cases reaching 8.2 lakh if the lockdown was not imposed. The numbers mentioned are based on a statistical understanding of ICMR data, as stated by Lav Agarwal, the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the potential impact of the lockdown on reducing the number of COVID-19 cases in India. It suggests that without the lockdown, the number of cases would have surpassed those in China and Italy, indicating a potentially severe situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on conflicting statements from different sources, including ABP News, the Ministry of Health, and the Indian Express. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reduction in the number of cases, such as other preventive measures, public awareness campaigns, and healthcare interventions, which are not considered or mentioned in the claim."}
