{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the danger of potassium chloride in vaccines by comparing it to the use of the chemical in lethal injections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the inclusion of midazolam or vecuronium bromide, two lethal injection ingredients, in vaccines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of certain additives or salts in trace amounts in vaccines automatically makes them dangerous, without considering the rigorous safety monitoring of vaccine ingredients.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of potassium chloride in vaccines, such as its use as a salt to maintain cell viability during vaccine production.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that midazolam or vecuronium bromide have no purpose being included in vaccines and are not used in vaccine production.", "Understate": "The claim understates the negligible amount of potassium chloride found in vaccines, comparing it to a pinch of salt.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using an image that falsely implies that potassium chloride is a dangerous vaccine ingredient, while it is actually a necessary component."}
