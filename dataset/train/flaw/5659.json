{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the cost difference between keeping a child in school and keeping someone in prison. The actual cost of keeping someone in prison is stated to be around $30,000 a year, which is higher than the claimed $10,000 a year for keeping a child in school.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the stated cost figures for keeping a child in school and keeping someone in prison. The source provided does not directly provide the specific cost of keeping a child in school.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of keeping a child in school is significantly lower than the cost of keeping someone in prison. However, without more specific data and context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative factors or considerations that contribute to the cost difference between keeping a child in school and keeping someone in prison. The claim does not provide information on other factors that may affect the costs, such as the type of education being provided or the specific needs of the individuals in prison."}
