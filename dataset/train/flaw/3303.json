{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the issue by stating that New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization of people with developmental disabilities in America. It implies that the problem is severe and widespread, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization. The source cited by the governor's spokesperson is from 2008, and more recent figures are acknowledged to be available. Without up-to-date data, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rate of institutionalization is a measure of the quality of care provided to individuals with developmental disabilities. It implies that a higher rate of institutionalization is inherently shameful and in need of change, without considering alternative approaches to care or the specific needs of individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher rate of institutionalization in New Jersey compared to other states. It does not explore factors such as population size, availability of community-based services, or other state-specific policies and practices that may contribute to the observed rate."}
