{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in African-American poll numbers, stating that they doubled from 11 to 22 in one week.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual results of the poll, as it only showed an increase in support among African-American men, not African-Americans in general.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single poll with a small sample size, making it prone to error.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in support among African-American men is solely due to Kanye West's praise, without considering other factors that may have influenced the results.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential range of Trump's approval rating among black men, as the small sample size and high margin of error make it difficult to determine the exact percentage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in support among African-American men, such as changes in policy or messaging that may have resonated with this particular demographic.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the poll results and the factors that may have influenced the increase in African-American support."}
