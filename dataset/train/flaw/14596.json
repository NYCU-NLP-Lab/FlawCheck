{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by PolitiFact, stating that \"95 percent of what (Donald Trump) says is a lie\" when PolitiFact's findings show that only 5 percent of the statements they examined earned a True rating.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that PolitiFact's ratings on Trump's statements can be generalized to conclude that 95 percent of what he says is a lie, without considering the specific context and statements that were evaluated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that 95 percent of what Donald Trump says is a lie, as it only refers to a single statement made by a co-host on The View without providing any additional sources or data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting or misusing PolitiFact's ratings and not accurately representing their findings on Trump's statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the possibility that there may be alternative explanations for the discrepancies between PolitiFact's ratings and the claim made on The View, such as differences in the statements evaluated or differing interpretations of what constitutes a lie."}
