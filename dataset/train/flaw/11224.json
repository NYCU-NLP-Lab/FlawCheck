{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Gov. Scott Walker's public-school budgets by stating that a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in his or her education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school. This may overstate the long-term effects of the budget cuts.", "Understate": "The claim may also be seen as understating the impact of the proposed increase in school aids by Gov. Scott Walker. The expert's verdict suggests that the proposed increase is not enough for schools to make ends meet, indicating that the claim may downplay the severity of the funding situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in education until high school graduation. The expert's verdict provides some context and calculations, but it does not fully support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state investment in education for a student entering kindergarten has been consistently decreasing under Gov. Scott Walker's budgets. However, the expert's verdict mentions that equalized aid to schools had already been reduced before Walker took office, indicating that the claim may not fully consider the previous budgetary decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funding cuts or the proposed increase in school aids. It solely attributes the disparity in state investment to Gov. Scott Walker's budgets, without exploring other factors or external circumstances that may have influenced the funding decisions."}
