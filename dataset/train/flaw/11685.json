{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that protests could permanently halt the Dakota Access Pipeline.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that blocking construction until 1 January 2017 would result in the project's contracts expiring and the pipeline being permanently halted, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the protests on the pipeline project by suggesting that it could be permanently halted, when the actual consequences may be more nuanced.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the future of the pipeline beyond the stated deadline."}
