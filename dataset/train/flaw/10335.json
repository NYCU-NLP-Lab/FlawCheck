{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the gas attacks by stating that it shows child victims of a gas attack in Zambia, when in fact the video shows the aftermath of a stampede in Kenya.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not related to gas attacks in Zambia, but rather a stampede in Kenya.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the video is related to gas attacks in Zambia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is evidence of gas attacks in Zambia without providing any substantial proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the stampede incident in Kenya, which is the actual context of the footage."}
