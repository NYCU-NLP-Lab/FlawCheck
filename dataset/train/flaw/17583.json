{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the audio during the press conference is not clear, and different transcripts provide conflicting information about what Trump actually said.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump referred to white nationalist marchers as \"us\" during the press conference, based on initial observations and a transcript that was later corrected due to the lack of clear audio.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the audio cut out or was indiscernible at the moment Trump referred to the \"alt-left,\" making it difficult to definitively determine his exact words."}
