{"Lack enough support": "The sources provided by the presidency for the claim are limited to provinces or smaller regions, which may not provide a comprehensive representation of the entire country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of women experiencing violence at the hands of their partners is as high as 51%, without considering potential variations or changes over time.", "Understate": "The most recent data shows just over a quarter of South African women report domestic abuse, which is lower than the claimed percentage of 51%.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of accuracy due to limited data collection on the topic of intimate partner violence in South Africa.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the most recent data, which indicates a lower prevalence of domestic abuse among South African women.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of violence experienced by South African women by stating that 51% have experienced abuse at the hands of their partners, without sufficient evidence to support this high percentage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high femicide rate in South Africa, such as factors other than intimate partner violence contributing to the murders of women."}
