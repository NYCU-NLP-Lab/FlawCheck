{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the nativity scene was removed by the Obamas, when in fact it has been displayed every Christmas since the 1960s.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the Obamas removed the nativity scene.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the nativity scene was only brought back to the White House thanks to First Lady Melania Trump, without considering other possible reasons for its continued display.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the nativity scene's presence in the White House, such as the long-standing tradition of displaying it every Christmas."}
