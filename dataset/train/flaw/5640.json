{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Nancy Pelosi's statement by stating that she wants the federal government to establish \"guaranteed minimum incomes\" for \"illegal aliens\" in the next economic relief bill. The expert's verdict clarifies that Pelosi did not definitively state this, but rather suggested considering the option of \"guaranteed incomes\" to help foreign-born individuals without Social Security numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pelosi's mention of \"guaranteed incomes\" refers to implementing universal basic income, while the expert's verdict states that Pelosi used the phrase to mean guaranteeing paychecks for workers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Pelosi specifically wants to establish \"guaranteed minimum incomes\" for \"illegal aliens\" in the next economic relief bill.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pelosi did not definitively state her intention to establish \"guaranteed minimum incomes\" for \"illegal aliens,\" as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Pelosi's mention of \"guaranteed incomes,\" stating that it was in the context of aiding foreign-born individuals without legal status during the COVID-19 economic crisis.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting Pelosi's statement and intentions, as clarified by the expert's verdict."}
