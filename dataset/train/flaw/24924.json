{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the ban on audible clapping by suggesting that it applies only to events organized by the student union, rather than all events at the University of Manchester.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully explaining the reasons behind the ban on audible clapping and the potential impact it can have on students with autism, sensory issues, and deafness.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that audible clapping can trigger issues for certain students or discourage their attendance at events.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may contain a problematic assumption by suggesting that the ban on audible clapping is necessary for inclusivity without considering alternative ways to accommodate different needs and preferences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the ban on audible clapping, such as other measures that could be taken to make events more accessible without completely replacing clapping with British Sign Language."}
