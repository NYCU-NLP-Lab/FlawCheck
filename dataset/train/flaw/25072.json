{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that a \"keto\" diet pill was successfully presented on the television show \"Shark Tank,\" when in fact, no keto-based product has ever been pitched or funded on the show.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or proof provided to support the assertion that a keto diet pill was successfully presented on \"Shark Tank.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because a product named \"PureFit KETO\" was marketed as if it had been successfully pitched on \"Shark Tank,\" all keto pills advertised with \"Shark Tank\" claims are legitimate. However, this assumption is problematic as the \"PureFit KETO\" claim was found to be false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the existence of \"Shark Tank\" claims, such as the use of dubious marketing practices and fake celebrity endorsements to sell supplements."}
