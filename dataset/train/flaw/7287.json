{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money hidden in the Obamacare legislation. While the expert's verdict confirms that there was funding allocated in the legislation, the claim's emphasis on the secrecy and the use of the term \"hidden\" can be seen as an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the money was hidden secretly. The expert's verdict mentions that they contacted Bachmann's office for the source of the number but did not receive a response. This lack of concrete evidence weakens the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money allocated in the Obamacare legislation was hidden from members of Congress. However, the expert's verdict explains that the legislation included appropriations and transfers from other sources, indicating that some funding was already included when it passed. The claim's assumption of secrecy is therefore problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the funding allocated in the Obamacare legislation was not hidden, but rather included in the bill. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of secrecy."}
