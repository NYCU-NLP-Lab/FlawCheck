{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates what CNN reporter Brooke Baldwin actually said. The claim states that she said, \"Don't hire veterans, they can't be trusted with authority,\" while in reality, she made a more nuanced statement about some veterans potentially not being suitable for certain roles due to their lack of familiarity with communities after returning from war.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Brooke Baldwin's statement about some veterans not being ideal police officers implies that veterans, in general, cannot be trusted with authority. This assumption is problematic as it oversimplifies her actual statement and ignores the context in which it was made.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that Brooke Baldwin made the statement attributed to her. The expert's verdict provides a detailed explanation of what she actually said and how it was misinterpreted.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misquoting Brooke Baldwin and misrepresenting her actual statement. This misrepresentation can lead to a distorted understanding of her views and intentions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Brooke Baldwin did not say, \"Don't hire veterans, they can't be trusted with authority.\" The expert's verdict clearly states that the quote attributed to her is a loose paraphrase and not an accurate representation of her words.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Brooke Baldwin's statement, such as the possibility that she was highlighting the need for specific training and support for veterans transitioning into law enforcement roles. This alternative explanation provides a more nuanced perspective that is absent from the claim."}
