{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that Sean Hannity accidentally vaped live on air. It only mentions that a video started circulating on social media, but does not provide any concrete proof or confirmation of the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the video circulating on social media actually shows Sean Hannity vaping live on air. However, it does not provide any verification or confirmation of the video's authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions a previous video from 2017 that supposedly showed Hannity smoking an e-cigarette. This alternative explanation suggests that the current video may not be a genuine incident, but rather a similar viral video that is unrelated to a live on-air mistake.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict includes information about another Fox News host, Greg Gutfeld, who made a gaffe on live television. While this is not directly related to Sean Hannity's alleged vaping incident, it may imply that mistakes or gaffes are common among Fox News hosts.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not appear to exaggerate any aspects of the claim. It provides a factual account of the video circulating on social media and mentions previous instances of similar videos involving Hannity.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not seem to understate any aspects of the claim. It presents the information available without downplaying or minimizing any details.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not contradict any facts presented in the claim. It provides additional information and context surrounding the alleged incident but does not dispute its occurrence."}
