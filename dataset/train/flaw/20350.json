{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that COVID-19 is a lower risk than seasonal influenza for school kids. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is the same or lower than the influenza mortality rate for children and young adults.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the risks faced by children if infected with COVID-19. The expert's verdict mentions that children can develop complications that require hospitalization, and infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of considering all the factors and risks associated with COVID-19 for school kids. The expert's verdict highlights the importance of considering the prevalence of COVID-19 in an area and the potential increase in hospitalization rates when schools reopen.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that COVID-19 is lower risk than seasonal influenza for school kids. The expert's verdict provides some data on mortality rates and hospitalization rates but also mentions the lack of widespread testing and the unknown true incidence of COVID-19 in children.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that the risk to school kids from COVID-19 is solely based on mortality rates. The expert's verdict emphasizes the potential for complications and hospitalization, which should be considered in assessing the risk.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not seem to have an alternative explanation bias, as it does not provide an alternative explanation for the lower risk of COVID-19 compared to seasonal influenza for school kids. The expert's verdict also does not present an alternative explanation but rather provides additional context and information."}
