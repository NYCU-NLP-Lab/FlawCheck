{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they could not find a verbatim quote of Schwarzenegger saying the claim. There is no indication in the story of when or where Schwarzenegger purportedly made the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Schwarzenegger said he would be a better president than Trump and that people should wait for him in 2020. However, there is no evidence or support provided for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Schwarzenegger is ineligible for the U.S. presidency since he is not a natural-born U.S. citizen. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the claim's validity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Schwarzenegger is not eligible to run for the U.S. presidency due to his citizenship status.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the lack of evidence and support for Schwarzenegger's statement, as well as the alternative explanation regarding his eligibility for the presidency."}
