{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of immunity that children have against COVID-19 by stating that they are \"almost immune\" from the disease, which is contradicted by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of COVID-19 on children by suggesting that they are not significantly affected by the disease, whereas the expert's verdict provides evidence that children can catch COVID-19 and be infected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the statement that children are \"almost immune\" from the disease, as it is contradicted by expert opinions and data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that children have stronger immune systems than adults, without providing sufficient evidence or scientific basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations to the claim, such as the fact that children were not exposed to the virus as much as adults due to school closures, and research from other countries showing that children can catch COVID-19."}
