{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the implication that voting by mail would be unsafe based on the United States Postal Service's advice against sending cash in the mail. The claim assumes that the same level of risk applies to both situations without providing sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that the United States Postal Service implies that voting by mail would be unsafe. It only mentions the advice against sending cash in the mail without further context or statements from the USPS regarding mail-in voting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the advice against sending cash in the mail automatically extends to the safety of voting by mail. It does not consider alternative factors or explanations that may differentiate the two scenarios.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the USPS advice against sending cash in the mail, such as the potential for theft or loss during transit. It assumes that the advice is solely based on safety concerns."}
