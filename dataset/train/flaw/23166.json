{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the deepest hole on Earth was sealed after finding a fossil that is 2 billion years old. The expert's verdict clarifies that the termination of the Kola Superdeep Borehole project had nothing to do with fossils but was due to drilling difficulties caused by extreme heat.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Kola Superdeep Borehole is the deepest artificially created hole on Earth, not the one mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement about finding a 2 billion-year-old fossil.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the sealing of the deepest hole on Earth is directly linked to the discovery of a 2 billion-year-old fossil. The expert's verdict clarifies that there is no connection between the fossils and the sealing of the Kola Superdeep Borehole.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the termination of the Kola Superdeep Borehole project, stating that it was due to drilling difficulties caused by extreme heat, not the discovery of fossils.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting misleading images in the advertisement that are unrelated to the Kola Superdeep Borehole and using them to support the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim and expert's verdict."}
