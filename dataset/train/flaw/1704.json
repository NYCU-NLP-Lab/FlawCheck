{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the extent of Cranston's pension problem by stating that the budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs, without acknowledging the significant shortfall in funding for the old police and fire pension programs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the budget funds 100 percent of the retiree benefit costs, especially considering the mentioned shortfalls in funding for the old pension programs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that funding the state-mandated MERS requirement equates to fully funding the retiree benefit costs, without acknowledging the additional funding needed for the old pension programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the budget funding, such as the possibility that the city is on a payment plan to address the pension shortfall gradually rather than fully funding it immediately.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the old police and fire pension programs are significantly underfunded, with only 18.3 percent and 24.1 percent funding levels respectively, according to the city's actuarial report.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive overview of Cranston's pension situation, as it only focuses on the funding of certain pension plans while neglecting the significant shortfalls in the old pension programs.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the budget funds the retiree benefit costs by stating 100 percent funding without acknowledging the substantial funding gaps in the old pension programs."}
