{"Understate": "The claim may understate the ranking of Florida in terms of access to free prekindergarten. The claim states that Florida ranks first in the nation, but the expert's verdict mentions that Florida ranked No. 1 for serving 4-year-olds with 79 percent of the eligible population served in 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify the ranking of Florida in terms of access to free prekindergarten. The expert's verdict mentions that the rankings for Florida were compared against programs in 40 states during the 2011-12 school year, but the next report is expected in April.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ranking first in access to free prekindergarten is a positive indicator of the quality of the program. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Florida only meets three out of ten quality benchmarks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for Florida ranking first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten. The expert's verdict mentions factors such as participation growth and optional program status, but does not explore other potential factors."}
