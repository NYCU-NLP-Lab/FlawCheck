{"Understates": "The claim made by the governor of Cross River state that crimes in the state represent only 1.1% of the total crime in Nigeria is understated. The best statistics available from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that 1.61% of all crimes in the country are in Cross River state.", "Lack enough support": "The governor's claim lacks enough support from the available statistics. The National Bureau of Statistics data does not support the claim of Cross River state being the safest in the country, as at least 20 other states have fewer instances of crime.", "Problematic assumption": "The governor's claim assumes that the reported crime statistics accurately represent the actual crime rate in the state. However, the director of household statistics at the National Bureau of Statistics mentioned that there could be unreported crimes, indicating a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim made by the governor does not consider alternative explanations for the low reported crime rate in Cross River state. Dr Ona Ekhomu, president of the Association of Industrial Security and Safety Operators of Nigeria, highlighted the fear of victimization by the police and the difficulty in reporting crimes in Nigeria, which could contribute to underreporting of crime incidents.", "Contradict fact": "The governor's claim contradicts the fact that Cross River state is not the safest in Nigeria, as there are at least 20 other states with fewer instances of crime.", "Falters at times": "The governor's claim falters at times as he himself bemoaned the state's security challenges a month after making the claim, indicating a lack of consistency in the state's safety.", "Exaggerate": "The governor's claim can be seen as an exaggeration of the state's safety, as the available statistics do not support the claim of being the safest in the country."}
