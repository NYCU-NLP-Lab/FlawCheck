{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of New York's outmigration by stating that it has \"the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state.\" While it is true that New York had a significant net loss of residents to other states, it does not necessarily mean that it is the biggest outmigration compared to all other states.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which shows that New York lost a net 191,367 residents to other states between July 2015 and July 2016, more than any other state. However, it may be argued that more data and analysis are needed to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for New York's outmigration, focusing mainly on blaming Governor Cuomo's economic policies. However, it is possible that other factors, such as cost of living, job opportunities, or lifestyle preferences, also contribute to people leaving the state.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Governor Cuomo's economic policies are the main cause of New York's outmigration. While this may be a contributing factor, it is a problematic assumption to attribute the entire outmigration solely to his policies without considering other factors.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times."}
