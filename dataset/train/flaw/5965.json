{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the Burj Khalifa skyscraper displayed a photo of Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the image has been doctored and the original photo of the Burj Khalifa does not show Sharma or the Mumbai Indians logo.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate that the Burj Khalifa actually displayed a photo of Rohit Sharma. The expert's verdict clearly states that the image has been doctored.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image showing the Burj Khalifa with Sharma's photo and the Mumbai Indians logo is genuine, which is a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict states that the image has been doctored.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that the original photo of the Burj Khalifa was taken on a different occasion for the World Autism Awareness Day campaign, and not related to Rohit Sharma or the Mumbai Indians."}
