{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the water access issue in Gaza by stating that \"90 percent\" of people don't have access to water, without distinguishing between access to water and access to drinking water.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"90 percent\" of people in Gaza don't have access to water.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of access to water in Gaza is solely due to the Israeli occupation, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of access to water in Gaza, such as the impact of Hamas or other local factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that OCHA's report states that \"1.2 million people have no or very limited access to water or sanitation services\" due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel, rather than stating that 90 percent of people don't have access to water.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the severity of the water access issue in Gaza by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the situation and its impact on the population."}
