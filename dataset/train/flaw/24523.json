{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of guns sold by private, unlicensed sellers by stating it as nearly 40 percent, while the expert's verdict suggests that the actual range is 14 percent to 22 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a 1997 study that is considered old and limited in its scope.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of background checks in private sales leads to guns falling into the wrong hands, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the 1994 data used in the study did not have a category for online sales, indicating that the claim may not fully consider alternative explanations or factors."}
