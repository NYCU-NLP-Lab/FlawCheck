{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Facebook is taking down a photograph showing the interment of the remains of U.S. war dead returned by North Korea, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Facebook is taking down the mentioned photograph.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Facebook's actions are related to hiding President Trump's feat of returning Korean War dead, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph in question is not related to the recent return of remains of Americans killed in the Korean War, but rather a 2016 photograph from a stock photo service showing a German-Russian military ceremony.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the actions or motives of Facebook in relation to the photograph."}
