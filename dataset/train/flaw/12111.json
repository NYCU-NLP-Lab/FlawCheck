{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the controversy surrounding the Amul ad targeting Urmila Matondkar by stating that Kangana Ranaut became the \"epicentre\" of yet another controversy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Amul ad was specifically targeting Urmila Matondkar. It only mentions that the ad featured a caricature of her from her film 'Rangeela'.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Amul ad was a response to the controversy between Urmila Matondkar and Kangana Ranaut, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the Amul ad, such as it being a tribute to Urmila Matondkar's film 'Rangeela', as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
