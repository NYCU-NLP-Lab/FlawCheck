{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the GoFundMe fundraiser on Shane Patrick Boyle's death by stating that he died shortly after starting the campaign. The timeline provided in the expert's verdict indicates that Boyle started the campaign in February 2017 and died in March 2017, which may not necessarily be considered \"shortly\" after starting the fundraiser.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal link between Boyle's death and the GoFundMe fundraiser for insulin. The expert's verdict mentions that Boyle died after developing diabetic ketoacidosis, but it does not explicitly state that his death was a result of not being able to afford insulin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Boyle's death was solely due to not being able to afford insulin, without considering other potential factors that may have contributed to his condition or death.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions another individual, Alec Raeshawn Smith, who died after rationing insulin due to losing insurance coverage. This alternative explanation suggests that there may be multiple factors contributing to the deaths of individuals struggling to afford insulin, rather than solely attributing it to the lack of affordability.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Alec Raeshawn Smith did not set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for insulin, as indicated in the expert's verdict. This contradicts the claim's mention of a 26-year-old starting a GoFundMe campaign and dying after not receiving the required amount of insulin.", "Understate": "It is unclear if any biases related to understating exist in the provided claim and expert's verdict, as the information does not seem to downplay or minimize any aspect."}
