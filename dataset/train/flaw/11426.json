{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Nigeria bears the global sickle cell burden. The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the claim that Nigeria bears 50% of the global burden.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the claim that Nigeria bears 50% of the global sickle cell burden.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nigeria bears 50% of the global sickle cell burden without providing clear evidence or context to support this assumption."}
