{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Speaker Paul Ryan is blocking all incoming calls and faxes, as the expert's verdict states that fax numbers appear to connect normally and there is no evidence that all telephone calls to his office were being blocked.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Speaker Paul Ryan is blocking all incoming calls and faxes. The expert's verdict mentions that they found no evidence of such blocking and received normal connect responses from answering fax machines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Speaker Paul Ryan is intentionally blocking all incoming calls and faxes, while the expert's verdict suggests that it could be due to high call volume or other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the busy signals and difficulty in reaching Ryan's office could be due to high call volume rather than intentional blocking.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a constituent-only hotline exists to connect calls from individuals in Speaker Ryan's home district.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or support for the assertion that all incoming calls and faxes are being blocked."}
