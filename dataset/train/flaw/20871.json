{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor, as the overall crime rate in the state has actually declined by about 60 percent between 1980 and 2015.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fluctuations in California's crime rate over the past six to seven years, as stated by Jonathan Peterson from the California Legislative Analyst's Office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the increase in crime rates in some California cities in 2015 is solely attributable to Jerry Brown's tenure as governor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in crime rates in certain California cities, such as socio-economic factors or local law enforcement policies, which are not addressed in the claim."}
