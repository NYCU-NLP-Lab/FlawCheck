{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of having an active father on a child's likelihood of graduating from college. While the claim states that children are \"98 percent more likely\" to graduate from college with an active father, it may be an overstatement to attribute such a specific increase solely to the presence of an active father.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college. The evidence provided is based on a research brief by Bradford Wilcox, which uses data from a specific study but may not be representative of the overall population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between having an active father and the likelihood of graduating from college. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to a child's success, such as socioeconomic status, access to resources, or individual motivation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the correlation between having an active father and college graduation rates. It does not account for other factors that may contribute to a child's success, such as the involvement of the mother, the overall family environment, or external support systems.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its generalization by stating that having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college. It fails to acknowledge that individual circumstances and contexts can vary greatly, and not all children with active fathers will necessarily have the same outcome.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any biases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any established facts."}
