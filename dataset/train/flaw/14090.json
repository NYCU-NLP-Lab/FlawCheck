{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Tiger Woods has the greatest net worth of any professional sports figure is contradicted by the fact that Michael Jordan has a higher net worth if retired players are taken into account.", "Understate": "The claim underestimates the net worth of Michael Jordan, who reportedly has a net worth of $1.7 billion, more than double that of Tiger Woods.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Tiger Woods has the greatest net worth of any professional sports figure. It only mentions his net worth in 2018, without providing a comprehensive analysis of other athletes' net worth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tiger Woods' net worth is the highest among all professional sports figures, without considering the net worth of retired players or athletes from other sports.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the difference in net worth between Tiger Woods and other athletes, such as the rising value of NBA franchises and endorsement deals for other sports figures like Roger Federer and NBA icons LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant."}
