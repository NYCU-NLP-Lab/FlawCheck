{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Kamala Harris said looters are just feeding their hungry kids is not supported by any evidence or direct quotes from Harris herself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that looters are only motivated by the need to feed their hungry kids, which may not be the case for all instances of looting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for looting, such as opportunistic criminal behavior or a means of expressing anger and frustration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Harris has previously condemned looting and violence during protests.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the issue by reducing it to a simple statement about looters feeding their hungry kids.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a Facebook post without providing any additional context or verification.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating or misrepresenting Harris' stance on looting by attributing a statement to her that she did not make."}
