{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Trump endorses Duterte's daughter for president is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the photo has been doctored from a 2015 photo of Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a doctored photo and there is no evidence of an actual endorsement by Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the doctored photo is genuine and represents Trump's endorsement, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the doctored photo was created to falsely imply Trump's endorsement of Duterte's daughter for president."}
