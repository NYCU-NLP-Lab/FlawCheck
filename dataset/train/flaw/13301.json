{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows a car being swept down a river in China's Chongqing municipality in June 2020. The expert's verdict mentions that the video was published on Weibo and has been viewed more than 440 times, but it does not provide any additional evidence or sources to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video accurately depicts a car being swept down a river in China's Chongqing municipality in June 2020. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the same footage was published in 2017 and was reported on by Chinese media organizations at that time. This raises questions about the accuracy and relevance of the video to the claimed event in 2020.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the same footage was published in 2017, showing an off-road vehicle being washed into a river in Guizhou province. This alternative explanation suggests that the video may not be related to the claimed event in Chongqing in 2020."}
