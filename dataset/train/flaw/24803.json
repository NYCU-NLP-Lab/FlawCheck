{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video shows President Buhari's funeral, when in fact it is footage from a different funeral.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of military and a large crowd at the funeral indicates that the person being buried is a prominent figure, which may not necessarily be true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy theory that President Buhari died and was replaced by a body-double.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the video is footage from the funeral of former Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua, not President Buhari's funeral."}
