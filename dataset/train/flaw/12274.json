{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are only running ads against the candidate, when in fact there are other candidates who have also been targeted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that only Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are running ads against the candidate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the financial sector's opposition to the candidate is solely based on her record, without considering other possible reasons for their opposition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as it is mentioned that some Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers have expressed support for both Clinton and Sanders, indicating that their opposition may not be solely directed at the candidate."}
