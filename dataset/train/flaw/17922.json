{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the photo by stating that it shows the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in an airport queue. However, the photo is from 2017, before Khan became the prime minister.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the person in the photo is indeed Imran Khan. The only evidence provided is the Urdu-language caption of the post, which may not be sufficient to establish the identity of the person in the photo.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that standing in a queue at the airport is a significant indicator of a \"new Pakistan\" and a reason to praise Imran Khan. However, this assumption may be subjective and not universally agreed upon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the person in the photo is not Imran Khan but someone else who resembles him. Without further evidence, it is difficult to determine the true identity of the person in the photo.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is from 2017, before Imran Khan became the prime minister. Therefore, it is misleading to present it as a recent image of Khan standing in an airport queue."}
