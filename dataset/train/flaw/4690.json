The expert questions whether there are alternative explanations or other measures that were taken to close the deficits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting spending is the only way to close budget deficits, without considering other options such as raising taxes or transferring money in state accounts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there is a third option of transferring money in state accounts and using bookkeeping gimmicks to alter paper balances, which can also help address budget shortfalls. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged in the claim."}
