{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the rarity of leaks from rigs or pipelines by stating that they are \"very rare\" when in fact they occur roughly 40 times annually.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that oil spills from tankers are \"far more common\" than leaks from rigs or pipelines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is an \"unfortunate exception to the rule\" without providing evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the frequency of oil spills from tankers compared to leaks from rigs or pipelines."}
