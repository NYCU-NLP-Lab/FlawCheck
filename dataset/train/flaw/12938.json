{"Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement because it states that \"Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job,\" while the expert's verdict clarifies that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren't commensurate with their degree.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all kids coming out of school are unable to get a job, which may not be true for every individual.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the job market situation, such as economic factors or changes in the job market that go beyond the claim's statement."}
