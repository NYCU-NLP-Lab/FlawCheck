{"Lack enough support": "The claim states that \"Not a single megawatt of new generation has been procured in over five years from the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme.\" However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPP) has procured 6,422 megawatts of electricity from 112 independent power producers (IPPs) as of June 2020.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that no new generation has been procured from the REIPPP in over five years, implying a lack of progress or effectiveness. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the REIPPP has successfully procured a significant amount of electricity from IPPs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the fact that the REIPPP has been operational since 2010 and has already procured a substantial amount of electricity from IPPs. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that no new generation has been procured in over five years."}
