{"Understate": "The claim states that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first woman in American history to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, but the expert's verdict clarifies that she was actually the second woman, after Rosa Parks, to be honored in this way.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first woman to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that lying in state at the U.S. Capitol is the only criteria for being recognized as the first woman in American history to receive this honor, without considering other factors or distinctions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict explains the difference between lying in state and lying in honor, suggesting that Rosa Parks was laid in honor rather than in state, which challenges the claim's assertion that Ginsburg was the first woman to lie in state."}
