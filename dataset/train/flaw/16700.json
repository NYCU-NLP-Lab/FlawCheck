{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of money given to Iran under the Iran nuclear deal. The claim states that Obama gave Iran $150 billion, while the actual amount is disputed and believed to be much lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Iran will use the money to purchase bullets and shoot at U.S. soldiers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funds given to Iran were in the form of cash, when in reality, they were unfrozen assets that belonged to Iran.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for how Iran might use the unfrozen funds, such as economic development or domestic projects.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Iran nuclear deal involved multiple nations, not just the United States, and did not involve the United States giving cash to Iran.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the Iran nuclear deal and presenting a simplified and misleading narrative."}
