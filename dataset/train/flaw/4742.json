{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the disparity between the percentage of the population that is black and the percentage of abortions performed on African-Americans in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in abortion rates is solely due to race, without considering other factors such as unintended pregnancy rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that race is the determining factor in abortion rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the higher abortion rates among African-Americans, such as higher unintended pregnancy rates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the abortion rate for black women nationally is higher than the overall rate, indicating that race alone is not the determining factor.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by comparing the number of abortions obtained by black women to the entire black population, which is a false comparison."}
