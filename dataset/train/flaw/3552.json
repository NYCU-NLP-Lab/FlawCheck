{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that social science research supports the idea that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad. However, the expert's verdict points out that the studies cited by the claim actually focus on the effects of children growing up without a father in a one-parent household, rather than comparing gay and straight parents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or references to support the assertion that \"social science is irrefutable\" on this matter. The expert's verdict also mentions that the studies cited by the claim do not include any information on gay parenting specifically.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the studies cited do not actually address the effects of gay parents on children, but rather focus on the quantity of parents (one vs. two) and not their gender.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the studies cited by the claim do not measure what the claim asserts, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the outcomes mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by simplifying it to a binary choice between a mom and a dad, without considering other family structures or dynamics that may also contribute to a child's well-being.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the social science research on the topic, as pointed out by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the certainty and consensus within the field of social science by stating that it is \"irrefutable\" that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad. The expert's verdict suggests that the studies cited do not provide conclusive evidence on this specific topic."}
