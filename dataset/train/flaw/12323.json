{"Understates": "The claim may understate the existence of systemic racism in America by suggesting that Pence \"balked\" at the idea, implying that he completely rejected the notion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting statements from Pence. While he initially denied the existence of systemic racism, he later acknowledged its presence in the criminal justice system during Harris's tenure as San Francisco District Attorney.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pence's refusal to acknowledge systemic racism is problematic, as it fails to address the concerns and experiences of marginalized communities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully analyze Pence's stance on systemic racism, as it primarily focuses on his comments during the debate and does not provide a comprehensive overview of his views on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Pence's stance on systemic racism, such as differing political ideologies or beliefs about the role of government in addressing societal issues."}
