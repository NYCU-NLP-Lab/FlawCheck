{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Sen. Cochran's involvement in the Bridge to Nowhere project by stating that he \"voted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars\" on it. The actual amount of funding for the project was nearly $233 million.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sen. Cochran voted against an amendment that would have redirected funds from the Bridge to Nowhere to the repair of the I-10 Twin Span bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Sen. Cochran prioritized the Bridge to Nowhere over the repair of a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Bridge to Nowhere project was directly connected to the repair of a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina, which is not explicitly stated or supported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Sen. Cochran's vote on the Bridge to Nowhere project, such as political considerations or other factors that may have influenced his decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately portraying the timeline of events, as the Bridge to Nowhere project was decisively shuttered a few years after the Senate debate in October 2005, which was shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit.", "Understate": "The claim understates the opposition faced by Sen. Cochran in his decision to vote against redirecting funds from the Bridge to Nowhere to the repair of the I-10 Twin Span bridge, as Sen. Ted Stevens threatened to quit if the amendment passed."}
