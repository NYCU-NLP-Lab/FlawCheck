{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in attendance in various parliamentary sessions by presenting photos with sparse attendance for certain topics and full attendance for others. However, the expert's verdict reveals that the photos are miscaptioned and do not accurately represent the debates shown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on misleading captions and miscaptioned photos to make its point. The expert's verdict provides accurate descriptions of the photos, which contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the difference in attendance in the parliamentary sessions is solely due to the lack of interest or effort from the MPs. However, the expert's verdict states that an independent body sets pay and allowances for Australia's politicians, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the attendance variations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos are miscaptioned and do not accurately represent the debates shown. The expert's verdict provides accurate descriptions of the photos, which debunk the claim.", "Understate": "It is unclear if the claim understates any information or biases, as the provided information does not explicitly mention any instances of understatement.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not explicitly mention any instances of inconsistency or errors in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the difference in attendance in parliamentary sessions. The expert's verdict mentions that an independent body sets pay and allowances for politicians, suggesting that factors other than the MPs themselves may contribute to the attendance variations. However, the claim does not acknowledge or consider this alternative explanation."}
