{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the person in the photo is Leonardo DiCaprio's son, without providing any evidence or proof to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the person in the photo is actually Leonardo DiCaprio's son. The evidence provided, such as the comparison photos and the fact that DiCaprio is not known to have any children, contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the person in the photo is an exact copy of Leonardo DiCaprio based solely on their physical resemblance. This assumption is problematic as it does not take into account other possible explanations for the resemblance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photo, which is that it shows Leonardo DiCaprio with another actor or person at a public event. The evidence provided, such as the caption on the original photo, suggests that this is the case.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is not known to have any children. This fact is mentioned in the expert's verdict and undermines the claim's assertion that the person in the photo is his son."}
