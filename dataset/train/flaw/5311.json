{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Mitt Romney's stance on the Arizona immigration law by stating that he said it should be a model for the nation. The provided information suggests that Romney believed the law should be a template for federal immigration laws, but it does not explicitly state that he said it should be a model for the nation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or direct quotes from Mitt Romney to support the assertion that he said the Arizona immigration law should be a model for the nation. The information provided only includes statements made by President Obama and U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez about Romney's stance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's support for the Arizona immigration law means he believes it should be a model for the entire nation. This assumption may not accurately represent Romney's position on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's support for the Arizona immigration law. The claim does not explore other possible reasons for his stance or consider any alternative viewpoints."}
