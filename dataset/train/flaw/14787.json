{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on rumors and social media posts rather than verified facts or scientific evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the zodiac is about to change to include a \"new\" star sign, Ophiuchus, without providing sufficient evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the rumors and misinformation surrounding the inclusion of Ophiuchus in the zodiac, such as the misunderstanding of astrology and astronomy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the concept of Ophiuchus as an astrological sign has been present since at least 2002 and was referenced on a NASA webpage in 2011, indicating that it is not a new addition to the zodiac.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the rumored zodiac change, stating that it will \"shock\" people and \"change their world forever,\" without providing substantial evidence or reasoning for such dramatic claims.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the counterpoint presented by astrologers, who argue that the reported information about gravitational pull and star alignment will not affect the underlying system of astrology in the Western world."}
