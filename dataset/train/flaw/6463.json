{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites a single source, a St. Petersburg Times article, which does not directly address the allegation of funneling money to Bank of America.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sink's decision to create a blind trust for her personal investments is directly related to funneling money to Bank of America, without providing a clear connection or evidence of wrongdoing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Sink's decision to create a blind trust, such as the need to avoid conflicts of interest or allegations similar to those faced by her predecessor. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
