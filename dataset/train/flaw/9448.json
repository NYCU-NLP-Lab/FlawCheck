{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all undocumented immigrants are present in the United States without breaking any laws, which may not be true in all cases. The expert's verdict explains that while being present in the U.S. without documentation is not a crime in itself, there are certain circumstances under which it can be considered illegal entry.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to back up the statement made by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The expert's verdict mentions that the statement is widely attributed to Pelosi but does not provide specific details about when or where she made the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations to the claim by highlighting the legal distinctions in immigration law and the different ways undocumented immigrants may enter or stay in the United States without breaking any laws. This suggests that there are alternative explanations to the claim that someone who is here illegally hasn't necessarily broken any laws."}
