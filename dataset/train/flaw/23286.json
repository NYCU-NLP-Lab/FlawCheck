{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Cincinnati runs on clean energy. While the city does participate in a renewable energy credit program, it still receives its power from a traditional coal-burning electric utility.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to demonstrate that Cincinnati is one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy. The evidence provided only shows that a portion of the city's electricity comes from renewable sources through the renewable energy credit program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that running on clean energy means the city no longer uses \"dirty\" power. However, the explanation provided shows that the city still receives its power from a coal-burning electric utility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations for what it means to run on clean energy, such as using a mix of locally produced renewable electricity and renewable energy credits."}
