{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Gov. Chris Christie that he put \"10 percent of the state Legislature in jail\" during his seven years as U.S. Attorney is an exaggeration. The expert's verdict states that Christie's office charged and convicted less than 3 percent of all the people who served in the state Legislature during that time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts Christie's statement. The expert's analysis shows that Christie's office convicted a smaller percentage of state legislators than claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high number of convictions during Christie's tenure as U.S. Attorney is solely due to corruption in the state Legislature. However, the expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as local officials and individuals not currently in office, were also convicted during that time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that corruption in the state Legislature may not be the only reason for the convictions during Christie's tenure. The verdict mentions that both Republicans and Democrats were convicted, and that many convictions came from local officials, indicating that corruption may not be limited to the state Legislature alone."}
