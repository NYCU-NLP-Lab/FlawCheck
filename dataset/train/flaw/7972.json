{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Obama's promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan, as it is based on a speech where he mentioned reproductive care as essential but did not explicitly state it would be at the center.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a speech and an alert from Planned Parenthood, but it does not provide additional evidence or data to substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan includes abortion coverage, but this may be a problematic assumption as it is not explicitly stated in the claim or the speech.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Obama's promise, such as a broader focus on comprehensive reproductive health care rather than specifically on abortion."}
