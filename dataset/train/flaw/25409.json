{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation in New Zealand by using the phrase \"big surge\" to describe the increase in COVID-19 cases. The actual number of new cases reported in New Zealand was relatively low compared to other countries.", "Understate": "The claim understates the effectiveness of New Zealand's response to the virus by suggesting that they have not been successful in controlling it. However, New Zealand had gone over 100 days without any community spread before the recent cases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the statement that New Zealand has experienced a significant surge in COVID-19 cases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in cases in New Zealand is a negative development, without considering the context of the country's overall response and the measures taken to control the spread.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in cases in New Zealand, such as imported cases or localized outbreaks that are being effectively managed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New Zealand had successfully controlled the virus for over 100 days without any community spread before the recent cases. The claim suggests that New Zealand \"beat\" the virus, but the expert argues that it is a stretch to make such a claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the situation in New Zealand. It focuses on a small increase in cases without considering the overall context and effectiveness of New Zealand's response."}
