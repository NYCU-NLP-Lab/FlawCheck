{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"I released all my emails\" is exaggerated because the expert explains that Bush only turned over and made public the emails he was required to, similar to Clinton.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it suggests that Bush released all his emails, but the expert highlights that the emails were already a part of the state archives and could have been accessed by anyone who asked for them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because the exact number of emails Bush sent as governor is unknown, as the state archives have not confirmed it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that releasing the emails from his private server is equivalent to releasing all his emails, but this assumption is not confirmed by the Bush campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists because Clinton and Bush have both faced scrutiny regarding their email handling, and Bush's claim to have released all his emails does not differentiate him from Clinton."}
