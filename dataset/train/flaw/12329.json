{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that autopsies prove that COVID-19 is a blood clot, not pneumonia, and that the whole world has been wrong in treating the pandemic. The expert's verdict clarifies that COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that can cause pneumonia and lung damage due to blood clotting, but it is still caused by a virus.", "Understate": "No significant understatement bias is observed in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "No significant faltering bias is observed in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents autopsies in Italy as the sole basis for its assertions, without considering broader scientific consensus or evidence. The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 based on scientific knowledge and research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that COVID-19 should be fought with antibiotics, which is incorrect as antibiotics do not work against viruses. The expert's verdict clarifies that viruses do not respond to antibiotic treatment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge alternative explanations or consider other factors contributing to the treatment of COVID-19. The expert's verdict provides a more balanced perspective by considering the virus's nature, respiratory illness, and lung damage caused by blood clotting."}
