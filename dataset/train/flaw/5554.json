{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photos are of the Thai prime minister as a young man. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the photos were digitally manipulated and compares them to genuine photos from different sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos are genuine without providing any concrete proof. The expert's verdict highlights the digital manipulation of the photos and provides evidence of their origins from different sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos are digitally manipulated. The expert's verdict clearly states that the photos were found to be doctored through Google reverse image searches.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the attractiveness and wealth of the Thai prime minister as a young man. The expert's verdict mentions that the caption of the Facebook post describes the prime minister as \"very handsome and rich,\" but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
