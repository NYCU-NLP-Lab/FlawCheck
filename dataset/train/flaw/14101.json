{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Islamic messages were \"allowed\" on London buses, implying that it was a deliberate decision by the British government, when in fact the source and reason for the banners remain unclear.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the British government banned the Lord's Prayer in cinemas. The only reference to this is a Facebook post, which may not be a reliable source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the British government's actions regarding the Lord's Prayer and Islamic messages on buses are contradictory and biased against Christianity. However, there is no clear evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation suggested by a commenter on the Facebook post, stating that the Islamic message on the bus was for a Muslim festival and the bus was hired out from a bus company. This suggests that the banner may not have been government-sanctioned.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph of the Islamic message on the bus was taken in January 2015, not on December 4, 2015, as claimed in the Facebook post.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
