{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Syrian Muslims who are supposedly moving into the neighborhood, stating that it is 321 when there is no evidence to support this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that houses are being torn down to provide homes for Syrian Muslim refugees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of new houses and the tearing down of a funeral home are specifically for the purpose of accommodating Syrian Muslim refugees, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the construction of new houses and the tearing down of a funeral home, such as urban development or renovations, which are not considered in the claim."}
