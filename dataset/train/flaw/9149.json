{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which Virginia taxpayers would have been required to pay for abortions under Obamacare. The expert's verdict states that the General Assembly passed a measure to bar insurers from covering most abortions, indicating that there may have been some coverage for abortions in the exchange. However, the claim suggests that taxpayers would have been \"forced to pay for abortions,\" which may be an overstatement of the actual requirement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully substantiate the assertion that Virginia taxpayers would have been \"forced to pay for abortions\" under Obamacare. The expert's verdict provides information about the actions taken by the General Assembly and Governor McDonnell to restrict abortion coverage in the exchange, but there is no direct evidence or data presented to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that under Obamacare, Virginia taxpayers would have been required to pay for abortions in insurance plans under the newly created federal health care exchanges. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the Obamacare law allows states to prohibit abortion coverage in exchanges, indicating that it is not an automatic requirement. Therefore, the claim's assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions taken by the General Assembly and Governor McDonnell to restrict abortion coverage in the exchange. The expert's verdict mentions that Virginia lawmakers originally planned to create a state-run exchange and passed a bill banning most abortions from being covered. However, late last year, Governor McDonnell announced that Virginia would not create an exchange, leading to a federally run system. The claim does not acknowledge this alternative explanation for the restriction on abortion coverage."}
