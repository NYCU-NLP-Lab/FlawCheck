{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Governor Whitmer has banned buying US flags during the lockdown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the statement that buying US flags is banned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tweet showing American flags behind caution tape in a Costco store is evidence of a ban on buying flags.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Governor Whitmer's executive order does not mention flags and explicitly states that it does not ban Michiganders from buying any item, including flags.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of caution tape around the American flags in the Costco store, such as social distancing measures or temporary restrictions on certain sections of the store."}
