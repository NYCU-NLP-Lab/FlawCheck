{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of people who die from gun violence by using the number 32,000 instead of the more accurate number of 33,636 gun-related deaths in 2013.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim provides some evidence from the CDC's National Vital Statistics database, it may lack enough support to fully substantiate the claim that the CDC is banned from researching ways to prevent gun violence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC's research on preventing gun violence would be effective in reducing the number of deaths, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the limitations on CDC's research, such as the intention to prevent the CDC from lobbying for gun control rather than conducting gun-violence research."}
