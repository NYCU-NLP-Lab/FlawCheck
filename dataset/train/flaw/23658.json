{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that Primary Bank is the \"first and only\" bank founded since Dodd-Frank passed. There are other banks that have been founded since then.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of banks founded since Dodd-Frank passed. There have been multiple banks founded, not just one.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to back up the statement that Primary Bank is the only bank founded since Dodd-Frank.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the drop-off in new bank formation, such as FDIC policies set before Dodd-Frank and the overall economic picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drop-off in new bank formation is solely caused by Dodd-Frank, without considering other factors such as low interest rates and FDIC policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been other banks founded since Dodd-Frank, including the Bank of Bird-in-Hand and other banks listed by the FDIC.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing accurate information about the number of banks founded since Dodd-Frank and the reasons for the drop-off in new bank formation."}
