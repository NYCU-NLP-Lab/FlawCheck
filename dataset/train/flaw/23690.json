{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of women who decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. The expert's verdict mentions that the source of the claim is the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic group, which may have a bias towards promoting a pro-life agenda.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"upwards of 90 percent\" of women decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. The source cited by the expert is a page on the Knights of Columbus website, which may not provide reliable and unbiased information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that seeing an ultrasound image and hearing the baby's heartbeat will significantly influence a woman's decision to have an abortion. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to a woman's decision-making process regarding abortion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why women decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. Factors such as access to support, financial considerations, or personal circumstances could also play a role in a woman's decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the ultrasound provision in the bill signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker requires women in Wisconsin to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion. The claim suggests that women decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound, while the law implies that the ultrasound is a mandatory step in the abortion process.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing accurate and reliable information. The expert's verdict mentions that the bill requiring ultrasounds before abortion drew striking comments from senators, indicating controversy and potential bias surrounding the topic."}
