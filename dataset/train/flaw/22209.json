{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video shows a bolt of lightning striking a river contradicts the fact that the \"lightning\" strike actually comes from a wire on the hill.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the event by describing it as \"sparking a large explosion,\" when in reality it is a controlled blasting operation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or additional information to back up the assertion that it shows a lightning strike.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video depicts a natural occurrence of lightning striking a river, when it is actually a man-made blasting operation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the video shows a controlled blasting operation conducted by a Finnish water engineering company."}
