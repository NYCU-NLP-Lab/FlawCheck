{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the wealth of the United States by stating that it has \"never been richer\" based solely on per capita GDP.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by data from the Economic Research Service and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, it may be argued that this evidence is not sufficient to definitively support the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering by not considering other factors such as income inequality, which the expert mentions as a reason why it doesn't feel like the country is richer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that per capita GDP is the sole measure of a country's wealth, without considering other economic indicators or factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in per capita GDP, such as population growth or changes in income distribution."}
