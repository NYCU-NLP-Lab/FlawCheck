{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent\" is slightly exaggerated, as the actual increase is 11.9 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for how the 14 percent figure might have been calculated, indicating that there are different ways to interpret the data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not consider the alternative measure of real disposable personal income per capita, which shows a lower increase of 6.8 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in after-tax incomes is a positive measure of economic growth without considering other factors such as population growth or inflation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that \"Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years,\" suggesting a discrepancy between different claims about income growth."}
