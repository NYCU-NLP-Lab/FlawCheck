{"Exaggerate": "The claim may have a tendency to exaggerate the potential extinction of polar bears by stating that they may be \"wiped out\" by the end of the 21st century. The expert's verdict clarifies that the study did not directly state that all polar bears globally would be extinct by 2100.", "Understate": "There is no indication of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in its presentation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by the research published in July 2020, which analyzed 13 out of 19 Arctic polar bear subpopulations. However, the claim does not provide specific details or references to the research, which may be considered a lack of enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no evident problematic assumption in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no mention of alternative explanations in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. The expert's verdict supports the claim by stating that many polar bear subpopulations are likely to experience reproductive failure, potentially leading to extinction."}
