{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work. This may be an exaggeration as the evidence provided by the American Petroleum Institute (API) does not directly support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration may not be a perfect fit for the claim, as they include profits from products other than gasoline. This lack of precise data weakens the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government's take of gasoline sales is higher than the net income earned by the oil companies. However, the expert's verdict indicates that the evidence provided by the API may not be appropriate for assessing this notion, suggesting that the assumption made in the claim is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration include profits from products other than gasoline. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the overall financial situation of oil companies in relation to gas taxes."}
