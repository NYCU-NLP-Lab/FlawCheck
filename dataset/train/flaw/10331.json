{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned the sale or purchase of American flags during the COVID-19 pandemic is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that Whitmer did not ban the purchase of American flags during lockdown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single tweet and a photograph without clear origins. The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph may be genuine, but it does not provide conclusive evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph of caution tape around American flags in a store represents a ban on buying flags. However, the expert's verdict states that the photograph likely shows Costco's gardening department after it was cordoned off due to Whitmer's new restrictions, which does not necessarily imply a ban on flag purchases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, suggesting that it shows a cordoned-off gardening department rather than a ban on American flag purchases. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that Whitmer banned the sale or purchase of American flags during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there is no evidence to support this assertion.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single tweet and photograph as evidence, without providing additional supporting information or context."}
