{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim lacks sufficient support. The data used by World Vision to come up with the figure of one million school girls becoming pregnant across sub-Saharan Africa is based on localized and incompatible data from Tanzania and Sierra Leone. The experts argue that using such data is unreliable and does not support the claim made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by using data from Tanzania and Sierra Leone to represent the situation across sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. The experts argue that this is not a valid assumption and caution against using data gathered under varied and localized circumstances to speak to general conditions across the region.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that pandemic measures led to a surge in teenage pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa. The expert's verdict states that the data used by World Vision does not support this claim, and experts did not find evidence to back up the assertion made.", "Understate": "It is not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict whether the claim understates any aspect. However, it can be inferred that the claim may be understating the complexities and limitations of the data used to support the claim of one million school girls becoming pregnant during lockdown in sub-Saharan Africa.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear explanation of how the data from Tanzania and Sierra Leone was used to calculate the figure of one million school girls becoming pregnant. World Vision did not respond to questions about this calculation, indicating a lack of clarity and potential faltering in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly mention the existence of alternative explanations. However, it can be inferred that the claim may not consider alternative factors or explanations for the reported increase in teenage pregnancies, as it solely relies on the data from Tanzania and Sierra Leone.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not indicate any exaggeration in the claim. However, it highlights that the data used by World Vision is based on localized and incompatible data, suggesting that the claim may not accurately represent the situation across sub-Saharan Africa."}
