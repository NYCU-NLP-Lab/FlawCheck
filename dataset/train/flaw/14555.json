{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in gas prices since Barack Obama became president. The actual increase is $1.61 per gallon, but the claim states that the cost of a gas tank fill-up has risen $30.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the $30 increase in gas prices. The provided evidence only includes the prices per gallon and the fuel tank capacities of a few selected vehicles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in gas prices is solely due to President Obama's energy policies, without considering other factors such as global oil prices or market dynamics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in gas prices, such as changes in global oil markets or geopolitical factors.", "Understate": "The claim understates the increase in gas prices for vehicles with smaller fuel tank capacities. The analysis only focuses on vehicles with larger tank capacities, while ignoring the impact on vehicles with smaller tanks."}
