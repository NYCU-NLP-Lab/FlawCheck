{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of staying in secondary school on the chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS. The expert's verdict clarifies that the risk decreases by one-third, not half.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a single study from Botswana, which only examined the impact of one extra year of education. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim goes beyond what the research shows.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in HIV/AIDS risk is directly caused by staying in secondary school, without considering other factors that may contribute to the reduction. The expert's verdict mentions that the results are local to Botswana's high HIV prevalence and education reform.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the decrease in HIV rates could be attributed to other factors, as evidenced by two studies from Uganda that support the concept but not the specific numbers mentioned in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by stating that the risk decreases by half, while the research shows a decrease of one-third. This inconsistency is clarified in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the risk of getting infected with HIV/AIDS decreases by one-third, not half. The expert's verdict clarifies this contradiction.", "Other biases": "There are no other biases identified in the provided claim or expert's verdict."}
