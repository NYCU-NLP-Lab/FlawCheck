{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the link between the 13 percent increase in police-recorded crime in England and Wales and \"radical Islamic terror.\" The expert's verdict states that even the maximum possible increase in terrorist-related offenses could only have made a very small contribution to the overall increase in crime.", "Understate": "The claim understates the overall factors contributing to the 13 percent increase in police-recorded crime. The expert's verdict mentions that the increase reflects a range of factors, including improvements to crime recording and genuine increases in some crime categories.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a strong causal link between the increase in police-recorded crime and \"radical Islamic terror.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the source of the claim was a segment aired on a conservative network without providing evidence for the speculated connection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causation between the rise in crime and \"radical Islamic terror\" without sufficient evidence. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is grossly misleading and does not provide substantial evidence for the connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in police-recorded crime, such as other societal factors or changes in crime reporting and recording practices.
