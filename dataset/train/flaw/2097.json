{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Patrick Murphy \"never worked as a CPA\" and was \"never a small business owner\" when in fact he did work as a CPA for a period of time and had an economic interest in a small business.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that Patrick Murphy never worked as a CPA or small business owner.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that holding a lesser title before becoming a CPA and working as a CPA for less than a year disqualifies Murphy from being considered a CPA or small business owner.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that Murphy did work as a CPA, but in a different state while holding a Colorado CPA license, which may have led to confusion or misunderstanding."}
