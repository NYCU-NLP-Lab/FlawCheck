{"Understate": "The claim may understate the efforts and measures taken by communities of color, as well as state and local efforts, in reducing the racial disparities in COVID-19's impact in Michigan. The expert's verdict highlights the range of factors that have contributed to the decrease in disparities, including mask-wearing and local efforts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the racial disparity in COVID-19's impact has been \"flattened\" and \"significant progress\" has been made. The expert's verdict provides some data on the decrease in disparities, but it does not explicitly support the claim's statement of \"significant progress.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in racial disparities in COVID-19's impact is solely attributed to the steps taken by communities of color and state/local efforts. The expert's verdict highlights additional factors such as the changing geography of the virus and the surge in white COVID-19 cases and deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the decrease in racial disparities, including the changing geography of the virus and the surge in cases and deaths in other regions of Michigan. This suggests that factors beyond the efforts taken by communities of color and state/local efforts may have contributed to the decrease in disparities."}
