{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the hospital claimed to have 5,000 infected and 200 deaths from COVID-19, when in reality the hospital is still under construction and has not admitted any patients yet.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove the existence of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. The video only shows men entering a construction site, and there is no evidence or confirmation of any COVID-19 cases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the politicians are furious over nonexistent COVID-19 patients, without providing any evidence or explanation for their anger. It makes an assumption without sufficient justification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the politicians' actions, such as inspecting the construction progress or addressing other concerns related to the hospital. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
