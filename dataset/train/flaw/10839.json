{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Uber increased its prices in parts of London around the time of the terror attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Uber intentionally increased prices to take advantage of the terror attack, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Uber's price surge happened automatically due to algorithms that observed increased demand, and was later stopped by the company.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Uber suspended dynamic pricing and made all rides from the affected area free of charge shortly after the attack.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the price surge was a result of increased demand due to the terror attack, rather than intentional exploitation by Uber.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Uber increased its prices, as it does not provide specific information about the magnitude of the price surge."}
