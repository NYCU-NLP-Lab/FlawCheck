{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it implies that the photo is urging voters to reject an opposition candidate, while the evidence provided only shows President Duterte holding a banner with a message against the candidate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide substantial evidence or context to support the assertion that the photo is urging voters to reject the opposition candidate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the altered version of the photo is authentic and accurately represents President Duterte's stance on the opposition candidate, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the photo, such as it being a form of political expression or a personal opinion, rather than an official endorsement or call to action by President Duterte. However, the claim does not explore or acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
