{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the Georgia crackdown on illegal immigration by stating that it cost state farmers $400 million last year, when the actual figure projected by the UGA report is $391 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient support as it is based on a statement made by Georgia labor leader Charlie Flemming, who mentioned the $400 million figure during a rally. However, the source of this information is not provided, making it difficult to verify the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the losses of $391 million projected by the UGA report are solely attributable to the new immigration law in Georgia. However, the report also mentions indirect impacts on the state's economy, which may include factors beyond the scope of the law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the losses incurred by state farmers, such as natural disasters, changes in market demand, or other factors not related to the immigration law. The claim does not explore or consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the UGA report projected losses of $391 million, while the claim states that it cost state farmers $400 million. The claim may not accurately represent the findings of the report.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing incomplete information and not thoroughly examining the methodology and limitations of the UGA report. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the projected losses.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the impact of the Georgia crackdown on illegal immigration."}
