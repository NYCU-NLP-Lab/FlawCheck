{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Trump's comments on NATO's policy change. The creation of a new division focused on terror threats may not necessarily be solely attributed to Trump's remarks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Trump's comments directly led to NATO's policy change. The experts mentioned in the verdict state that the likeliest change referred to was the establishment of an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security, rather than a complete policy overhaul.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that NATO's policy change was a direct response to Trump's comments about NATO being obsolete. However, the experts suggest that the change was part of an ongoing process to improve intelligence sharing and was not primarily driven by Trump's remarks.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the specific policy change within NATO. It suggests a broader policy shift when the experts indicate that it was more of an internal reorganization of personnel and resources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for NATO's policy change, such as ongoing discussions and efforts to improve intelligence sharing within the alliance."}
