{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that 60% of Americans support legalizing marijuana. The expert mentions that the claim is based on multiple polls, but only provides information about a few of them.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert questions the validity of the claim, stating that it seems unlikely for support to jump from the low 50s to 60% in just a few weeks. This suggests that the claim may be based on an assumption that is not adequately supported.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the level of support for legalizing marijuana, as some polls show even higher percentages of support (e.g., 61%).", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there is another poll, the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, which found that 61% of Americans support the legalization of marijuana. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or sources of data that could influence the level of support.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of its accuracy or reliability. The expert questions the claim's accuracy based on the available polls and suggests that it may not be entirely reliable.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any factual information."}
