{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which China accounts for Kenya's external debt. The expert's verdict states that China is Kenya's largest bilateral creditor but accounts for less than 10% of the country's current external debt, which contradicts the claim's implication that China is a significant portion of Kenya's debt.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual amount owed to China. The expert's verdict mentions that the $6.4 billion figure provided in the claim is outdated and approximately $300 million less than the most recent data. There are also alternative figures mentioned, such as $6.7 billion and $7.1 billion, which indicate a higher debt owed to China.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the stated percentage of China's contribution to Kenya's external debt. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim's figure of less than 10% is not adequately supported by the provided evidence and data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes an assumption that \"external\" debt and \"total\" debt are interchangeable, which is considered problematic by experts. The expert's verdict states that these terms are not interchangeable and should not be used interchangeably.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative figures and explanations for the amount owed to China, indicating that there are alternative explanations and data sources that may differ from the claim's assertion."}
