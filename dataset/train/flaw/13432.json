{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Little Debbie's Cosmic Brownies are infested with worms. The only evidence provided is a Facebook video that appears to show worms on the brownies, but it is not conclusive proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the worms seen in the video came from the brownies themselves, without considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the worms in the video are most likely pantry moth larvae that developed at the supermarket or home storage stage. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the brownies are infested with worms.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by providing evidence that the insects found in Little Debbie's products are pantry moths, not worms.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough information or response from the person who made the claim, making it difficult to fully evaluate the veracity of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this case.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in this case."}
