{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that popular food and drink companies use \"aborted baby fetus cells\" to enhance the flavor of their products. There is no evidence to support this extreme claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that these companies use aborted fetal cells in their products. The only evidence provided is a disputed 2011 press release and an archived report from a biotechnology company, which does not prove the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of HEK 293 cells in research and development by Senomyx automatically translates to the use of aborted fetal cells in food and drink products. This assumption is not supported by the available evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the use of HEK 293 cells in research and development is for testing purposes and not for directly adding them to food and drink products. This alternative explanation is supported by the information provided about the cells' use in cancer research and other medical inquiries.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no U.S. food company is selling items to the public that contain aborted fetal cells. This is confirmed by the expert's verdict and the absence of credible evidence supporting the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect."}
