{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of tax increases on nearly everyone, suggesting that everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013, which is not entirely accurate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the tax increases primarily affect wealthier individuals, as only a small percentage of households are expected to report taxable income above the specified thresholds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that people believe only the wealthy will be affected by tax increases, without providing any evidence or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the tax increases, such as the expiration of the Social Security payroll tax holiday, which could have contributed to an increase in taxes for some individuals."}
