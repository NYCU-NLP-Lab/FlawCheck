{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or details to support the assertion that the police officer was aiming a rubber bullet gun at the little boy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the police officer's intention was to harm the little boy, without any concrete evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the perspective of the photograph may be misleading and the officer's weapon may be pointed in the vicinity of the person and the child, but not directly at them. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks or dangers associated with bringing a toddler to a protest or demonstration, as it questions \"Who brings a toddler to a 'riot'?\" without fully addressing the complexities and motivations behind such actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph is genuine, as confirmed by the expert's verdict."}
