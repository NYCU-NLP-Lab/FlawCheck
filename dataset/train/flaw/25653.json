{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that Common Core standards have been taught in Florida schools since 2010.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the implementation of Common Core standards in 2010 automatically means that students should be prepared for the assessment. However, this assumption may not be valid as the full implementation of the standards in all grades took place gradually over several years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Common Core standards were not fully implemented in all grades until later years. This is stated by Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association, who argued that the state hadn't yet fully implemented the standards.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it presents a broad statement that Common Core standards have been taught in Florida schools since 2010, without acknowledging the gradual implementation process and potential challenges faced during that period.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the concerns raised by educators and parents regarding the complexity of the school grading formula and the need for changes, which suggests that the implementation of Common Core standards may not have been smooth or without issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the changes in school grading and the need for a transition period, which could include factors other than the implementation of Common Core standards."}
