{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Barack Obama \"robbed Medicare of $716 billion to pay for Obamacare\" can be seen as an exaggeration. The expert's verdict explains that Obama did not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program's budget, but rather instituted changes to try to bring down future healthcare costs in the program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reductions in Medicare spending were a direct result of Obama's actions to fund Obamacare. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the reductions were aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries, and were part of efforts to reduce costs in the program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Obama specifically targeted Medicare to fund Obamacare. The expert's verdict provides a detailed explanation of the changes made to Medicare spending, which were aimed at reducing costs in the program overall.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the reductions in Medicare spending were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. This suggests that the claim may be overlooking this alternative explanation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama did not directly cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program's budget. The expert's verdict explains that the reductions in Medicare spending were part of efforts to bring down future healthcare costs in the program, rather than a direct cut to the budget.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
