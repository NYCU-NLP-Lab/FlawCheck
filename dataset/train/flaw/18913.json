{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that the white nationalist protesters had a permit while the counter-protesters didn't have a permit, which is not entirely accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the counter-protesters did have a permit, as confirmed by the Washington Post Fact Checker.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the white nationalist protesters had a permit while the counter-protesters did not.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that having a permit or not determines the legitimacy or legality of the protests, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that both the white nationalist protesters and the counter-protesters had permits for their respective demonstrations."}
