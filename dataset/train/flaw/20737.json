{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the finding by stating that the virus \"may have been present in the U.S. weeks earlier than scientists realized\". The expert's verdict clarifies that the study found evidence of the virus in December 2019, suggesting that coronavirus infections were present in the U.S. in December 2019, earlier than previously thought.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific details and evidence to support the assertion that the novel coronavirus was present in the U.S. weeks earlier than scientists realized. The expert's verdict provides more information about the study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which analyzed blood donations and found evidence of the virus in 1.1% of the samples.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. in December 2019 indicates widespread community transmission at that time. The expert's verdict clarifies that the presence of the virus in the U.S. at that time does not necessarily mean it was spreading widely in the community.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood bank donations. The expert's verdict mentions the possibility of false-positive antibody tests, which could be an alternative explanation for the presence of antibodies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any facts, as it is based on the findings of a study. However, it may be interpreted as contradicting the previous understanding of when the virus arrived in the U.S.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the findings of the study, as it accurately states that the study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 2019 blood bank donations and found evidence of the virus in December 2019.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at any specific point, as it is a general statement about the findings of a study. The expert's verdict provides additional context and limitations of the study but does not point out any specific faltering in the claim."}
