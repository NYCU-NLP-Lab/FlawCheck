{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is evidence of a correlation between the mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization, but it also states that there is not enough evidence yet to determine the extent of the mask rule's influence on stabilization.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the health secretary judged the rule's effectiveness three weeks after its implementation, which could be seen as a problematic assumption as it may not be immediately clear whether the stabilization is directly caused by the mask requirement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that other factors such as social distancing or testing availability could also play a role in the stabilization, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the observed trends.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is hard to quantify the impact of the mask law on the case count, indicating that the claim may falter at times in providing clear evidence for the direct correlation.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may understate the complexity of the situation by stating a direct correlation without considering other contributing factors."}
