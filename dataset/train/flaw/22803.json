{"Understate": "The claim understates the frequency of tear gas usage by Customs and Border Protection agents during the Obama administration. The expert's verdict states that tear gas was used 1.3 times per month on average between 2012 and 2016, whereas the claim simply states \"about once a month.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that tear gas was used at a rate of about once a month during the presidency of Barack Obama. The expert's verdict provides specific data and references to back up their assessment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the use of tear gas, such as the specific circumstances or reasons behind each deployment. It presents a general statement without providing any context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that tear gas was used 1.3 times per month on average during the Obama administration, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim's assertion of tear gas usage \"about once a month\" is not accurate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the frequency of tear gas usage by Customs and Border Protection agents during the Obama administration. The expert's verdict provides a more precise average of 1.3 times per month, while the claim presents a rounded estimation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the frequency of tear gas usage during the Obama administration. It simplifies the data and does not provide the full context or specific years covered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tear gas usage during the Obama administration is comparable to the specific incident mentioned in the expert's verdict, where tear gas was used on a group of migrants. It does not consider other potential factors or differences in circumstances."}
