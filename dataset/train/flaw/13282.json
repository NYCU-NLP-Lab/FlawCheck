{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the video shows police officers beating citizens in the United States. It is stated that the video was actually taken in Belgrade, Serbia, during protests against the re-implementation of a curfew related to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows police officers beating citizens in the United States without providing any concrete evidence or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was not taken in the United States, as many social media users inferred, but in Belgrade, Serbia.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that the video shows police officers \"beating citizens\" without providing further details or evidence of the severity or extent of the alleged beating.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the video was taken in a different country (Serbia) during protests against a curfew, rather than in the United States.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the impact of the video being misleading or miscaptioned, as it states that occasionally a piece of footage would go viral with misleading information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading caption that suggests the video was taken in the United States, when it was actually taken in Belgrade, Serbia."}
