{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the estimated number of children at the border, as it states that the Obama administration estimates it will increase to 150,000 to 200,000 next year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the estimate of 150,000 to 200,000 children at the border next year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the assumption that the month-over-month rate of increase in arrivals will continue, which may be seen as a problematic assumption as it is not guaranteed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the estimated increase in the number of children at the border, such as changes in political or economic conditions in the countries of origin."}
