{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the amount of money wasted by Bruce Rauner, as it states that he wasted $1 billion with his budget crisis without providing specific evidence or details to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Bruce Rauner wasted $1 billion with his budget crisis. The ad does not provide any specific information or sources to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bruce Rauner is solely responsible for the $1 billion wasted with the budget crisis, without acknowledging the role played by other political actors such as House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the budget crisis and the bill backlog, such as the expiration of a temporary state income tax increase and disagreements between the governor and Democrats on policy and spending priorities."}
