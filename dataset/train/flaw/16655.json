{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or support from legitimate sources, such as reports from Hollywood or direct connections to the Star Wars movies.", "Falters at times": "The claim is undermined by the fact that the same post was made about Las Vegas, which was debunked by Snopes.com in 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a Star Wars movie is being shot near Rosenberg, Texas, without any verified information or official announcements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the disclaimer on the WBN12 website, which states that it is a satirical and fantasy website, and none of the articles should be considered true.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the casting call for alien extras in a Star Wars movie, presenting it as a confirmed fact when there is no supporting evidence."}
