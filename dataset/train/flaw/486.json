{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the new USCIS guidance by suggesting that all children born to U.S. service members and government employees overseas will no longer be automatically considered citizens of the United States. The expert's verdict clarifies that the guidance only affects a relatively small number of cases involving non-U.S. citizen parents or adopted foreign-born children.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the statement that children born to U.S. service members and government employees overseas will no longer be automatically considered citizens of the United States. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information and references the USCIS guidance to support their assessment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new USCIS guidance applies to all children born to U.S. service members and government employees overseas, without considering specific circumstances such as the citizenship status of the parents. The expert's verdict clarifies that the guidance primarily affects cases involving non-U.S. citizen parents or adopted foreign-born children.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or potential exceptions to the new USCIS guidance. The expert's verdict mentions that the changes primarily apply to children born to non-citizen parents, and not to the majority of children born to U.S. citizen parents serving abroad.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the new USCIS guidance does not eliminate ordinary birthright citizenship for children of U.S. service members and government employees who are born outside the U.S. The expert's verdict highlights this contradiction and provides accurate information about the impact of the guidance.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the new USCIS guidance by suggesting that all children born to U.S. service members and government employees overseas will no longer be automatically considered citizens of the United States. The expert's verdict clarifies that the guidance only affects specific cases involving non-U.S. citizen parents or adopted foreign-born children.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication that the claim falters at times, as it only presents a single statement without any further analysis or conflicting information. The expert's verdict, however, provides more nuanced information and corrects any inaccuracies or misunderstandings."}
