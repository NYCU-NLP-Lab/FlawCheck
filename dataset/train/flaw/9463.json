{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the infestation by stating that the chocolates are \"crawling with maggots.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the videos show pieces of Ferrero Rocher chocolates infested with insects, but it does not specify the exact number or extent of the infestation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Ferrero Rocher chocolates are commonly infested with maggots. The expert's verdict mentions that insect infestation is not a common manufacturing problem with Ferrero Chocolates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the videos showing the infested chocolates are a reliable representation of a common problem with Ferrero Rocher chocolates. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the company disputed the claim and stated that infestation can occur during storage and distribution if not stored in ideal conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the infestation, stating that pests can penetrate confectionery packaging and infestation can occur if the product is stored with or near infested food products or pet products. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the infestation shown in the videos, such as improper storage conditions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that insect infestation is not a common manufacturing problem with Ferrero Chocolates, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting the videos as definitive proof of a common problem with Ferrero Rocher chocolates, without considering the company's response and alternative explanations provided in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
