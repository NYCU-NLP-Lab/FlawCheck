{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video has been circulating online since December 2019, which is eight months before the Home Minister tested positive for COVID-19.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the video and the Home Minister's COVID-19 diagnosis, implying that Muslims were celebrating and taking out a funeral procession specifically because of the Minister's diagnosis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a direct link between the video and the Home Minister's COVID-19 diagnosis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the men in the video are Muslims without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it shows a police barricade with the text \"Kolkata Traffic Police\" at a certain point, suggesting that it may not be related to the Home Minister's COVID-19 diagnosis."}
