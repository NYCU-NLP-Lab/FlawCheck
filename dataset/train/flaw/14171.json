{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the closure of all schools in Canada for the rest of the school year, while in reality, schools in Canada's provinces have not yet been shut down through the year's end.", "Understate": "The claim understates the extent of the employment insurance benefits in Canada, suggesting that every family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, while in reality, the benefits are targeted towards Canadian workers who have lost income due to the coronavirus.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that banks were notified to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months. The expert's verdict mentions a six-month, interest-free moratorium on student loans, but there is no mention of the suspension of mortgage payments for that length of time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all families in Canada will receive $950 every two weeks, which is not supported by the expert's verdict. The employment insurance benefits are specifically for those who have lost income due to the coronavirus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the measures mentioned, such as the specific criteria for receiving the employment insurance benefits or the conditions for deferring mortgage payments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that schools in Canada have not been closed for the rest of the school year. The expert's verdict states that no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year as of March 25."}
