{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the concealed-gun permit law by stating that firearms homicides are down about 40 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that firearms homicides decreased by 40 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the concealed-gun permit law is solely responsible for the decrease in firearms homicides, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in firearms homicides, such as changes in overall crime rates or other gun control measures implemented in Texas.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the starting point for judging changes in deaths by firearms, as the law took effect in 1996 but the claim uses data from 1993.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the concealed-gun permit law took effect in 1996, not 1993 as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential negative consequences or unintended effects of the concealed-gun permit law, as it only focuses on firearms homicides and does not consider other types of gun violence or related issues."}
