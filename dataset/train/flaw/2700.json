{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Joe Kyrillos that he voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 80s is an exaggeration, as he actually voted against it in 2005.", "Lack enough support": "Kyrillos' claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the actual voting records and facts presented by PolitiFact New Jersey.", "Problematic assumption": "Kyrillos assumes that his vote against the minimum wage in the 80s would be seen as more favorable than his vote against it in 2005, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Kyrillos' claim, which is that he may be trying to distance himself from his more recent vote against the minimum wage increase."}
