{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it presents the BLM T-shirt as the \"new Target uniform,\" implying that all Target employees are required to wear it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the BLM T-shirt is indeed the new Target uniform. The only evidence provided is a screenshot of a Facebook post and a photo of a person wearing the T-shirt with a Target name tag.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a Target employee wearing a BLM T-shirt automatically means it is the new uniform, without considering alternative possibilities.", "Alternative explanation": "The Target spokesperson clarifies that the T-shirt shown in the posts is not the company's new uniform and explains the actual dress code guidelines for Target employees. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim."}
