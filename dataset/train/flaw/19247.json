{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the proposed ban on coal mining in Tennessee by suggesting that all coal is located above 2,000 feet in elevation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2,000-foot elevation level is the only factor determining the presence of coal in Tennessee, disregarding other potential factors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that all coal in Tennessee is above 2,000 feet.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the existence of alternative explanations for the 2,000-foot elevation level, such as the U.S. Forest Service's classification of ecological subregions."}
