{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Barack Obama has announced a bid to become Secretary General of the United Nations, when in fact, he has made no such announcement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single unconfirmed report from a Kuwaiti newspaper, which is described as \"far-fetched\" and does not cite any sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Barack Obama's bid for the position of Secretary-General is a possibility, without considering the fact that the position requires nomination by the U.N. Security Council, which could be vetoed by any of its permanent members.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Barack Obama, being from a major power and having achieved international fame, would be an unlikely choice for the role of U.N. Secretary-General, as most Secretaries-General are compromise candidates from middle powers with little prior fame."}
