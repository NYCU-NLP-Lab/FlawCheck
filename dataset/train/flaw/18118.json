The expert's verdict provides additional information about Issa's interactions with protesters and his reasons for being on the rooftop.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Issa was not hiding on the rooftop but was in plain view. The expert's verdict confirms this contradiction.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
