{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made in the purported screenshot by stating that Australian health authorities admit tests cannot distinguish COVID-19 from other diseases. The expert's verdict clarifies that the screenshot was taken out of context and refers to COVID-19 positive people continuing to test positive after the infectious period has passed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a screenshot and does not provide any additional evidence or context to support the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the PCR test mentioned in the screenshot is unable to distinguish between COVID-19 and other diseases. The expert's verdict clarifies that the PCR test is designed specifically for SARS-CoV-2 and reliably detects its RNA.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the statement in the screenshot and assumes that it implies the inability to distinguish COVID-19 from other diseases. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that the statement refers to COVID-19 positive individuals testing positive after the infectious period has passed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the PCR test used in Australia is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and can reliably detect its RNA.
