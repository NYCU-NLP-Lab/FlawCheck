{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only mentions that a video showed pro-Trump rioters pepper-spraying police officers during the Capitol riot. The expert's verdict provides more context and evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video accurately represents the events of the Capitol riot without providing any further evidence or context. The expert's verdict provides additional information to support the authenticity and accuracy of the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the events shown in the video. The expert's verdict provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the altercation, offering alternative explanations for the actions of both the rioters and the police officers."}
