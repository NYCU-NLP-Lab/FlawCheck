{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Keystone XL pipeline on unlocking the Canadian tar sands. The expert's verdict suggests that the impact of the pipeline on tar sands production is relatively small, as oil drilling companies have been extracting oil from the tar sands and transporting it to the United States for years.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential environmental impact of the Keystone XL pipeline. The expert's verdict mentions that extracting crude oil from the tar sands is expensive, energy-intensive, and produces significant carbon emissions, which critics argue will contribute to climate change.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Keystone XL pipeline is necessary for unlocking the Canadian tar sands. However, the expert's verdict states that Canadian officials and oil producers have vowed to extract and transport the oil to the American marketplace by other means, regardless of the pipeline.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that Keystone XL means unlocking the Canadian tar sands. The expert's verdict suggests that the impact of the pipeline on tar sands production is relatively small and that oil extraction and transportation from the tar sands will continue regardless of the pipeline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the impact of the Keystone XL pipeline on tar sands production. The expert's verdict mentions that trains and existing pipelines already carry Western Canadian crude oil into the United States, indicating that there are alternative means for transporting the oil."}
