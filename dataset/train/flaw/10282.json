{"Understate": "The claim may understate the requirement for customers to wear masks in Pennsylvania stores. The expert's verdict states that the Worker Safety Order mandates essential businesses to require all customers to wear masks and deny entry to those not wearing them. However, the claim only mentions that masks are suggested, not required.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to support the assertion that Pennsylvania stores refusing to serve maskless customers should be reported. It simply provides a phone number for the Pennsylvania Department of Health without further justification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that stores refusing to serve maskless customers should be reported without considering potential alternative explanations or circumstances. The expert's verdict mentions that stores have the right to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask as defined in the Worker Safety Order. However, the claim does not acknowledge this exception and assumes that all stores refusing maskless customers should be reported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for stores refusing to serve maskless customers. The expert's verdict mentions that stores have the right to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask, and there may be valid reasons for this, such as following safety guidelines and protecting the health of employees and other customers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that masks are required in Pennsylvania stores according to the Worker Safety Order. The claim states that masks are suggested, not required, which goes against the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
