{"Lack enough support": "The claim that President John F. Kennedy made the statement about the CIA and the Pentagon is not supported by any evidence or official sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quote attributed to Kennedy is accurate without providing any credible sources or proof.", "Contradict fact": "The experts' verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no evidence or archival records of Kennedy making such a statement.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of evidence and support for the quote, as well as the fact that it is widely circulated on social media without any credible source.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The quote attributed to Kennedy actually originated from a 1963 article by Richard Starnes, not from Kennedy himself."}
