{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of open space being lost to development by stating that New Jersey is losing \"50 football fields of open space to development every day,\" when the actual figure is closer to 33 football fields per day.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual impact of development on flooding by suggesting that \"the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream,\" without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that development is directly causing increased flooding downstream.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between development and flooding without considering other factors that may contribute to flooding, such as natural weather patterns or inadequate infrastructure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in flooding, such as changes in climate or inadequate flood control measures."}
