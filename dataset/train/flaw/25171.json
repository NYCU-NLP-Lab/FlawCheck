{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the use of pepper spray on the child, as the expert's verdict states that the child was teargassed rather than pepper sprayed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a screenshot of a Facebook post, which may not provide sufficient evidence to verify the incident accurately.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the child approached the police for help in finding his mother, but it may not be the only reason for the interaction between the child and the police.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that the child was teargassed rather than pepper sprayed, indicating that the claim may not accurately represent the incident."}
