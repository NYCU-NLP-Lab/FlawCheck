{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the brown liquid turning milky white in the presence of water is a creation of fake milk. The only evidence provided is the color change, which can apply to other chemical concoctions as well.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the brown liquid turning milky white is a milk substitute beverage, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation that the brown liquid is likely the antiseptic liquid formulation of Dettol, which turns milky white when diluted with water. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of fake milk creation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the brown liquid is not fake milk but rather an antiseptic liquid solution.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the chemical reaction and assumes it to be a simple creation of fake milk, without considering other factors involved in the process.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the video in demonstrating the creation of fake milk, as it lacks sufficient evidence and alternative explanations are provided."}
