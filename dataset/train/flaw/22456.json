{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks reliable research or published studies to support the statistic that 150 people die each year from falling coconuts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that falling coconuts pose a significant risk to human life, without providing concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the comparison between deaths from falling coconuts and shark attacks is a trope used to portray sharks as less dangerous than they actually are. This implies that there may be alternative explanations for why this claim is made."}
