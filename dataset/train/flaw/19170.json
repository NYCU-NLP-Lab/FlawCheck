{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the voter roll purge by stating that \"more than 200,000 registered Wisconsin voters will be prohibited from voting.\" The expert's verdict mentions that up to 234,000 Wisconsin residents are at risk of being removed from the voter rolls, but it does not explicitly state that all of them will be prohibited from voting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that \"more than 200,000 registered Wisconsin voters will be prohibited from voting.\" It lacks sufficient support to validate the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive explanation of the context and reasons behind the voter roll purge. The expert's verdict provides additional information about the controversy, lawsuits, and court actions surrounding the issue, indicating that it is a complex and ongoing matter.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the voter roll purge will result in the prohibition of voting for the mentioned number of registered voters. However, the expert's verdict mentions that state officials want to delay forcing people off the rolls until 2021, indicating that not all of those people have actually moved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the voter roll purge or potential reasons why certain voters may be removed from the rolls. The expert's verdict mentions that the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent letters to voters who they believed may have moved based on information received from various sources."}
