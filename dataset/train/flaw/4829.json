{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Obama's decision to end the Secure Communities program by stating that it \"wiped away\" a program that allowed for shared fingerprinting to identify those who are here legally and illegally. The expert's verdict clarifies that state and local law enforcement agencies still send fingerprints to Washington, and what has changed is how federal officials use that information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Secure Communities program was the only way to identify individuals who are here legally or illegally. The expert's verdict explains that there are alternative methods and processes in place to identify and deal with immigration violations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that ending the Secure Communities program means that authorities \"don't really care\" about who is in the country. The expert's verdict provides additional information about the program and its limitations, suggesting that the decision to end it was not indicative of a lack of concern for immigration enforcement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that state and local law enforcement agencies still send fingerprints to Washington, even after the Secure Communities program was ended. This contradicts the claim that the program allowed for shared fingerprinting to identify individuals who are here legally or illegally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decision to end the Secure Communities program, such as concerns about civil liberties, cooperation from local jurisdictions, or the effectiveness of the program in achieving its goals. The expert's verdict provides additional context and alternative explanations for the decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying the issue and presenting a one-sided perspective. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced analysis of the situation and highlights the complexities involved in immigration enforcement and the Secure Communities program."}
