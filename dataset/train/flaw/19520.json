{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerated because it suggests a direct connection between Ted Cruz's father and Lee Harvey Oswald, implying involvement in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Ted Cruz's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald before the assassination.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the National Enquirer report and the photo analysis it relied upon are accurate and conclusive, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the presence of an unidentified man in the photo with Lee Harvey Oswald, and the claim does not consider these possibilities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements made by Rafael Cruz and several historians who have not seen any connection between Cruz's father and Oswald.", "Understate": "It can be argued that the claim understates the controversy and sensationalism surrounding the accusation made by Donald Trump."}
