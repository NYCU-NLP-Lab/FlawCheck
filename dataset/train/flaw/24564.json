{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the photo shows a man wearing a \"government issue Saint Laurent hazardous materials suit,\" when in reality, it shows someone wearing a costume resembling Walter White from Breaking Bad.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or additional information to back up the statement about the man wearing a hazardous materials suit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that the person in the photo is an intern at Doctors Hospital and that the hospital has placed the infected patient in isolation until they can repair the furnace in the morgue for treatment. There is no evidence or confirmation of these claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for the photo could be that it is a joke or parody, as the post comes from a self-described parody account and the person in the photo is actually a taxi driver in Siberia.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is not depicting a real government issue hazardous materials suit, but rather a costume.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by mixing factual information about the COVID-19 cases in Florida with jokes and misleading statements, which can confuse readers and lead to misinterpretations."}
