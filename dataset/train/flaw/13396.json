{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Watkins \"bragged to voters that he built his company from scratch, but it was all a lie.\" While Watkins did not own the company, he did oversee a division and played a role in its growth.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the accusation that Watkins lied about building his company. While there is evidence that he did not own the company, there is also evidence that he played a significant role in its growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Watkins did not own the company, his statement about building it was a deliberate lie. However, it is possible that Watkins genuinely believed he played a significant role in its growth and considered it as building the company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Watkins may have used the phrase \"built the company\" in a broader sense, referring to his role in its growth rather than literal ownership."}
