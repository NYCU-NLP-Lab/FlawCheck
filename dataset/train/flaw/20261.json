{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it contradicts the fact that John McCain was closely identified with the term \"maverick\" during the 2008 presidential campaign.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one quote from John McCain stating that he never considered himself a maverick.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that John McCain's statement is the definitive truth and ignores instances when he or his campaign used the term \"maverick\" to describe him.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for John McCain's statement, such as political strategy or a shift in his self-perception, which are not explored in the claim."}
