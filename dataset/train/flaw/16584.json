{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Wisconsin has the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country, as previous similar claims have been rated as false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it relies on a 2015 Pew report, while more recent data is available that could provide a more accurate assessment of the middle class decline in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the shrinking middle class in Wisconsin is solely attributed to the policies of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, without directly blaming him. However, it is not clear if other factors or external influences contribute to this trend.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the shrinking middle class in Wisconsin, such as economic shifts, changing demographics, or national trends that may impact multiple states."}
