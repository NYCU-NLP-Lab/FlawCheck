{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of President Trump's actions by suggesting that he \"returned prayer\" to public schools, implying that prayer was completely banned before his actions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the existing freedom of students and student groups to pray and participate in religious activities in public schools.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the assertion that President Trump \"returned prayer\" to public schools, as it is stated that his actions largely restated a guideline created by President George W. Bush.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 1962 Supreme Court ruling in Engel v. Vitale, which barred schools and employees from prescribing or requiring prayer, equated to banning prayer altogether in public schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is presented in the expert's verdict, stating that President Trump's actions were seen as a nod to his voting base of evangelicals and reflected a popular idea among conservative Christians."}
