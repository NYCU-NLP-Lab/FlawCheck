{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of hotel guests who will pay the new fee by stating that about 85 percent will be from outside Georgia. The expert's verdict provides data that suggests the actual percentage may be slightly lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement. The expert's verdict provides additional information and data from surveys and studies to support or challenge the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new fee will be passed along to hotel guests, but the expert's verdict states that there is nothing that says the fee must be passed along. This assumption may be problematic as it could affect the accuracy of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for who will be paying the fee. The expert's verdict provides data from a website run by stadium advocates that suggests a slightly higher percentage of overnight guests in the state's largest hotel market are from outside Georgia. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing clear and consistent information. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is based on statements made by former state rep. Jay Roberts, but also provides additional data and perspectives that may contradict or challenge the claim."}
