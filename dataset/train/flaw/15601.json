{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Beninese attacked the Nigerian Embassy in Benin over the border closure. The evidence provided is a video that has been shared on social media platforms, but there is no direct evidence or credible sources confirming the attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing an attack on the Nigerian embassy in Cotonou is related to the border closure issue. However, there is no clear connection established between the two events.", "Contradict fact": "The Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Benin denies that there was any attack on the Nigerian embassy in Cotonou. This contradicts the claim made in the video and raises doubts about its accuracy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video analyzed in the claim is not recent and has been circulating since 2013, showing an attack on the Nigerian embassy in Dakar, Senegal. This alternative explanation suggests that the video may not be related to the border closure issue in Benin.", "Understate": "There is no evidence provided in the claim to suggest that the video has been widely shared and viewed by a significant number of people. The claim mentions the number of shares and views on social media platforms, but these numbers are relatively low compared to the population of Nigeria and the reach of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the border closure by stating that it has especially affected Benin and cast a shadow over the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. While the closure may have some impact on trade, the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support these exaggerated claims.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent narrative. It mentions different versions of the video with varying captions and claims, making it difficult to determine the accuracy and reliability of the information presented."}
