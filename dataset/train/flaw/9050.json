{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college.\" It only refers to a 2011 report and analysis, which may not accurately represent the current situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on outdated data from 2011-2012. The current percentage of Hispanic students relying on Pell Grants may have changed since then.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The proposed funding cut to Pell Grants is based on the argument that the program has been running a surplus for years and that the money could be better spent elsewhere. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that 50% of Hispanic students rely on Pell Grants.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the proposed education appropriations legislation would cut Pell Grant funding, which could potentially affect the availability and accessibility of Pell Grants for Hispanic students.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the reliance on Pell Grants by Hispanic students if the current percentage is higher than 50%. The claim only provides data from 2011-2012, which may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the reliance on Pell Grants by Hispanic students. The available data from 2011-2012 supports the claim, but it may not be up to date.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reliance on Pell Grants by Hispanic students is a significant issue that needs protection. This assumption may be seen as problematic by those who argue for reallocating funds from the program due to a surplus."}
