{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Joe Biden's alleged use of technological aids during the debate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Joe Biden wore a \"wire\" and high-tech contact lenses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a line on Biden's shirt and the appearance of his eyes in a photograph are proof of him wearing technological aids.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the observed phenomena, such as the line on Biden's shirt being a crease in the material and Biden's eye color appearing darker in a photograph due to lighting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mojo Vision, the company allegedly providing the high-tech contact lenses, stated that only their team has worn their smart contact lens and it doesn't have FDA clearance yet.", "Understate": "It is not clear if any biases in the claim can be classified as understating."}
