{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates President Ronald Reagan's efforts to build a border wall by stating that he tried for eight years, when in fact there was no discussion or attempt to build a wall during his administration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Reagan did not try to build a border wall during his presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to prove that President Reagan attempted to build a border wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Reagan's failure to build a border wall is comparable to President Trump's efforts, without considering the different political contexts and circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that other administrations and agencies have succeeded in building walls in sections along the U.S.-Mexico border, contradicting the notion that no progress has been made in this regard."}
