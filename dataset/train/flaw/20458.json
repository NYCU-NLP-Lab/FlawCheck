{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden legally won the presidential election, as it is stated that all 50 states and the District of Columbia certified the results affirming his win.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that not one court has looked at the evidence and said that Biden legally won the presidential election, as it is stated that Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in state and federal courts to challenge the election results, and not one of them proved that voter fraud affected the outcome.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or examples to back up the assertion that not one court has looked at the evidence and said that Biden legally won the presidential election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that courts are the sole authority to determine whether a presidential candidate won an election, when in fact it is up to the states to administer elections and count votes, and the results have already been certified by the states and finalized by Congress.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that Biden won the presidential election through legitimate means, as there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud and election officials in every state said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process."}
