{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the differences between absentee voting and mail-in voting by suggesting that absentee voting has more protections against fraud.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that absentee voting has more protections against fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a significant difference between absentee voting and mail-in voting in terms of fraud protections, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that absentee and mail-in ballots are the same thing and that all mail ballots, regardless of how they are requested, are treated the same once they're cast. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim."}
