{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that President Obama is unnecessarily delaying flights, which may be an exaggeration as the delays are a result of budget cuts and furloughs of air traffic controllers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the FAA could cut other spending to avoid flight delays, without providing evidence or considering the potential consequences of those cuts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that President Obama is intentionally delaying flights or that there are viable alternatives to the furloughs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the flight delays are a direct result of the sequestration and budget cuts, rather than a deliberate action by President Obama."}
