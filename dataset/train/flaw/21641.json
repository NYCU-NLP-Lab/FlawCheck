{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of voter turnout on election outcomes by stating that \"we win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low.\" The expert's verdict suggests that the evidence supporting this claim is relatively thin.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a lack of unified data on 2016 Democratic primary turnout rates, making it difficult to fully support the claim. They had to create their own measurements to analyze the turnout, indicating a lack of sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between voter turnout and winning elections. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption may be problematic and oversimplified, as there are other factors at play in determining election outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict points out that while Sanders won some high-turnout states, he also won low-turnout states and caucuses. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for his victories beyond just high voter turnout.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sanders has won some low-turnout contests, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. This indicates that the claim may not accurately represent the full picture of Sanders' electoral success.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the relationship between voter turnout and election outcomes, as suggested by the expert's verdict. However, it is not explicitly mentioned as a bias."}
