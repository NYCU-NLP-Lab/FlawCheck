{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of water sent to downstream rice farmers by stating that it equaled about three years' worth of Austin's water use.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the comparison between the water sent to rice farmers and Austin's water use.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sending water to downstream rice farmers had a negative impact on the water availability for Austin-area residents during a drought.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reduction in lake levels in 2011, such as natural factors or other water usage in the area."}
