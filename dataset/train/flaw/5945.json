{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the FBI reported to the Department of Justice during the Nixon Watergate investigation. The expert's verdict mentions that the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice \"out of courtesy,\" but it is unclear if this was the only reason or if there were other official procedures in place.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that there was \"nothing official\" requiring the FBI to report to the Department of Justice during the Watergate investigation. The expert's verdict mentions that the FBI reporting to the Department of Justice was standard operating procedure, and the organization chart of the Department of Justice shows that the FBI answers to the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there was no official requirement for the FBI to report to the Department of Justice during the Watergate investigation. However, the expert's verdict suggests that there were norms and procedures in place for the FBI to report to the Department of Justice, and the president's assertion of \"nothing official\" is contradicted by the historic record.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice during the Nixon Watergate investigation. It only mentions \"courtesy\" as a reason, but there may have been other factors or official requirements that influenced this decision."}
