{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the voting machine issues by suggesting that they occurred in heavily GOP areas, leaving some voters unable to cast ballots. The expert's verdict states that the problems were isolated and temporary, with no evidence that ballots were not counted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that voting machines didn't work in heavily GOP areas. The expert's verdict mentions isolated instances of temporary machine breakdowns, some reported secondhand, but no widespread issues.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the problems with voting machines disadvantaged Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, implying that it may have affected the election outcome. However, the expert's verdict states that the Democrats won both races, suggesting that the assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the reported problems with voting machines, such as isolated scanner jams and the use of backup scanners. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the issues raised in the claim."}
