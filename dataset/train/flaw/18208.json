{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Daniel Craig gets free Aston Martin cars for life. The expert's verdict mentions that the rumor is based on a single quote from 2008, and there is no official confirmation from the company.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Daniel Craig has a good relationship with Aston Martin and has been seen driving their cars on screen, he receives free cars for life. However, this assumption is not explicitly supported by any reliable sources.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Daniel Craig does have a special relationship with Aston Martin and gets to drive their cars as long as he continues to play James Bond. The CEO of Aston Martin confirmed that the movie Spectre would feature the iconic spy driving an Aston Martin DB10.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Daniel Craig actually purchased an Aston Martin V12 Vantage Roadster on his 45th birthday, rather than relying on the supposed lifetime of free cars.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that Daniel Craig has a partnership or sponsorship deal with Aston Martin, allowing him access to their cars for promotional purposes or during the filming of James Bond movies."}
