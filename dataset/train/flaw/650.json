{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the percentage of the American public who say they will not vote for Senator Clinton. The claim states that \"there are 50 percent of the American public that say they're not going to vote for her,\" which may be an overstatement or an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that 50 percent of the American public will not vote for Senator Clinton. It is mentioned that a Zogby International survey and a Harris Poll had similar results, but this may not be sufficient to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Senator Clinton's electability is solely determined by the percentage of the American public who say they will not vote for her. It does not consider other factors that may influence electability, such as her base of support or potential matchups against other candidates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the percentage of the American public who say they will not vote for Senator Clinton. It does not explore reasons for this sentiment or whether it may change over time.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a comprehensive analysis of Senator Clinton's electability. It focuses solely on the negative perception of her by some segments of the electorate without considering other factors or perspectives.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the level of polarization and negative opinions towards Senator Clinton. It mentions that Gallup polling consistently showed a negative opinion of her since 2000, but it does not delve into the extent or impact of this polarization.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any established facts, but it does not provide enough evidence or support to fully substantiate the statement made."}
