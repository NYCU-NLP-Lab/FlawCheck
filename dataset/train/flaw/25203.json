{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands and wants to sell deer to the highest bidder. This may be an exaggeration as there is no concrete evidence or public indication from James Kroll (the consultant hired by Walker) that he advocates for such actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim made by Barrett's campaign does not provide sufficient evidence or backup to support the assertion that Walker wants to privatize state lands or sell deer to the highest bidder.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hiring James Kroll as a consultant for deer management improvements implies a plan to privatize state lands and sell deer. This assumption may not be valid as there is no direct connection between the consultant's recommendations and these actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for hiring James Kroll as a consultant, such as seeking expert advice on deer management, rather than a deliberate plan to privatize state lands or sell deer.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that hunting on public land has been a part of Wisconsin's deer hunting tradition, and a significant number of deer are taken on public land. It implies that Walker wants to take away this right, which goes against the established practice.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on chain emails, internet rumors, and back-and-forth arguments between the two sides without presenting concrete evidence or a clear basis for the accusations made against Walker."}
