{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the health care law's employer mandate by stating that it only affects about 1 percent of the American workforce. This could be an understatement if the actual number of affected workers is higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that only about 1 percent of the American workforce is affected by the employer mandate. It relies on estimates and statements from sources without providing concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that most larger companies already offer insurance, therefore minimizing the impact of the employer mandate. This assumption may not hold true in all cases and could be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may affect the number of workers affected by the employer mandate. It presents a simplified view without exploring other potential factors."}
