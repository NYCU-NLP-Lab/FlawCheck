{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that a President Trump supporter kicked a Muslim woman in the stomach and killed her unborn twins. The expert's verdict clarifies that the suspect's political affiliations are not known, and the incident did not involve the killing of unborn twins.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it presents a sensationalized version of the incident without providing any evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the attacker is a President Trump supporter, which is not confirmed or supported by the available information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the suspect was a non-U.S. citizen, and the photograph circulated with the claim was unrelated to the incident."}
