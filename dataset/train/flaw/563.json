{"Understates": "The claim of \"500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare\" is an understatement because the actual number of approved applicants who picked an insurance plan is 106,185.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the number of sign-ups.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that signing up for a private insurance plan or being deemed eligible for Medicaid means signing up for Obamacare, which may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of sign-ups, such as people signing up for insurance plans outside of the Obamacare marketplace.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the early returns of sign-ups were considered underwhelming by many, including Democrats.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear information about who actually purchased coverage and how many successfully navigated through the website.", "Exaggerates": "The claim may exaggerate the success of Obamacare by presenting the number of sign-ups without considering the complexities and challenges of the law."}
