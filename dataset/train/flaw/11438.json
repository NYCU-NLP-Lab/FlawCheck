{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or proof that Robby Mook deleted most of his tweets due to an FBI investigation. The Gateway Pundit article does not provide any evidence or specific examples of the tweets that were allegedly deleted.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Robby Mook joined Twitter in April 2015 but didn't post anything until October 26, 2016. The lack of activity on his account was not due to a cover-up but simply because he doesn't use the service very often.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Robby Mook deleting his tweets by implying it was due to an FBI investigation. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it is likely an exaggeration or fabrication.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a disreputable source, the Gateway Pundit, which deleted their article shortly after publication. This suggests that the article may have lacked credibility or factual evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deletion of tweets by Robby Mook is directly linked to an FBI investigation into Clinton's campaign servers. However, there is no evidence or logical reasoning provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the lack of activity on Robby Mook's Twitter account, stating that he simply doesn't use the service very often. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the deletion of tweets was due to an FBI investigation."}
