{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Islamic prayer in Delhi's tableau at the Republic Day parade is a deliberate act to promote a particular religious group.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that only Islamic prayer was played during Delhi's tableau. The provided evidence only mentions the presence of the Islamic prayer call in the background.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the inclusion of Islamic prayer in Delhi's tableau, such as cultural diversity or historical significance.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by focusing solely on the presence of Islamic prayer without considering other elements of the tableau.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by relying on misleadingly edited video footage without providing the full context of the event.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the full video of the floats representing Indian states at the Republic Day parade shows the inclusion of prayers from different religions, not just Islamic prayer.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the presence of Islamic prayer by implying that it is the sole focus of Delhi's tableau and that it sends a specific message to non-Muslims."}
