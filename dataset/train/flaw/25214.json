{"Understate": "The claim may understate the involvement of Joshua Kushner's company, Oscar, in COVID-19 testing. The expert's verdict clarifies that Oscar created a website that screens users for testing eligibility and provides a list of testing sites nearby. However, it does not directly participate in the actual testing process or manufacturing of tests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to establish a direct financial interest of Jared Kushner's family in promoting specific tests. While the expert's verdict mentions that Jared Kushner has had a financial interest in Oscar in the past, it does not provide clear evidence linking this interest to promoting specific tests for financial gain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the Kushner family is trying to cash in on the pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that rumors have emerged suggesting financial interests in promoting specific tests, but it does not provide conclusive evidence to support the assumption of profiteering by the Kushner family.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the involvement of Joshua Kushner's company in COVID-19 testing. The expert's verdict highlights that Oscar's testing center locator is accessible to the general public and aims to provide information about testing centers. This suggests a potential alternative explanation focused on providing a helpful resource during the pandemic rather than solely financial gain.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that Joshua Kushner's company, Oscar, is not directly involved in the actual testing or manufacturing of COVID-19 tests. The expert's verdict clarifies that Oscar's role is limited to providing a website to screen users for testing eligibility and locate testing centers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the involvement of Joshua Kushner's company in COVID-19 testing. The expert's verdict states that Oscar's role is limited to creating a website for testing center location, but the claim implies a broader involvement in testing.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information. The provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the claim."}
