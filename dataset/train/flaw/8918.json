{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Floridians who could lose their health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ending the Affordable Care Act would result in the loss of health care coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Rick Scott and Florida Republicans want to take away health care coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Rick Scott's stance on the Affordable Care Act, such as his previous advocacy for repealing the law while still rhetorically supporting protections for pre-existing conditions."}
