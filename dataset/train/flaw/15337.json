{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of attacks on embassies and consulates during the George W. Bush period. The expert's verdict reveals that there were actually 39 attacks or attempted attacks, not 13 as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of deaths during the George W. Bush period. The expert's verdict states that 20 attacks resulted in at least one fatality, which is higher than the claimed 60 deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the numbers mentioned. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, relies on the Global Terrorism Database and cross-references with other sources to provide a more accurate count.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the attacks during the George W. Bush period were not investigated, while the expert's verdict mentions that there were investigations and testimonies conducted regarding these incidents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the attacks on embassies and consulates during the George W. Bush period. The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive analysis by considering attacks that occurred outside official compounds and including them in the count."}
