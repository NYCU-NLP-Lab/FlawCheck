{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data from the Vera Institute of Justice, which was initially used to support the claim, had problems and was compromised. This suggests that there may not be enough reliable data to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Sen. Amy Klobuchar assumes that the decrease in incarceration of African-Americans during her tenure as county attorney was a result of her actions. However, it does not provide evidence or specific actions taken by Klobuchar to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the data from the Vera Institute of Justice showed a decline in African-American incarceration on Klobuchar's watch, but the scale of the decrease was smaller. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in incarceration, such as broader changes in criminal justice policies or external factors unrelated to Klobuchar's actions.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the initial data used to support the claim was later found to have problems. This suggests that the claim may have faltered in terms of relying on accurate and reliable data.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the initial data used to support the claim was found to be compromised and unreliable. This contradicts the claim's assertion that there was a 65 percent decrease in incarceration of African-Americans during Klobuchar's tenure.", "Understate": "There is no evidence in the expert's verdict to suggest that the claim understates any information or facts."}
