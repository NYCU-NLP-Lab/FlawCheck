{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of people in Wisconsin with pre-existing conditions by using the figure of 2.4 million, which is higher than the estimate provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation of 852,000.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Leah Vukmir's stance on pre-existing conditions by stating that she supports letting insurance companies \"deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\" The expert's verdict mentions that Vukmir has not specifically said that insurers should be able to deny coverage and has expressed support for covering people with pre-existing conditions, albeit with vague details.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Vukmir's support for Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act implies support for allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. However, the expert's verdict notes that Vukmir's stance on how coverage for pre-existing conditions would be ensured is unclear.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Vukmir's support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, such as disagreements with other aspects of the law or a desire for alternative healthcare solutions."}
