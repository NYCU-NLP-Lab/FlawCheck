{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Obama's policies by stating that they have led to a 19% increase in unemployment, the loss of 37,900 manufacturing jobs, and an increase of 189,000 people in poverty.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim provides statistics to support its claims, it does not provide additional evidence or context to fully support the causal relationship between President Obama's policies and the stated outcomes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of the stated negative outcomes (unemployment increase, manufacturing job loss, increase in poverty) are solely attributable to President Obama's policies, without considering other factors that may have contributed to these outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the stated outcomes, such as the impact of the global economic recession during President Obama's tenure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pennsylvania's unemployment rate has actually decreased by 8% since its peak, rather than continuously increasing as stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the complex factors that contribute to unemployment, manufacturing job loss, and poverty rates, leading to an oversimplification of the issue."}
