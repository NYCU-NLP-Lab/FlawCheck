{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of the Texas budget that funds services to non-U.S. citizens. The expert's verdict mentions that the statement should have said \"up to 25 percent\" and that the exact figure is not known.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the specific percentage mentioned. The expert's verdict mentions that the state costs of providing services to illegal immigrants are not known and that there is uncertainty around the percentage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all taxpayer-funded services going to non-citizens make up over 25 percent of the state budget. The expert's verdict mentions that the percentage includes all costs, including costs to local governments, and that it may not be accurate to say it's 25 percent of every state dollar.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative factors that could contribute to the estimate, such as the higher cost of educating non-English proficient students. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the state costs mentioned in the claim."}
