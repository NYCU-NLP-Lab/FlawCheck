{"Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a study conducted in 2008 by the Guttmacher Institute. The data used to support the claim is outdated, and there is uncertainty about whether the estimate remains relevant due to changes in abortion rates since then.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prevalence of abortions remains constant and that the 2008 data is still accurate. However, there is evidence to suggest that abortion rates have decreased since 2008, which could make the claim outdated and inaccurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in abortion rates since 2008. Factors such as improved access to contraception, changes in societal attitudes towards abortion, or other demographic shifts could contribute to the decline in abortion rates.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual number of women who have had abortions by the age of 45, as it is based on data from 2008 and does not account for potential changes in abortion rates over time.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that abortion rates have decreased since 2008, according to the Guttmacher Institute's own data. This raises questions about the accuracy and relevance of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its accuracy and relevance due to the outdated data used to support it and the uncertainty surrounding the current abortion rates."}
