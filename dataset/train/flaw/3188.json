{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the exhibit by describing it as a mere part of a revamp, while the expert's verdict highlights its symbolic character and connection to the upcoming election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the exhibit was intended to reflect expectations of the election, whereas the expert's verdict mentions Reuters as the first to report on the exhibit and provide some context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the exhibit was intended to criticize or oppose President Trump, but there is no direct evidence or statement from the museum suggesting this. The expert's verdict mentions that the museum described the removal of the wax figure as a preparatory measure without explicitly mentioning opposition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the exhibit, such as it being purely for promotional or attention-grabbing purposes. The expert's verdict mentions that the museum updated the Trump exhibit in the past to reflect current events, suggesting a broader intention beyond political commentary.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the portrayal of the exhibit by stating that the Trump wax figure was \"thrown away\" in the trash, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it was placed in a dumpster as part of the exhibit revamp."}
