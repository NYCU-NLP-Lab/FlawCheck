{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides two national surveys to support the statement that a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality. The sample size of Catholics in the surveys is also relatively small, leading to higher margins of error.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the views of Catholics on marriage equality are uniform and monolithic, disregarding the potential diversity of opinions within the Catholic community.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the poll results, such as the influence of demographics or specific religious beliefs within the Catholic population that may affect their views on marriage equality.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all Catholics favor marriage equality, as indicated by the survey results provided. While a majority may support it, there is still a significant percentage that opposes it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in presenting a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the survey results. It selectively focuses on the surveys that support the claim while disregarding the potential impact of factors like the option of civil unions on the level of support for marriage equality among Catholics.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the level of opposition to marriage equality among Catholics by not providing a complete picture of the survey results or considering other relevant factors.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim."}
