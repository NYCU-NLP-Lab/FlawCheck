{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact and scope of the Arizona immigration law. The expert's verdict mentions that the law makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of suspicious persons or risk being sued. However, the claim does not accurately represent the full extent of the law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Arizona law does not permit racial profiling. However, the expert's verdict mentions that critics of the law have bristled over Scott's portrayal of it as a \"common-sense\" law enforcement approach, and PolitiFact has already examined the racial profiling aspect of the law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that the Arizona law allows law enforcement officers to ask individuals about their legal status if they have a suspicion that they are illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict provides the actual wording of the law, but the claim does not reference any specific sections or provisions to back up its statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or interpretations of the Arizona law. It presents a one-sided view of the law, without acknowledging any potential concerns or criticisms.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's verdict by stating that the Arizona law allows law enforcement officers to ask individuals about their legal status if they have a suspicion that they are illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions that the law requires a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of a person if there is reasonable suspicion that they are unlawfully present in the United States, but it does not explicitly state that officers can ask individuals about their legal status."}
