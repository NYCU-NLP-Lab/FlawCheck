{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of annexation on overcrowding at Decatur's city schools. The expert's verdict mentions that Decatur's annexation plan was designed to accommodate a school system already growing at an unprecedented rate, and that student enrollment would grow by about 550 students by 2020 even without annexation. This suggests that annexation could potentially exacerbate the issue of overcrowding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that annexation would lead to overcrowding at Decatur's city schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the joint letter from the city and school district in November stated that student enrollment would grow by about 550 students by 2020, but it does not provide further evidence or analysis to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may be based on a problematic assumption that annexation would necessarily lead to overcrowding at Decatur's city schools. The expert's verdict mentions that Decatur's proposal drew vigorous opposition from residents in the neighborhoods surrounding shopping plazas, who argued that the city would get the tax dollars but avoid taking more students into its school system. This suggests that there may be alternative perspectives or factors to consider that could challenge the assumption that annexation would lead to overcrowding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for overcrowding at Decatur's city schools. The expert's verdict mentions that the growth in student enrollment in Decatur occurred when the city's last major annexation brought in just 75 homes and 14 students from the Parkwood neighborhood. This suggests that factors other than annexation, such as generational turnover in single-family homes, may be contributing to the growth in student population.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any specific facts mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the potential impact of annexation on overcrowding at Decatur's city schools.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at times as it consistently asserts that annexation would lead to overcrowding at Decatur's city schools."}
