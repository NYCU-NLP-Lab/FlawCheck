{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Hillary Clinton is not the only one who turned over emails. The claim implies that she is the only one who complied with the State Department's request, but the information provided states that two out of the four former secretaries did not turn over any emails because they did not use email much during their time at the State Department.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that Hillary Clinton is the only one who turned over emails. The information provided only mentions that she turned over 55,000 pages of emails, but it does not provide any information about the actions of the other former secretaries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that turning over emails is the only measure of compliance with the State Department's request. It does not consider other possible ways in which former secretaries may have complied with the request, such as using official government email accounts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the other former secretaries may not have had personal emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts to turn over, as they did not use email much during their time at the State Department."}
