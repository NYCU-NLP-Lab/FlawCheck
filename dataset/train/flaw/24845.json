{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of voter registration applications put on hold by stating it as 53,000, when the expert's verdict presents it as \"nearly 70 percent\" of the applications.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high percentage of African American voter registration applications being put on hold is evidence of voter suppression, without providing sufficient evidence or alternative explanations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation of voter suppression, as it does not provide additional data or context to substantiate the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the policies overseen by Brian Kemp, such as the \"exact match\" registration verification process, have drawn criticism and legal challenges. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the high number of voter registration applications put on hold, such as administrative processes or adherence to specific regulations."}
