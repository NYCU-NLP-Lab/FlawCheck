{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Taco Cabana restaurants have banned Donald Trump supporters, when in reality, the sign found at one restaurant was not an official policy of the Taco Cabana restaurant chain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that Taco Cabana restaurants have banned Donald Trump supporters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the sign found at one Taco Cabana restaurant reflects the policy of the entire restaurant chain, which is not the case according to the Taco Cabana CEO.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the sign, such as it being a prank or a hoax, as confirmed by Taco Cabana and other Mexican restaurants in the San Antonio area."}
