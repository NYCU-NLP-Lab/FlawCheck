{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it suggests that crime will significantly increase if football is taken away, without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no empirical evidence or research provided to back up the assertion that crime will increase if football is removed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that there is a direct correlation between the absence of football and an increase in crime, without considering other factors that may contribute to crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for changes in crime rates, such as changes in socio-economic conditions, policing strategies, or other societal factors that may influence crime independent of football."}
