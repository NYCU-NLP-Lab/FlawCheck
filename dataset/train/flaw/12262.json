{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the video circulating on social media predates the current events and there is nothing that locates or dates the video in the tweet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows a Nigerian soldier shooting at #EndSARS protesters, but there is no concrete evidence or confirmation of this.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the video by linking it to the ongoing protests and suggesting it as evidence of the alleged shootings.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information, such as the video being published in May 2020 but also being linked to the Lekki tollgate shooting in October 2020.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video predates the current events and therefore cannot be directly linked to the ongoing protests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the video, such as it being unrelated to the protests or depicting a different incident altogether."}
