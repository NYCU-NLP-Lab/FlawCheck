{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which land has been taken back from ISIS since the election. While the claim states that \"almost 100 percent\" of the land has been retaken, the expert's verdict clarifies that it is actually around 98 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately attributing the entirety of the land recaptured to the period since the election. The expert's verdict highlights that approximately 50 percent of the territory was reclaimed in the 11 months leading up to the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to fully substantiate the assertion that all the land recaptured from ISIS took place since the election. The expert's verdict provides evidence that significant progress was made prior to the election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the land taken back from ISIS can be attributed solely to the actions of the current administration since the election. The expert's verdict indicates that progress against ISIS was already underway before the election.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the recapture of land from ISIS. The expert's verdict suggests that the progress made against ISIS is the result of a collective effort by coalition forces, rather than solely the actions of the current administration."}
