{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that Jill Stein exaggerated the extent of projected sea level rise by claiming that it would be \"not one yard but many yards\" in as soon as 50 years. The scientific consensus suggests a more realistic rise of 0.33 to 1.33 yards by 2100.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Stein cherry-picked the findings of a disputed study to support her claim. This suggests that there may not be enough support for her claim in the scientific community.", "Problematic assumption": "Stein's claim assumes that global warming will directly cause sea levels to rise by a significant amount within a short period of time. The expert's verdict states that the scientific consensus predicts a smaller rise over a longer period.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts Stein's claim by stating that the scientific consensus predicts a rise of 0.33 to 1.33 yards by 2100, while Stein claims it would be \"not one yard but many yards\" in 50 years.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict suggests that Stein's claim may be an understatement of the projected sea level rise, as the scientific consensus predicts a rise of 0.33 to 1.33 yards by 2100, while Stein claims it would be \"not one yard but many yards\" in 50 years.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Stein has previously exaggerated the extent of projected global sea level rise, suggesting that her claim may falter in terms of accuracy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program project a much smaller rise over a longer period than the study cited by Stein. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the projected sea level rise."}
