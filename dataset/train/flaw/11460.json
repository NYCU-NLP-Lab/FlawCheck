{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the accomplishment of wiping out a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes, as there are alternative explanations and a different accounting method that could be considered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wiping out the deficit without raising taxes is solely attributed to the actions of Gov. Scott Walker, without considering other factors or contributions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that the deficit was completely eliminated without raising taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the deficit may not have been completely eliminated, as Walker's own administration recently reported a deficit at the end of the budget period."}
