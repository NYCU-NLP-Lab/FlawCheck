{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the bushfires on the koala population by stating that they are \"functionally extinct,\" which is deemed inaccurate by experts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the destruction of koala habitat by bushfires is the sole reason for their potential extinction, without considering other factors such as food degradation, deforestation, hunting, drought, and fires over the years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that koalas are \"functionally extinct\" due to the bushfires.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the koala population is still present in the wild and can effectively reproduce, as stated by experts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the decline in koala population, such as food degradation, deforestation, hunting, drought, and fires, which are not solely attributed to the bushfires."}
