{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential increase in funding for education by stating that Georgia can substantially increase its funding by going after $2.5 billion in uncollected taxes. The actual amount that can be collected and allocated to education is unclear.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that going after uncollected taxes will result in a substantial increase in funding for education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all $2.5 billion in uncollected taxes can be successfully collected and used for education funding, without considering the challenges and limitations of collecting such a large amount.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute raises doubts about the viability of the plan, suggesting that not all individuals or businesses have the means to pay their taxes, and that intentional tax dodgers may not fully comply even if caught. This alternative explanation questions the effectiveness of going after uncollected taxes as a solution for increasing education funding."}
