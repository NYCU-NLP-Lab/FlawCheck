{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Dominion Voting Systems by stating that it deleted votes for Donald Trump and switched votes to Joe Biden.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by conservative news sources and an unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research, but there is no concrete evidence provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Dominion Voting Systems was responsible for deleting votes and switching votes, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The coalition of security groups, including the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Association of State Election Directors, concluded that there is no evidence of any voting system deleting or changing votes, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the claim."}
