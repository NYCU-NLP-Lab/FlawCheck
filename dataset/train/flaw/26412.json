{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that Senator Jeff Sessions exaggerated the length of time since the previous low point in the employment-to-population ratio.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement about the lowest percentage of Americans holding a job in 40 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between the number of jobs available and the percentage of Americans holding a job, without considering other factors that may affect employment rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim may be referring to a different statistic, the labor force participation rate, which is a common talking point for Republicans. This implies that there could be alternative explanations for the low percentage of Americans holding a job."}
