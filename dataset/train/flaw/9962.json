{"Understate": "The claim states that Melania Trump's one-day stay at the hotel in Cairo cost the U.S. government $95,050. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Melania Trump did not stay overnight at the hotel, suggesting that the actual cost may be lower than stated.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the services provided by the hotel may not have been rendered while Melania Trump was actually in Cairo. This raises questions about the accuracy and support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the entire cost of $95,050 was solely attributed to Melania Trump's stay at the hotel, without considering other possible expenses or services provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the services charged by the hotel may have been provided to staff engaged in planning the First Lady's visit and Secret Service personnel making security arrangements. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the cost was solely for Melania Trump's stay.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that Melania Trump's one-day stay at the hotel in Cairo cost the U.S. government $95,050, while the expert's verdict confirms that she did not stay overnight at the hotel. This contradiction undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an incomplete and potentially misleading representation of the actual expenses incurred during Melania Trump's visit to Cairo.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the cost by attributing the entire $95,050 to Melania Trump's one-day stay, even though the expert's verdict suggests that the services provided may have been for other purposes as well."}
