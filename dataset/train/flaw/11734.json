{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of testing being conducted on airlines and trains. The expert's verdict states that the CDC is not testing passengers for COVID-19 as they get on or off airplanes and trains.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the CDC is not testing passengers at airports or train stations, as confirmed by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual screening measures being implemented, as it implies that testing is being conducted on a widespread basis when it is not. The expert's verdict clarifies that screening for symptoms is being done at 13 airports for international flights, but it is not the same as testing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that testing passengers at airports and train stations is a practical and effective measure, without considering the limitations of slow delivery of test results and limited availability for people with symptoms, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about strong tests being conducted on airlines and trains. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides information from the CDC and other sources to refute the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have an alternative explanation, suggesting that the statement made by Trump may have been referring to screening of passengers rather than actual testing, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
