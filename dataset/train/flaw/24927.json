{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video shows Trump attending an interfaith prayer service at a church in Washington, DC, after his inauguration as US president in 2017. The claim falsely states that it shows a Koran recitation in a US Senate meeting.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the event by stating that it is the first time in history that the US President and Senate opened a meeting with the Koran.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or credible sources to back up the assertion that the White House asked for an imam/Islamic scholar to pray in order to be kept away from the corona outbreak.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of a Koran recitation at an interfaith prayer service indicates that the White House acknowledges Islam as a true religion and seeks guidance to Islam.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the video shows Trump and Pence attending a National Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral, which is an inaugural tradition.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting misleading information and misinterpretation of the video, leading to a false conclusion about a Koran recitation in a US Senate meeting.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the provided claim."}
