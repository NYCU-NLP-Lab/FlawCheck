{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the threat posed by the malicious video by stating that it will hack the phone in 10 seconds and cannot be stopped in any way. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is misleading and a hoax.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a Facebook post and a poster issued by Pakistan's National Information Technology Board (NITB). However, the expert's verdict reveals that the NITB removed its warning about the hoax message, and the same misleading warning message has circulated in multiple countries. This lack of consistent and reliable support undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a specific video titled \"Argentina\" circulating on WhatsApp is malicious and will hack the phone. However, the expert's verdict states that the warning message has been identified as fake by Nigeria's National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). This suggests that the assumption made in the claim is problematic and not based on accurate information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the warning message was dismissed as a hoax by multiple agencies and that similar warnings have circulated in different countries. This indicates that there are alternative explanations for the claim, such as it being a misinformation campaign or a prank rather than a genuine threat."}
