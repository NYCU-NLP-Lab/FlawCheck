{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates North Carolina's ranking in overdose deaths by stating that it was second in the nation, while data shows it was actually 19th in drug overdose death rate and 10th in total number of overdose deaths.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cracking down on people who distribute drugs will effectively reduce opioid overdose deaths, without providing evidence or considering alternative approaches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in overdose deaths, such as the role of prescription painkillers and street drugs, and the impact of other factors like socioeconomic conditions or access to healthcare."}
