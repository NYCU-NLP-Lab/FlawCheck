{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Ohio's electricity rates are below the national average. The expert's analysis shows that the difference is actually around 8 percent, not 10 percent as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Ohio's electricity rates are 10 percent below the national average. The expert's analysis indicates that the figures relied upon by the governor's campaign staff are not complete or up-to-date.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ohio's lower electricity rates are solely attributable to the governor's energy reform efforts, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the rates being below the national average.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the lower electricity rates in Ohio may have been influenced by market-based pricing regulations implemented through Senate Bill 221, rather than solely the governor's efforts. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's attribution of the lower rates solely to the governor's actions.", "Falters at times": "The claim is not accurate in terms of the current figures, as Ohio's electricity rates are around 8 percent below the national average, not 10 percent as claimed. This inconsistency weakens the claim's reliability.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the extent to which Ohio's electricity rates are below the national average. The expert's analysis shows that in 2009, the difference was 11 percent, not the 10 percent claimed by the governor.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Ohio's electricity rates are currently around 8 percent below the national average, not 10 percent as claimed. The expert's analysis provides evidence to support this contradiction."}
