{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation of electoral fraud by the BJP. The video provided does not directly prove electoral fraud and is misleadingly presented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the storage of electronic voting machines in the video is evidence of electoral fraud committed by the BJP. However, there is no clear connection between the storage of the machines and fraudulent activities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video footage is from a November 2018 incident in Khurai, Madhya Pradesh, and not a recent incident during the upcoming elections. The claim falsely presents old footage as breaking news.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the video by presenting it as evidence of electoral fraud committed by the ruling party. The video itself does not provide substantial evidence to support such a claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on misleading information and presenting it as breaking news. It fails to provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding the alleged electoral fraud.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the storage of electronic voting machines in the video, such as routine transportation or maintenance procedures. The claim does not consider other possible reasons for the presence of the machines in the vehicles."}
