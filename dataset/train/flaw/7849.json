{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the Supreme Court did not actually strike down the Wisconsin photo ID election law, but rather temporarily blocked its implementation.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by using terms like \"struck down\" to describe the impact of the Wisconsin ruling, when in fact it was more accurately described as \"blocked\" or \"stayed\" by most media outlets, legal observers, and participants in the case.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively state that the Supreme Court struck down the Wisconsin photo ID election law, as it only mentions separate judicial rulings in Wisconsin and Texas that gave cheer to opponents of state laws requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the brief Supreme Court order striking down the Texas statute also applies to the Wisconsin law, without providing sufficient evidence or clarification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that the Supreme Court struck down the Wisconsin photo ID election law, as the court's action was temporary and did not address the merits of the law's constitutionality."}
