{"Exaggerate": "The claim of Sweden having the highest rate of rape among European countries is exaggerated, as statistical evidence shows that reported cases of rape have remained steady for almost a decade.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the influx of refugees in 2015 is directly linked to the rise in rape in Sweden, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Sweden has the highest rate of rape among European countries, as the provided evidence contradicts this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the rise in reported rape cases in Sweden, such as changes in the definition of rape and increased reporting rates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that reported cases of rape in Sweden dropped from 2014 to 2015, rather than spiking suddenly after the influx of refugees in 2015.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual increase in reported rapes in 2016, as preliminary statistics show a 13 percent rise over 2015.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information, such as using a graph of \"sexual crimes\" instead of specifically focusing on rape, which is the claim being made."}
