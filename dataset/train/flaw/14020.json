{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the connection between Hillary Clinton's tax returns and shadowy connections to donors of the Clinton Foundation and State Department beneficiaries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the income from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term is evidence of shadowy connections or pay-to-play politics, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the income, such as the consulting work done by Bill Clinton for educational businesses with ties to the Clinton Foundation, which may not have directly profited from the State Department."}
