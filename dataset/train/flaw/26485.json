{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or statistics to support the idea that using thyroid guards during x-ray procedures can prevent thyroid cancer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in thyroid cancer could be related to the use of dental x-rays and mammograms, without providing any scientific evidence or studies to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider other factors that could contribute to the increase in thyroid cancer, such as changes in diagnostic techniques, environmental factors, or genetic predisposition.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that dental x-rays and mammograms are important diagnostic tools that can detect and prevent various health conditions, including thyroid cancer.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of discussing the use of thyroid guards with healthcare professionals, as it suggests that patients should simply request them without providing information on their effectiveness or potential risks.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on anecdotal evidence from a TV show and personal experiences, rather than scientific research or expert opinions.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the role of thyroid guards in preventing thyroid cancer, as it presents them as a solution without considering other preventive measures or factors contributing to the disease."}
