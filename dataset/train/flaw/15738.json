{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which illegal immigration is not getting worse, as it is based on apprehension rates which may not accurately reflect the actual number of illegal immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a single graph of apprehension rates, which may not provide enough evidence to support the conclusion that illegal immigration is not getting worse.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that apprehension rates are a reliable indicator of the overall trend of illegal immigration, which some experts argue may not be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in apprehension rates, such as the possibility that illegal immigrants are getting better at avoiding detection rather than there being fewer attempts to cross the border."}
