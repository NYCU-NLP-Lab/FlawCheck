However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption may be problematic, as the focus of the agreement may be on other aspects such as diplomatic relations and easing restrictions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of commitment to political parties or a transition to democracy in the U.S. agreement. The expert's verdict mentions that the focus of the agreement may be on other issues, such as democratic reforms, and that the United States may not have gained enough in the deal."}
