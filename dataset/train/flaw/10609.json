{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that \"almost 6,000 state jobs\" are being lost, while the analysis indicates a reduction of 5,727 full-time-equivalent positions (FTEs) by 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about losing 6,000 state jobs. It only refers to an analysis of the adopted budget by the Legislative Budget Board, which mentions a reduction of 5,727 FTEs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the reduction of FTEs equates to the loss of state jobs. However, the state auditor's office clarifies that FTE positions may not necessarily be equivalent to a headcount, and the actual number of jobs being cut could be greater than 5,727.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction of FTEs, such as the possibility of employers trimming their workforces by eliminating unfilled positions or using attrition and retirement incentives instead of layoffs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it uses \"full-time-equivalent positions\" as a shorthand for jobs, even though it's not a perfect fit. This could lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the actual number of jobs being cut.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the impact of the budget cuts by only mentioning the loss of state jobs in Austin. It does not provide information on potential job losses in other parts of Texas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or evidence provided in the expert's verdict."}
