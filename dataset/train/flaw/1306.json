{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence or support for the claim that the text outlines a process by which the U.S. Vice President and Republicans in Congress can subvert the counting of electoral votes.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the claim is based on misinformation and that it is part of the ongoing post-election misinformation. However, this assumption may not be proven or supported by evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that successfully mounting challenges to electoral ballots is difficult and rarely done, suggesting that the claim may be exaggerating the ease of subverting the counting of electoral votes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by attributing the claim to Jenna Ellis, a lawyer who represented President Donald Trump during his attempts to overturn the general election results. This suggests that the claim may be biased or influenced by political motivations."}
