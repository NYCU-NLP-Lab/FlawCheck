{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate the claim that the Supreme Court has ordered a case to be filed against PM Modi over the Rafale deal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Supreme Court has made a specific verdict ordering a case against PM Modi, but there is no evidence or official statement from the court to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the article it refers to does not mention anything about the apex court ordering a case against PM Modi. The article only states that the hearing was deferred and that PM Modi has been made a party in the case.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the news by using terms like \"Big verdict\" and \"Rafale scam\" without providing any concrete evidence or official statement.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the lack of credibility of the source, True Report, and the Facebook page, Bhakto Ka Baap Ravish Kumar, which have been associated with spreading fake news and deleting articles with fake content.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation or create controversy without any factual basis."}
