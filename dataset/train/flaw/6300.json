{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single photo without any additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the soldiers in the photo are discarding their uniforms in defiance of the Myanmar military coup, which may not be the case.", "Contradict fact": "The photo actually shows soldiers abandoning their uniforms during a failed coup attempt in Turkey in 2016, not in Myanmar.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo is unrelated to the Myanmar military coup and is being misused to support a false narrative."}
