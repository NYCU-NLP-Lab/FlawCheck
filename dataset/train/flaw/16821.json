{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the law by stating that public schools, colleges, and state-funded day care centers will be made into sanctuaries. The expert's verdict clarifies that the law defines state and local police officers' roles in immigration matters, and it focuses on public safety and civil rights.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the signing of SB 31 will turn public schools, colleges, and state-funded day care centers into sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants. However, the expert's verdict explains that the law does not explicitly state this, and it primarily addresses law enforcement's mission and federal prerogatives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or support for the assertion that public schools, colleges, and state-funded day care centers will become sanctuaries. The expert's verdict provides more context and information about the law but does not confirm or refute the claim directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents one interpretation of the law, suggesting that it will create sanctuaries. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there are opposing viewpoints and concerns about the law's impact on public safety."}
