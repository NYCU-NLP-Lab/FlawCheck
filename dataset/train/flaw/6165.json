{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Trump never said that Mexico would pay for the border wall, when in fact he made multiple statements during his campaign indicating that Mexico would contribute to the cost.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or examples to back up the assertion that President Trump never said Mexico would \"write out a check\" to pay for the wall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by assuming that the only way Mexico could contribute to the cost of the wall is by writing a check, when there were other proposed methods such as remittance payments and increased visa fees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that President Trump did make statements during his campaign about Mexico paying for the wall through various means, as outlined in his campaign position paper and speeches.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Trump did make statements during his campaign indicating that Mexico would contribute financially to the construction of the wall.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a consistent and accurate representation of President Trump's statements and proposals regarding Mexico paying for the wall.", "Understate": "The claim understates the extent of President Trump's statements and proposals about Mexico paying for the wall, as it only focuses on the specific phrase of \"writing out a check\" and ignores the broader context of his campaign promises."}
