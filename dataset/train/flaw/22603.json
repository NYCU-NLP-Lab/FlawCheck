{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the Proud Boys disparaged Donald Trump. While there were individuals within the group who expressed negative views, it is not clear if this sentiment was widespread among all members.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Proud Boys disparaged Trump. The evidence provided is based on posts in Proud Boy-linked channels on Telegram, but it is unclear if these posts represent the views of the majority of the group or if they are representative of any \"official\" stance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the views expressed in the Proud Boy-linked channels on Telegram accurately reflect the overall sentiment of the group. However, it is possible that these channels attract a specific subset of individuals within the group who hold more negative views towards Trump.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the negative views expressed towards Trump by some members of the Proud Boys. It primarily attributes this sentiment to Trump's lack of support following the Capitol riot, but there may be other factors influencing these views that are not explored.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in presenting a clear and comprehensive picture of the Proud Boys' views towards Trump. It provides snippets of comments and statements without providing a broader context or analysis of the overall sentiment within the group.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support and loyalty that some members of the Proud Boys still had towards Trump. While there were individuals who expressed negative views, there may have been others who remained supportive or did not share the same level of criticism.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any established facts. It is based on reported comments and statements made in Proud Boy-linked channels on Telegram, which have been documented by various news outlets."}
