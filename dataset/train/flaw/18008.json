This lack of supporting evidence weakens the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Michael Jordan's opinion is an authoritative and definitive judgment on who the greatest basketball player of all time is. However, this assumption may not be valid as the concept of the \"greatest\" player is subjective and varies among individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the quote attributed to Michael Jordan is fabricated and there is no evidence to support its authenticity. This alternative explanation undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that the quote attributed to Michael Jordan is not genuine and that no credible news outlet or article reported it. This contradicts the claim that Michael Jordan said LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time.", "Exaggerate": "The claim presents Michael Jordan's supposed statement as settling the debate of the greatest basketball player of all time \"once and for all.\" This exaggeration implies that the statement holds ultimate authority and disregards other perspectives and opinions."}
