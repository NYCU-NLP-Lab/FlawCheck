{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in Nigeria, stating that 45 million people could die, which is an overestimation based on available data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the global mortality rate for COVID-19 was not 0.2 percent a month ago, as claimed, but was actually 2.93 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that 45 million Nigerians will die from COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nigeria lacks the financial reserves to purchase new protective gear, but data from the Central Bank of Nigeria shows that the country had $35.9 billion in reserves as of March 19, 2020.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that Nigeria is waiting for the World Bank to release money, implying that the government has misused state funds. However, there may be alternative explanations for the delay in purchasing protective gear that are not explored in the claim."}
