{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in food stamp spending under both President Bush and President Obama. The expert's verdict states that food stamp spending doubled under both presidents, but the claim implies that it doubled twice under each president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that food stamp spending doubled under President Bush and doubled again under President Obama. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the U.S. Agriculture Department, but it does not provide any additional sources or data to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the doubling of food stamp spending under both presidents is a negative outcome. However, it does not provide any context or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the recession played a role in the increase in food stamp benefits before President Bush left office. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the doubling of food stamp spending under both presidents, such as economic factors beyond their control."}
