{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for vote by mail by stating that \"80% of the people\" want this option, while the expert's verdict mentions that the poll cited by Sen. Amy Klobuchar found 78% support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the claim that \"80% of the people\" want vote by mail. The expert's verdict mentions that the poll cited by Klobuchar was conducted by a liberal group, and while other national polls show majority support for voting by mail, they do not reach the same level of support as the poll cited.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of people want the option of vote by mail without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative viewpoints. The expert's verdict mentions that while there is majority support for voting by mail, it may not be as high as the claim suggests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are alternative explanations, such as different phrasing of questions in polls conducted by different groups, which can lead to varying levels of support for vote by mail. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the level of support found in different polls."}
