Rick Scott defrauded taxpayers at every HCA location.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Rick Scott is guilty of defrauding taxpayers without presenting substantial evidence or considering alternative explanations for the actions taken during his tenure as CEO of Columbia/HCA.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions of Gov. Rick Scott during his time as CEO of Columbia/HCA, such as the possibility that any fraud may have been conducted by individuals within the organization rather than directly by Scott himself."}
