{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that black babies die at rates twice as high as white babies due to a lack of access to affordable health care. While the statistics provided by the CDC do show a higher mortality rate for black infants, it does not explicitly state that this is solely due to a lack of access to affordable health care. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the role of health care access in the disparity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the higher mortality rate for black babies is solely due to a lack of access to affordable health care. It does not present any studies, research, or expert opinions to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the disparity in infant mortality rates between black and white babies is primarily caused by a lack of access to affordable health care. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are other factors involved, and it is not a simple cause-and-effect relationship. This assumption may oversimplify the complex issue of infant mortality disparities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that numerous academic studies and media investigations have highlighted correlations between access to health care and the disparity in infant and maternal mortality rates between black and white mothers. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the higher mortality rates among black babies, such as socioeconomic factors, systemic racism, and healthcare disparities."}
