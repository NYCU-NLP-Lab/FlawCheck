{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal lacks enough support as the expert mentions that while there are some Democrats who support the project, the majority of vocal support comes from Republicans. The expert also mentions that the support of one Democrat or one Republican does not make a proposal bipartisan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption. The expert's verdict indicates that there is debate and disagreement among Democrats and Republicans regarding the project.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the support or opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The expert's verdict mentions that environmentalists are opposed to the project while labor's AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position. This suggests that there are various factors influencing the support or opposition to the pipeline, which the claim does not acknowledge."}
