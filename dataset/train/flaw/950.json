{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that cooks helpers moved into DMV jobs they were not trained for. The expert's verdict mentions that the Republican candidate for governor, John Robitaille, failed to provide any evidence to back up his claim, and when the expert conducted their own investigation, they found only three former cook's helpers currently working at the DMV, none of whom were in customer service roles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that union rules are the sole reason for cooks helpers moving into DMV jobs they were not trained for. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence or a comprehensive analysis of the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation at the DMV by attributing the problem solely to union rules and the hiring of untrained cooks helpers. The expert's verdict suggests that there are multiple factors contributing to the issues at the DMV, such as branch closures and antiquated computing systems.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and well-supported argument. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of evidence and inconsistency in the statements made by John Robitaille, the source of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of former cook's helpers in DMV jobs. The expert's verdict does not explore other possible reasons for their employment, such as relevant skills or qualifications acquired after their initial positions as cook's helpers."}
