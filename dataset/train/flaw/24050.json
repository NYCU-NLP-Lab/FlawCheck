{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Gov. Tony Evers \"removed the American flag from the Capitol building\" without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the provided picture as proof is from a rally in support of reopening Wisconsin, which does not directly prove that Evers ordered the flag to be taken down.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Evers ordered the flag to be removed based on a photo from a rally, without considering alternative explanations or further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the flagpole in question is controlled by the state Assembly, and they only fly the U.S. flag when in session, which was not the case during the rally.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and not providing a clear timeline or context for the events mentioned.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Evers has ordered the Capitol to fly the rainbow pride flag and the Juneteenth flag, which shows that he has not removed the American flag permanently.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the provided claim."}
