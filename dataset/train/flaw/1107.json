{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in potency between the marijuana smoked by kids today and the marijuana smoked by Jeb Bush 40 years ago. The claim implies that there is a significant difference in potency, but it does not provide specific data or evidence to support this exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that the marijuana smoked by kids today is different from the marijuana smoked by Jeb Bush 40 years ago. It relies on a statement made by Carly Fiorina, but there is no additional information or research provided to back up this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any potential differences in marijuana potency. It assumes that the only factor contributing to the difference in potency is the passage of time, without considering other factors such as cultivation methods, genetic modifications, or changes in processing techniques.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average potency of marijuana has indeed increased over the years, as shown by the University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project's analysis of confiscated marijuana samples. The claim implies that there is no difference in potency, while the evidence suggests otherwise.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and concise argument or evidence to support its assertion. It relies on a quote from Carly Fiorina and does not offer any additional analysis or supporting information."}
