{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Jared Kushner deleted all of his tweets after the tax story broke lacks support as there is evidence from archived versions of his Twitter profile that he had no tweets on his account for many years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kushner did not delete tweets after the news broke about Trump's tax history.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of tweets on Kushner's account, as it only mentions that he hasn't posted tweets since 2016, but fails to highlight that he has never posted any tweets at all.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kushner deleting his tweets would be a significant action or indication of guilt, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of tweets on Kushner's account, such as him simply not being an active Twitter user or him using a different account for posting tweets."}
