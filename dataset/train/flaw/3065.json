{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Scott Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood by stating that it \"left women across the state stranded with nowhere else to turn\" for cancer screenings, breast exams, and birth control. This is because the claim fails to acknowledge that alternative providers were available, although they may have been farther away for some women.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the impact of Scott Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood by not fully acknowledging that women in certain parts of the state, particularly those with lower incomes, did lose their local healthcare provider and had to travel farther for services. The claim also fails to mention that Planned Parenthood shut down five facilities as a result of the funding cut.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that women were \"left stranded with nowhere else to turn.\" While it is mentioned that women were referred to other providers, it is not clear how accessible or convenient these alternative providers were for all women affected by the defunding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Scott Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood may have been motivated by reasons other than leaving women without access to healthcare services. The claim does not explore the possibility that Walker may have redirected funding to other organizations to provide similar services.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Planned Parenthood was the only trusted and familiar healthcare provider for women affected by the defunding. However, this may not be the case for all women, as they may have had relationships with other healthcare providers in their communities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Scott Walker's statement that he transferred money from Planned Parenthood to other organizations, suggesting that the defunding resulted in a complete loss of access to healthcare services. However, the claim fails to acknowledge this alternative perspective.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not fully addressing the nuances and complexities of the impact of Scott Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood. It presents a one-sided view without acknowledging the alternative perspectives or the partial availability of alternative providers."}
