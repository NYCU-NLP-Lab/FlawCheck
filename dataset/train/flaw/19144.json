{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of taxpayer money given to Solyndra by stating it as \"half a billion,\" when in reality it was around $535 million.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the White House knew Solyndra was on the path to bankruptcy. The expert's verdict states that the loan program office believed due diligence for the Solyndra loan would be complete by March 2009, indicating that they did not have prior knowledge of Solyndra's financial troubles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that President Obama gave taxpayer money to \"his friends\" at Solyndra. The expert's verdict mentions that wealthy donors with ties to Solyndra gave money to Obama, but there is no direct evidence provided to prove a quid pro quo relationship.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loan given to Solyndra was solely motivated by political ties and not based on the merits of the company's technology or potential economic benefits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the loan given to Solyndra, such as the potential support for renewable energy and job creation."}
