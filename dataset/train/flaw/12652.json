{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that Vice President Mike Pence unfollowed the president and changed his Twitter banner to an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a change in Twitter behavior by Mike Pence indicates a break-up or distancing from President Trump, which may not necessarily be true.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that both Pence's @VP account and his individual account still follow @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump, indicating that he has not unfollowed the president.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the Capitol attack and the subsequent condemnation of the unrest by Pence, as it focuses primarily on the Twitter behavior rather than the broader context.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the actions and statements of both Pence and Trump, as well as the overall situation surrounding their relationship during and after the Capitol attack.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for any changes in Pence's Twitter behavior, such as a temporary banner change for a specific event or a technical glitch.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact or significance of Pence's Twitter behavior by suggesting it represents a significant rupture or break-up between him and President Trump."}
