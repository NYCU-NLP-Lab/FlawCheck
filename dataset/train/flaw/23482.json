{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific data or evidence to support the statement that the number of inmates dying of natural causes on death row has surpassed the number of inmates executed. Without sufficient evidence, the claim lacks support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of inmates dying of natural causes on death row is a significant issue or a problem that needs to be addressed. However, it does not provide any context or justification for why this is a concern or why it should be compared to the number of inmates executed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide any alternative explanations for the increase in the number of inmates dying of natural causes on death row. It assumes that this increase is solely due to delays and inefficiencies in the judicial system, without considering other factors such as changes in sentencing practices or the aging population on death row.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexity of criminal cases and the challenges involved in conducting state post-conviction reviews. It simplifies the issue by attributing the delays solely to the judicial system, without acknowledging other factors that may contribute to the lengthy process.", "Contradict fact": "Without specific data or evidence, it is difficult to determine if the claim contradicts any factual information. However, if there is evidence available that shows the number of inmates executed is still higher than the number dying of natural causes, then the claim would contradict that fact.", "Exaggerate": "Without sufficient evidence, it is hard to determine if the claim exaggerates the situation. However, if the claim is not supported by data or if the difference between the number of inmates dying of natural causes and the number executed is minimal, then the claim may be considered an exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication that the claim falters at times, as it is a single statement without any additional context or information provided."}
