{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that Debbie Wasserman Schultz \"denied unemployment went up under Obama,\" while the evidence suggests that she actually argued that unemployment had dropped and was continuing to drop.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the unemployment rate did increase under Obama, as stated in the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Wasserman Schultz denied the increase in unemployment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Wasserman Schultz deliberately tried to deceive Americans, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Wasserman Schultz was referring to the recent decrease in unemployment and not the overall trend during Obama's presidency."}
