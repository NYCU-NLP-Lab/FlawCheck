{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Gov. Perry relied on federal help to balance the budget. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Perry did receive federal aid, but it does not specify the exact amount or the proportion of the budget that it represented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gov. Perry started blaming members of Congress who offered the federal help. The expert's verdict mentions that Perry had a history of criticizing Washington and opposing spending, but it does not provide direct evidence of him blaming specific members of Congress for offering the help.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Perry's acceptance of federal help and his subsequent criticism of Congress are contradictory or hypocritical. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough information to determine the validity of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. Perry's actions, such as political strategy or ideological differences. The expert's verdict mentions Perry's history of anti-Washington rhetoric and opposition to spending, which could be alternative explanations for his criticism of Congress."}
