{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of reported instances of children born alive after an abortion in Texas by stating that there have been \"zero\" reported instances. The data provided only covers the years 2013 to 2016, and there may be unreported instances or instances that occurred outside of this time frame.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on data available through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which tracks abortion statistics. However, the data provided only includes information about complications during abortion procedures and does not specifically identify cases of infants born alive after attempted abortions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lack of reported instances of children born alive after an abortion in Texas. The data provided only includes complications during abortion procedures performed on Texas residents, and it does not account for complications that may have occurred out of state or for non-residents of Texas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of reported instances of children born alive after an abortion in Texas means that it never happens. However, the data provided only covers a specific time frame and may not capture all instances or accurately reflect the entire population.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the rarity of cases of infants born alive after attempted abortions by stating that they are \"exceedingly rare.\" This statement is made by Dr. Karen Swenson, representing the Texas District of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and may not accurately reflect the actual frequency of such cases.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive picture of the situation. The data provided is limited to a specific time frame and does not include detailed information about individual cases or complications. Additionally, the claim focuses on reported cases within the state of Texas and does not delve deeper into the data on complications that occurred out of state."}
