{"Exaggerate": "The claim of the minority graduation rate going \"from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%\" may be an exaggeration based on the provided data, as the graduation rates for black and Hispanic students in Beloit were not consistently below those of Milwaukee and Madison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support from the provided data, as it only includes graduation rates for three school years in Beloit and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with Milwaukee and Madison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the improvement in graduation rates during Holtz's tenure as Beloit school superintendent was solely due to his attention to safety and discipline, without considering other potential factors or interventions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the improvement in graduation rates, such as changes in curriculum, teaching methods, or community involvement, which are not addressed in the claim."}
