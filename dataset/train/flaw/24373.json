{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the statement made by FBI Director James Comey by stating that Hillary Clinton \"had no knowledge\" of the classified emails. Comey actually stated that there was evidence that Clinton knew she was receiving classified information, but could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt in court.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Comey did not say that Clinton had no knowledge of the classified emails. He acknowledged that there was evidence that she knew, but could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton had no knowledge of the classified emails because they were either not marked, not classified at the time, or incorrectly marked. However, this assumption is not supported by Comey's statements, as he stated that there was evidence that she knew she was receiving classified information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for its assertion that Clinton had no knowledge of the classified emails. It does not provide any evidence or further explanation to support this claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the evidence presented by Comey, as he stated that there was evidence that Clinton knew she was receiving classified information. The claim does not acknowledge this evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the classified emails on Clinton's private server. It assumes that Clinton had no knowledge of them, but there could be other explanations for their presence."}
