{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Trump supporters \"trashed everything in sight\" at the rally. While the photographs show some trash and debris left behind, it is unclear if it was truly excessive or if it was representative of all Trump supporters in attendance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Trump supporters had \"trashed everything in sight.\" The evidence provided only includes photographs and reports of trash left behind, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison to other events.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the trash and debris seen in the photographs were left by Trump supporters. It does not consider the possibility of other individuals or factors contributing to the mess.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of trash and debris, such as inadequate clean-up efforts by the convention center or other logistical issues. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
