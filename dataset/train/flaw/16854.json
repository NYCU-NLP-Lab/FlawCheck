{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"1 in 100 people are sociopaths\" lacks enough support as it is based on a statement made by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul without providing any specific evidence or research to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the prevalence of sociopaths is accurately represented by the statistic provided by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, without considering alternative explanations or differing diagnostic criteria used by experts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or differing diagnostic criteria used by experts, such as the American Psychiatric Association's use of the term \"antisocial personality disorder\" instead of \"sociopath.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by the American Psychiatric Association, which states that the prevalence of antisocial personality disorder (a similar concept to sociopathy) has been found to range from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent, not 1 in 100.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the prevalence of sociopaths by using a statistic that is higher than the range provided by the American Psychiatric Association for antisocial personality disorder.", "Exaggerate": "Although the claim itself does not necessarily exaggerate the prevalence of sociopaths, it relies on a statement made by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul without providing additional evidence or context, which could lead to an exaggerated perception of sociopathy in the general population.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not clearly distinguishing between the terms \"sociopath,\" \"psychopath,\" and \"antisocial personality disorder,\" and by relying on a statement that may not align with expert opinions or research."}
