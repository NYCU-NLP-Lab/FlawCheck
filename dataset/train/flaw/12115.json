{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in average teacher's pay by stating it as \"more than 15 percent\" when the actual increase is 10.8 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in average teacher's pay is solely attributed to Republican legislators in North Carolina, ignoring the role of other factors or parties.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average teacher's pay has not risen 15 percent in the span of three years, but rather about half that amount in six years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by selectively focusing on a specific period (the most recent three years) and ignoring other budgets and years where teacher pay fell or remained stagnant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the increase in average teacher's pay, as it is mentioned that some of the raises were due to a previous fact check on Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, indicating that factors beyond Republican legislators may have contributed to the increase.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the increase in average teacher's pay by not acknowledging that it is still a substantial raise, even if it is not as high as claimed."}
