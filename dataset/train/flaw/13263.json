{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the social media post was actually depicting the Cajun Navy's efforts during Hurricane Harvey, not Hurricane Dorian.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that volunteers were headed to Florida to help with Hurricane Dorian relief, when in reality, the photograph and text were from two years earlier and depicted the Cajun Navy's efforts in Texas during Hurricane Harvey.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or verification for the photograph and text depicting volunteers heading to Florida for Hurricane Dorian relief.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph and text accurately represent the situation during Hurricane Dorian, without verifying the authenticity or source of the information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the photograph and text were from a previous hurricane (Harvey) and not related to Hurricane Dorian."}
