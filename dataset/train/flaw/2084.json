{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sen. Rod Monroe did not have any support for his claim when asked about it, and the Injury Center scientists could not confirm the statistic either.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being killed by a spouse or domestic partner is the second leading cause of death for women under 50, without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that intimate partner violence falls under the category of homicide, which ranks sixth in the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 1 and 50. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as other forms of homicide or causes of death."}
