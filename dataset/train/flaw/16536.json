{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of oil and gas spills in 2012 by stating that there were 6,000 spills, when in fact the expert's verdict mentions that there were \"more than 6,000 reported spills 'and other mishaps'\" at onshore oil and gas sites.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific source or data to back up the claim about the number of spills in 2012. However, the expert's verdict mentions a July 2013 investigation by EnergyWire that supports the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it includes a reference to the Elk River chemical storage facility leak in West Virginia, which is not directly related to onshore oil and gas production sites. This weakens the claim's argument about the number of spills in the oil and gas industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spills mentioned in the expert's verdict are all related to onshore oil and gas production sites, when in fact the spills mentioned include various types of toxic spills, not just spills of crude oil.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the spills mentioned, but the expert's verdict mentions that the spills were mostly 100-gallon leaks that could be contained and cleaned up in a day. This suggests that the spills may not have had significant environmental impacts."}
