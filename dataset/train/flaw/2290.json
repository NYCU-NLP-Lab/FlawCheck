{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential increase in costs under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal. The expert's verdict mentions that Tim Ryan, a Democrat, argues that the value of the proposed vouchers would not keep pace with healthcare costs, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that the average person will pay $6,000 more a year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that the average person will pay $6,000 more a year under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average person will experience a significant increase in costs under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal aims to balance the federal budget and reduce government costs for Medicare.

Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal includes a \"premium support payment\" that future retirees could use to purchase private insurance. The claim implies that the proposal would result in higher costs for the average person, while the proposal itself suggests a different approach to funding and coverage.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any aspect related to Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing sufficient evidence or data to support its assertion about the average person paying $6,000 more a year under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal."}
