{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Dallas has fewer police officer-related shootings than any large city in America. The available data from different sources varies, and there is no comprehensive and conclusive data to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of police officer-related shootings is the sole measure of a city's safety or effectiveness in managing law enforcement. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to public safety or the overall performance of the police department.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the low number of police officer-related shootings in Dallas. Factors such as different policing strategies, community engagement initiatives, or variations in crime rates could contribute to the lower number of incidents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were actually two police-related shootings by Dallas police in 2016, not just one as stated by the expert. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of police officer-related shootings in Dallas by only considering incidents involving Dallas Police Department officers and not including shootings by non-Dallas police officers that occurred in Dallas.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the significance of Dallas having fewer police officer-related shootings than any large city in America. The available data is limited and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with all large cities in the country.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times due to discrepancies between different data sources and the inclusion/exclusion of certain incidents. This inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
