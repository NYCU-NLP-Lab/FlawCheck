{"Exaggerate": "The claim \"Bernie Sanders wins California landslide, But \u2154 of his votes aren\u2019t counted\" exaggerates the extent of Sanders' victory by using the term \"landslide\" when the official results show Clinton with a significant lead.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only references the Justice Gazette article and does not provide any additional evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Sanders won by a landslide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the uncounted votes would heavily favor Sanders without providing evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the gap between Sanders and Clinton closed steadily as more votes were tallied, indicating that the final result was a reflection of the overall voting pattern in the state."}
