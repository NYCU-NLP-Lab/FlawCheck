{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of cases the judge heard during her tenure as a Wisconsin appeals court judge. The campaign initially provided an unimpressive explanation for the number in the ad, and the campaign consultant later came up with a different figure based on extrapolation from one year of case termination statistics.", "Lack enough support": "The campaign could not provide a record of how many opinions the judge wrote or orders she issued. Instead, they attributed to her a caseload figure that any of the five judges in District 4 would have had if cases were distributed equally among them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of cases heard is a critical factor in evaluating the judge's qualifications for the Supreme Court. However, the number of cases heard does not necessarily reflect the quality or impact of the judge's decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the judge being assigned a higher number of cases due to specific circumstances or factors not mentioned in the provided information."}
