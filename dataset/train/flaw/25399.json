{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the nature of the jewelry being made from unwanted human embryos. While the claim states that jewelry is being made directly from the embryos, the expert's verdict clarifies that the jewelry is actually made from the ashes of unused embryos.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that a jewelry company is making jewelry out of unwanted human embryos. The expert's verdict provides information about an Australian jeweler offering jewelry embedded with ashes of unused embryos, but it does not mention any specific company making jewelry directly from embryos.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the jewelry made from unused embryos is unwanted. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any information to support or refute this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the existence of the jewelry made from unused embryos. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, explains that the jewelry is made as a keepsake for parents who have undergone in-vitro fertilization procedures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the jewelry is made from the ashes of unused embryos, not directly from the embryos themselves. The expert's verdict clarifies this discrepancy.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at any specific point, as it simply states that a jewelry company is making jewelry out of unwanted human embryos. The expert's verdict, however, provides additional context and corrects misconceptions surrounding the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information, as it presents the statement that a jewelry company is making jewelry out of unwanted human embryos. The expert's verdict, however, provides more nuanced information about the jewelry being made from the ashes of unused embryos."}
