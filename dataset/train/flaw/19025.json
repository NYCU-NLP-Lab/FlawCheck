{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that a man was lynched in front of Arvind Kejriwal, when in reality, the video shows a scuffle and does not provide evidence of a lynching.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the incident by suggesting that Arvind Kejriwal remained a mute spectator without intervening, while the video does not clearly show his actions or lack thereof.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that a lynching occurred in front of Arvind Kejriwal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Arvind Kejriwal's lack of intervention in the video implies his approval or indifference towards the alleged incident, without considering other possible reasons for his actions or lack thereof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the scuffle shown in the video, such as a disagreement or altercation unrelated to the claim of lynching."}
