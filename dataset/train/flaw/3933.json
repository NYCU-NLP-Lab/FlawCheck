{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the assertion that Amber Alerts are issued for white kids \"but not Black kids in Milwaukee.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim by stating that nearly half of the alerts issued since 2003 in Wisconsin were for Black children, and every one of Milwaukee police's 11 alerts was for a Black child.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the racial disparity in Amber Alerts between white and Black kids in Milwaukee is intentional and discriminatory. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Amber Alerts are issued for white kids but not Black kids in Milwaukee. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim by stating that nearly half of the alerts issued since 2003 in Wisconsin were for Black children, and every one of Milwaukee police's 11 alerts was for a Black child. However, the verdict does not provide comprehensive data on all Amber Alerts issued in Milwaukee.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the racial disparity in Amber Alerts between white and Black kids in Milwaukee. The expert's verdict mentions concerns in the Black community about police response time in missing child cases and references a specific incident where an Amber Alert was not issued because authorities did not believe the girls' lives were in danger.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying it to a racial disparity. The expert's verdict highlights the strict criteria that incidents must meet for an Amber Alert to be issued, which may contribute to the lower number of alerts overall.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that nearly half of the alerts issued since 2003 in Wisconsin were for Black children, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making a general reference to which children are the subjects of Amber Alerts without considering the specific criteria and circumstances that determine when an alert is issued. The expert's verdict highlights the strict criteria that incidents must meet for an Amber Alert to be issued."}
