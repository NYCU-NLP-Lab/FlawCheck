{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Patrick Morrisey \"refused to support Trump over Hillary\" when in fact he did support Trump in the general election against Hillary Clinton.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the accusation that Morrisey refused to support Trump over Hillary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that not supporting Trump automatically means supporting Hillary, which is not necessarily true.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Morrisey voted for Trump at the Republican National Convention and in the Electoral College.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Morrisey may have had reservations about Trump initially but still supported him in the general election based on his stance against Hillary Clinton.", "Understate": "The claim understates Morrisey's support for Trump by not acknowledging his vote for Trump at the Republican National Convention and in the Electoral College.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting Morrisey's statements and intentions, as he did not explicitly refuse to support the Republican candidate who gets the most votes in West Virginia."}
