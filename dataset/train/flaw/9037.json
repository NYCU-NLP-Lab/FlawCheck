{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Withheld union dues fund half of Dem (Democratic) campaigns in Florida\" lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The expert mentions that they reached out to Grover Norquist and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, but did not receive a response or specific information on this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all withheld union dues are used to fund Democratic campaigns in Florida, which may not be accurate. The expert mentions that the National Institute on Money in State Politics separates campaign donations received by party and industry sectors, but there is no specific information provided about the exact proportion of union dues funding Democratic campaigns.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be an exaggeration by stating that half of Democratic campaigns in Florida are funded by withheld union dues. Without concrete evidence or data, it is difficult to determine the exact proportion of union dues funding political campaigns.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by the expert, who states that in 2010, Florida state candidates received a total of $332 million in contributions, with $89 million going to Democrats and $195 million going to Republicans. This suggests that union dues may not account for half of Democratic campaign funding.", "Understate": "There is no evidence or information provided to suggest that the claim is understating any aspect.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing concrete evidence or support for the assertion that withheld union dues fund half of Democratic campaigns in Florida.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert does not provide any alternative explanations for the claim, but it is possible that other sources of campaign funding contribute to Democratic campaigns in Florida."}
