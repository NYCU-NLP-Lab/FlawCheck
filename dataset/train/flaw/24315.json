{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of prisoners released by the Obama Administration from Guantanamo who have returned to the battlefield. While the claim states that 122 prisoners have returned, the expert's verdict clarifies that only nine of those transfers happened during the Obama administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the released prisoners have returned to the battlefield. The expert's verdict provides data from the Director of National Intelligence's report, which suggests that 122 detainees have re-engaged in terrorist activity, but it does not specify the nature or extent of their involvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the release of prisoners from Guantanamo is a \"terrible decision\" without providing any justification or evidence for this assumption. The expert's verdict does not address the claim's assumption directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim places the blame solely on the Obama Administration for the release of prisoners who returned to the battlefield. However, the expert's verdict points out that the majority of the detainees who fall into the total were actually released during the administration of President George W. Bush. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the prisoners' return to the battlefield."}
