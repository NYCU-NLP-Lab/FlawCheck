{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a prediction made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and does not provide any additional evidence or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obamacare will directly cause as many as 20 million Americans to lose their employer-based insurance, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not provide a clear timeline or context for when and how the 20 million Americans could potentially lose their insurance.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Congressional Budget Office and other independent groups project that the number of uninsured Americans will be significantly lower due to the implementation of Obamacare.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential positive impact of Obamacare on reducing the number of uninsured Americans, as it focuses solely on the potential loss of employer-based insurance without considering the overall increase in coverage."}
