{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the U.S. is giving seven Alaskan islands to Russia contradicts the fact that the islands have never been claimed by the United States and lie on the Russian side of the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post by a Texas congressional candidate and an e-rumor, both of which have been debunked by fact-checking organizations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the islands in question have always been on the Russian side of the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary, and the United States has never asserted a claim to them.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the U.S. is \"giving away\" the islands, when in fact, there has been no such action by the U.S. government.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the islands were \"given away\" in secret negotiations from which Alaska was excluded, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the historical context and the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary treaty signed by President George H.W. Bush, ratified by the U.S. Senate, and supported by Alaska's senators."}
