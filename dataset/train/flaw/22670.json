{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Mexico and Canada assemble cars with foreign parts and send them to the U.S. with no tax. The expert's verdict states that virtually all cars assembled in Mexico and Canada met the required threshold for tax-free status in 2017.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mexico and Canada assemble cars with foreign parts and send them to the U.S. with no tax, without considering the existing threshold of 62.5 percent for tax-free status.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Mexico and Canada assemble cars with foreign parts and send them to the U.S. with no tax.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is a threshold of 62.5 percent for regional value content in order to qualify for tax-free status under NAFTA.", "Understate": "The claim understates the existing requirements and thresholds for tax-free status under NAFTA, which include the percentage of auto parts from North America and the tariffs imposed on vehicles that do not meet the threshold.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the assembly of cars in Mexico and Canada, such as the use of U.S. content and the compliance with the new requirement of 75 percent auto parts threshold."}
