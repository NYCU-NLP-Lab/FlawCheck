{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by describing the sunset as \"remarkable\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this characterization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the photograph indeed shows a sunset over Moscow. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the image is a composite of multiple photographs and does not conclusively prove the location.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph depicts a sunset over Moscow without verifying the accuracy of this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the cloud portion of the image was taken from a different photograph and not captured in Moscow."}
