{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that there are currently more African American males in the penal system than there were enslaved at the height of slavery. This comparison may be seen as an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison being made. The expert's verdict mentions a book and a previous fact-check, but it is unclear if these sources provide enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct comparison between the number of African American males in the penal system today and the number of enslaved individuals during the height of slavery. This assumption may overlook the complexities and differences between the two historical contexts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the disparity in numbers between African American males in the penal system today and enslaved individuals during slavery. Factors such as changes in population size, legal systems, and societal structures may contribute to the difference.", "Contradict fact": "The claim seems to contradict the fact that the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery, except as a punishment for a crime. The comparison between the two periods may not be accurate due to this legal distinction.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its comparison due to the lack of specific data or evidence provided. The expert's verdict mentions focusing on the imprisoned-enslaved comparison, suggesting that the claim may not hold up under closer scrutiny."}
