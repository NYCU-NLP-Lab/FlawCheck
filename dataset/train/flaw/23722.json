{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential cost difference between a private rocket launch and a government-led one, stating that it would be \"40 or 50 times\" more expensive. The expert's verdict provides evidence to suggest that this estimate is an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a government-led rocket launch would cost significantly more than a private one. The expert's verdict provides information about the cost of private rockets and the shared costs between NASA and private companies, but no specific evidence is provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that private sector involvement always leads to better and cheaper outcomes compared to government-led initiatives. This assumption may not hold true in all cases and can be considered problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the cost difference between private and government-led rocket launches. It highlights the difference in scope and objectives, with private rockets focusing on low-Earth orbit while NASA's Space Launch System aims for more extensive missions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that private rockets, such as SpaceX's Falcon 9, have a list price of $62 million, which is significantly lower than the claim's estimate of \"40 or 50 times\" that amount.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear whether the claim falters at times, as there is no specific evidence or information provided to assess its accuracy or consistency."}
