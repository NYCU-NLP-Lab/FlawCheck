{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential fines for passengers using mobile devices in Canada. The expert's verdict states that no province has a $1,500 fine for distracted driving, which contradicts the claim's assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or examples to support the assertion that Canadians can be fined for passengers using mobile devices. The expert's verdict mentions that no province could provide an example of a driver being charged due to a passenger's device usage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Canadians can be fined for passengers using mobile devices, without considering the specific laws and regulations of each province. The expert's verdict highlights the variations in traffic rules and enforcement across different provinces in Canada.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claim, such as the possibility of a driver or passenger being fined if the passenger's cell phone usage impairs the driver's ability to drive safely. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that passengers using mobile devices can lead to fines."}
