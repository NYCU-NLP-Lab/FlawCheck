{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the condition of Wisconsin highways by stating that it is \"not only the worst, but it was worse by a gaping margin.\" This statement implies that Wisconsin highways are significantly worse than those in neighboring states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that Wisconsin highways are the worst among neighboring states. It only mentions that a Legislative Audit Bureau report rated the condition of Wisconsin highways as the worst, but does not provide further details or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the International Roughness Index (IRI) is the only valid measure to compare the condition of highways across states. While the IRI is a commonly used measurement, there may be other factors or metrics that could also be considered in evaluating the condition of highways.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or mention any potential alternative explanations for the condition of Wisconsin highways. It solely focuses on the rating given by the Legislative Audit Bureau report without considering other factors that could contribute to the condition of the highways."}
