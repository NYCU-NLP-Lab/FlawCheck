{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that President Erdogan refused to shake hands with President Macron. The provided evidence shows that there are images and videos of the two leaders shaking hands.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single image and misspells President Erdogan's name. The evidence provided contradicts the claim by showing multiple instances where the two leaders have shaken hands.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Erdogan's criticism of President Macron's remarks on Islam and his recommendation to boycott French goods directly translates to a refusal to shake hands. There is no direct evidence linking these events.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are images and videos available showing President Erdogan and President Macron shaking hands.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for President Erdogan's actions or body language in the specific image shared, which are not considered in the claim."}
