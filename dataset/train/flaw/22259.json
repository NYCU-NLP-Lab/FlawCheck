{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Harambe received 15,000 votes in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is not backed up by any actual data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the votes for Harambe were counted separately and tallied, which is not the case in the majority of states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have been a result of people casting write-in \"protest\" votes for Harambe as a form of criticism towards the main candidates.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of votes Harambe received, as it is not specified whether it was exactly 15,000 or potentially more.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that write-in votes for unofficial candidates like Harambe are not typically counted in most states.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Harambe's votes by suggesting that it played a significant role in the outcome of the election.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing concrete evidence or data to support the assertion of 15,000 votes for Harambe."}
