{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of votes recorded in Pennsylvania by stating that there were \"205,000 votes more than they had voters,\" when in reality, the discrepancy was 202,377 votes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that there were more votes recorded than voters. The provided evidence shows a discrepancy, but it does not prove that the extra votes were fraudulent or illegal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the discrepancy in votes automatically indicates election fraud. However, the expert's verdict states that state and federal judges have found no evidence of fraud or illegal voting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the discrepancy in votes could be attributed to incomplete data, as some counties had not completed uploading their vote histories. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of voter fraud.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the numbers obtained by Pennsylvania State Rep. Frank Ryan were based on incomplete data and not accurate. This contradicts the claim's assertion that there were more votes recorded than voters.", "Understate": "The claim understates the discrepancy by not mentioning the additional 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, which adds up to a total discrepancy of 170,830 votes."}
