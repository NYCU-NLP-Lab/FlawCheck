{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of taxpayer dollars allegedly sent by Obama to fund anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel. The actual amount is stated to be a little more than $349,000, not $350,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the funds were specifically used to support anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel for the election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funds provided to OneVoice were used to influence voters in Israel for the election, but it is stated that the money was spent before the elections were even scheduled.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for the funds, stating that they were used for town-hall style meetings on university campuses and to support the Knesset Caucus for the Two-State Solution.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the funds in influencing voters, as it is stated that the money was used for meetings and support for a two-state solution, rather than directly funding anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Payton Knopf, senior director of global communications for OneVoice, who denies that any U.S. government funds were spent in connection with the recent elections in Israel."}
