{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of tenured teachers in the last 10 years by stating there were 150,000, as the actual number is not supported by available records.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the number of tenured teachers in the last 10 years, as there are no official records available to verify the figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of dismissals for incompetence is extremely low (only 17) compared to the number of tenured teachers, but it does not consider other factors that could contribute to the low number, such as the difficulty of proving incompetence or the effectiveness of the tenure system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the low number of dismissals, such as the possibility that incompetence is not the primary reason for teacher dismissals, or that the tenure system effectively filters out incompetent teachers before they reach tenured status."}
