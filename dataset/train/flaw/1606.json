{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of FBI Director James Comey discussing details of a federal investigation close to an election. The expert's verdict mentions that former Justice Department officials from both the Clinton and Bush administrations have criticized the move as unprecedented, suggesting that the claim may not fully acknowledge the gravity of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that there are Justice Department policies against Comey discussing investigation details close to an election. While the expert's verdict mentions memos from past attorneys general, it does not provide direct evidence of such policies. Therefore, the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Comey discussing investigation details close to an election is against Justice Department policies. However, the expert's verdict only mentions memos about political activities and the avoidance of interfering with elections. It does not explicitly state that discussing investigation details close to an election is prohibited. Therefore, the claim may rely on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Comey's actions or the potential reasons behind the Justice Department policies. It presents the assumption that the policies exist solely to prevent interference in elections, but there could be other reasons for such policies. Therefore, the claim may overlook alternative explanations."}
