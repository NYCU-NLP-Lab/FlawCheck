{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 94 percent of Marco Rubio's constituents support a universal background check. The only evidence provided is a poll conducted by a group co-chaired by Michael Bloomberg, which may be seen as biased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for universal background checks among Floridians is representative of Marco Rubio's constituents. However, it is not explicitly stated whether the poll included only Rubio's constituents or a broader sample of Floridians.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the high levels of support for universal background checks found in the polls. It is possible that the wording of the question influenced the responses, or that respondents were not fully informed about the potential implications and challenges of implementing such a policy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that five Republican senators, including Marco Rubio, have stated their opposition to any new \"Second Amendment restrictions.\" This suggests that not all of Rubio's constituents support a universal background check.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the potential opposition to universal background checks by focusing only on the high levels of support found in the polls and not acknowledging the existence of opposing viewpoints.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of support for universal background checks by using the specific figure of 94 percent without acknowledging the margin of error in the poll results.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting statements from Marco Rubio himself. In one interview, he appears open to universal background checks, while his spokesman later clarifies that he does not support expanding background checks to private sales."}
