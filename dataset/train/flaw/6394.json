{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting data to prove that the president of the United States already has the legal authority to reduce the price of many commonly used prescription drugs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legal mechanisms mentioned by Senator Elizabeth Warren can effectively bring down drug prices without waiting for Congress, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear explanation of how the legal mechanisms can be used to reduce drug prices and whether they would be applicable to all drugs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that the president has the legal authority to reduce drug prices, there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the legal mechanisms mentioned that could challenge this assertion."}
