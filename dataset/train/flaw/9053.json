{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton refuse to declare war on ISIS is contradicted by the fact that both of them have asked Congress to authorize military force against ISIS.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Obama and Clinton by suggesting that they have completely refused to declare war on ISIS, when in reality they have taken significant military action against the terrorist group.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that Obama and Clinton refuse to declare war on ISIS.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that declaring war on ISIS is the only way to effectively combat the terrorist group, which may be a problematic assumption as there are various strategies and approaches to address the threat.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Obama and Clinton have taken significant military action against ISIS but have not formally declared war, instead relying on existing authorization and legislation."}
