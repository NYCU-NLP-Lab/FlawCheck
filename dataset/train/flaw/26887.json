{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"Medicare has at least $80 billion worth of fraud a year. That's a full 20 percent of every dollar that's spent on Medicare goes to fraud.\" However, the expert's verdict suggests that the $80 billion estimate is not supported by concrete evidence and that the scale of the problem is difficult to measure precisely.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that statistics offered to document the scale of Medicare fraud are slippery and vary widely. This suggests that the claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to back up the $80 billion estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Medicare is \"designed to be defrauded,\" which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict does not directly address this assumption but highlights the difficulty in measuring the extent of fraud in Medicare.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the $80 billion estimate. It states that the $60 billion figure covers fraud in all U.S. health care expenditures, not just in Medicare, suggesting that the claim may be off in its estimate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim asserts that \"a full 20 percent of every dollar that's spent on Medicare goes to fraud.\" However, the expert's verdict suggests that the $80 billion estimate is not supported by evidence and may not accurately represent the proportion of fraud in Medicare spending.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim understates the extent of fraud in Medicare. The focus is more on the overstatement of the $80 billion estimate.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its estimation of the scale of Medicare fraud, as the expert's verdict suggests that the $80 billion estimate is not well-supported."}
