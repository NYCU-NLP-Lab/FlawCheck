{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in the percentage of officers fired or who chose to resign during Lori Lightfoot's tenure as president of the police board. The claim states that the percentage \"roughly doubled,\" which implies a significant increase, but it does not provide specific numbers or percentages to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that the percentage of fired officers or officers who chose to resign doubled during Lightfoot's tenure. It only provides a graphic included in a tweet, which does not provide sufficient information to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the percentage of fired officers or officers who chose to resign is solely due to Lightfoot's leadership and reforms. It does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the changes in disciplinary outcomes during that time period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in the percentage of fired officers or officers who chose to resign during Lightfoot's tenure. Factors such as changes in department policies, increased public scrutiny, or other external influences could have also played a role in the observed changes."}
