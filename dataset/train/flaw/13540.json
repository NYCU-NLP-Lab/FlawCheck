{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of support for the Jerusalem Embassy Act by stating that it passed Congress by an \"overwhelming bipartisan majority\" without specifying the exact numbers or percentage of support.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact and controversy surrounding the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It does not mention the longstanding dispute between Israelis and Palestinians over the status of Jerusalem or the concerns that moving the embassy could destabilize peace talks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the passage of the Jerusalem Embassy Act and its reaffirmation by the Senate indicate widespread support for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. However, it does not consider alternative viewpoints or the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that the Jerusalem Embassy Act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority or was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate. It lacks enough support to verify the accuracy of these claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why past U.S. presidents from both parties have regularly signed waivers to suspend the move of the embassy, such as concerns about peace negotiations or international relations."}
