{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks concrete proof, such as copies of the \"doll\" letters themselves, to substantiate its core claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the story of Kafka consoling a little girl by writing letters as her missing doll is true, despite the lack of concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the story may be a fictionalized account or a literary invention rather than a factual event in Kafka's life."}
