{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Mayor Muriel Bowser by stating that she ordered all hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and convenience stores to close specifically to discourage Trump supporters from gathering in D.C. This is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or official statement provided to directly link the closure of these establishments to discouraging Trump supporters from gathering in D.C.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and convenience stores is solely aimed at discouraging Trump supporters from gathering in D.C., which is a problematic assumption as there could be other reasons for these closures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the closure of these establishments is related to the surge of COVID-19 cases in the city, as stated by Mayor Bowser."}
