The expert's verdict mentions conflicting reports and confusion, making it difficult to determine the exact nature of the denial.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the denial of the request by the Department of Defense was intentional and related to the pro-Trump mob seeking to prevent the certification of the presidential election.
