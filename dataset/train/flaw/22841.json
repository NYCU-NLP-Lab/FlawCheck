{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the CBC cutting a scene featuring Donald Trump from the broadcast of \"Home Alone 2\" by attributing it to political reasons.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CBC's decision to cut the scene was politically motivated, without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the CBC cut the scene for political reasons. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the scene was cut for time, not political bias.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the scene was cut in 2014, long before Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign, suggesting that it was not politically motivated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict offers an alternative explanation for the scene being cut, stating that it was a common practice to edit movies for television broadcasts, removing scenes that are not suitable or to make room for commercials."}
