{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the extent to which Scott Walker was able to expand the school choice program in Milwaukee, stating that he could only secure a 500-student increase, when in fact the program expanded to more than 25 municipalities under his leadership.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between Scott Walker's school choice program in Wisconsin and Mitch Daniels' voucher program in Indiana.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of expansion in the Milwaukee voucher program was solely due to Scott Walker's inability to garner support from his own party, without considering other factors that may have influenced the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the possibility that there may be alternative reasons for the difference in growth between the voucher programs in Wisconsin and Indiana, such as differing political dynamics or educational policies."}
