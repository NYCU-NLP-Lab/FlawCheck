{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Gov. Scott Walker's role in leading people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn't implement a health-care exchange, Obamacare doesn't happen there. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is about the past and points to several statements made by Walker, but it doesn't provide enough evidence to support the extent of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Gov. Scott Walker led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn't implement a health-care exchange, Obamacare doesn't happen there. The expert's verdict mentions some statements made by Walker, but it doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis or evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Scott Walker intentionally led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn't implement a health-care exchange, Obamacare doesn't happen there. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there is some fuzziness about what could happen in the future and that Walker's decision may not have been solely based on this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. Scott Walker's decision not to create a state-run insurance marketplace. The expert's verdict mentions that there were conservative critics of Obamacare who lobbied Walker not to create an exchange, and their influence may have played a role in his decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of Gov. Scott Walker's actions and statements regarding the implementation of Obamacare in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict mentions some statements made by Walker, but it doesn't provide a thorough examination of his overall stance on the issue.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Gov. Scott Walker's decision not to create a state-run insurance marketplace on the implementation of Obamacare in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict mentions that the decision to let the federal government run the marketplace was seen as a disappointment by Democrats and some prominent business organizations who wanted a state exchange.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any facts, as it is more focused on the perception and belief that Gov. Scott Walker led people to have regarding the implementation of Obamacare in Wisconsin. The expert's verdict does not provide any contradicting facts either."}
