{"Contradict fact": "The claim that both Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis disavowed the Confederacy after the Civil War is contradicted by the evidence provided. Lee did not disavow the Confederacy and even refused to wear his Confederate uniform after the war.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the disavowal of the Confederacy by both Lee and Davis, as there is no evidence to support Davis disavowing the Confederacy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Lee's disassociation from the Confederacy, as he not only refused to wear his Confederate uniform after the war but also declared that the Confederate battle flag should never be raised again.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting unproven or disputed information, such as the claim that mourners at Lee's funeral were barred from wearing their own Confederate uniforms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that both Lee and Davis disavowed the Confederacy after the Civil War, as the evidence provided only supports Lee's disassociation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that both Lee and Davis disavowed the Confederacy based on limited evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the actions and statements of Lee and Davis, such as political or legal considerations."}
