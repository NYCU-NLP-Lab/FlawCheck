{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence of a job called \"penguin erector\" at Edinburgh zoo.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the existence of a penguin erector job.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that penguins fall over and need to be picked up every time a plane flies over the zoo, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the official statement from Edinburgh zoo, which confirms that there is no such position as a penguin erector.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that penguins' behavior is unrelated to aircraft and that the myth of penguins falling over due to planes is not true."}
