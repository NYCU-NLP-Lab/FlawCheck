{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The expert's verdict states that while net farm income has declined in the last five years, there was a period of strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports from 2011 to 2014.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in the price of soybeans and the existence of trade barriers and tariffs are the main reasons for farmers doing poorly for 15 years. The expert's verdict points out that there were other factors, such as strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports, that contributed to a golden period for farmers from 2011 to 2014.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in farmers' performance. The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in net farm income in the last five years could be attributed to factors like the 2012 drought."}
