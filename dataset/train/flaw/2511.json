{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific backing to support the assertion that strokes happen often in the bathroom due to the sequence of wetting the head before the body in the shower.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between the sequence of showering and strokes without providing any scientific basis or evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert opinions of Thanh Phan, head of neuroscience research at Monash Health, and Professor Bruce Campbell, chair of the Stroke Foundation Clinical Council, who both stated that there is no evidence linking showering with strokes.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and variety of causes of strokes, attributing them solely to the incorrect sequence of showering without considering other factors such as clot obstruction or burst blood vessels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert opinions provide alternative explanations for the cause of strokes, such as clot obstruction in blood flow or burst blood vessels, which contradict the claim's assertion about the showering sequence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a logical and scientifically supported argument, as it relies on anecdotal advice from a UiTM Professor without any corroborating evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential risk of strokes happening in the bathroom due to the showering sequence, presenting it as a common occurrence without sufficient evidence."}
