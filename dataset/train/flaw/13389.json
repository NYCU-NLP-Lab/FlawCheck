{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which wealthy taxpayers benefit from deductions in the tax code, as the experts cited in the article indicate that tax preferences are heavily tilted towards the rich.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support, as it is based on the expert opinions of three tax experts and a report from the Tax Policy Center. It would be beneficial to have more comprehensive and diverse sources of evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that middle-income earners receive a significant portion of the deductions in the tax code. The experts cited in the article indicate that tax preferences are heavily skewed towards the wealthy, suggesting that middle-income earners do not receive as many deductions as the claim implies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation, as the experts cited in the article suggest that lower earners have lower tax rates and therefore receive less benefit from deductions compared to wealthier individuals who have more to deduct and pay higher tax rates. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that wealthy taxpayers get \"most of the deductions\" in the tax code."}
