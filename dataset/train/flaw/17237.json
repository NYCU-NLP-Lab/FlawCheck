{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the requirement of a WHO Yellow Vaccination Passport for international travel once borders open. While some countries may require proof of vaccination, it is not a universal requirement.", "Understate": "The claim understates the availability and acceptance of vaccination certificates in some countries. While they may not be required everywhere, some countries have started to use them for travel purposes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC-issued vaccination cards are not recognized by other countries, which may not necessarily be true. The user in the TikTok video states that other countries don't recognize them, but this is a generalization that may not apply to all countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to prove the necessity of a WHO Yellow Vaccination Passport for international travel. The expert's verdict states that COVID-19 vaccination is not required to travel abroad, and the WHO has advised against requiring vaccination for travel.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that proof of vaccination may not be required for travel, and other measures such as quarantine or testing requirements may be in place instead."}
