{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that Mahashivratri is being celebrated in Srinagar's Shankaracharya Temple after decades, when in reality the temple has been lit up for Maha Shivratri every year without any breaks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a viral image shared by multiple individuals, without providing any concrete evidence or historical context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the temple being lit up for Mahashivratri after decades is a significant event, without considering the regular annual celebrations at the temple.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the media attention towards the temple's illumination may have been due to the restructuring of the J&K State, rather than it being a rare occurrence."}
