{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Barack Obama's wins in Ohio by stating that he is only the second Democrat in the last 75 years to win Ohio twice with more than 50 percent of the vote. While it is true that Obama achieved a majority in two elections in a row, there have been other Democrats who have won Ohio in the past, although with lower percentages of the vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or citation to support the statement that Obama is only the second Democrat in the last 75 years to achieve such a feat. The expert had to rely on the official records from the Ohio Secretary of State's office to confirm the percentages of Obama's wins.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Obama's wins in Ohio, such as the specific political climate during those elections, the candidates he was running against, or other factors that may have influenced the outcomes. It presents Obama's wins as solely indicative of his own popularity and not influenced by any other factors."}
