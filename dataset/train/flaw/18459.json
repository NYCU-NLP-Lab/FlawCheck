{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs that will be lost due to Biden's Keystone XL pipeline reversal. The claim states that \"tens of thousands of jobs\" will be lost, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual number of jobs is much lower.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential job losses by using the phrase \"tens of thousands\" instead of providing a specific number. The expert's verdict indicates that the number of jobs lost is significantly lower than the claim suggests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or support to back up the assertion that \"tens of thousands of jobs\" will be lost. The expert's verdict provides conflicting information and alternative explanations for the number of jobs at stake.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the assertion that \"tens of thousands of jobs\" will be lost. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual number of jobs lost is much lower and that there are alternative explanations for the job losses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all job losses are directly attributable to Biden's Keystone XL pipeline reversal. The expert's verdict suggests that the number of jobs lost is not solely due to this decision and that there are other factors at play.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the job losses, such as variances in job numbers in infrastructure development and the impact on Canada's relations with the US. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the job losses beyond Biden's pipeline reversal."}
