{"Contradict fact": "The claim that a Brahmin was beaten by Muslims for praying is contradicted by the Kolkata police's statement, which states that the man was actually a Hindu priest who allegedly molested a woman and was attacked by her family as a consequence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that it is dangerous to even perform Puja at home in West Bengal, implying that such incidents are widespread and common.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the incident occurred as described. It is based solely on a viral message and a video that does not provide clear context or details.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the attack on the man was solely motivated by his religious identity and his act of praying, without considering other possible factors or motives for the incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Kolkata police's statement provides an alternative explanation for the incident, suggesting that it was a consequence of alleged molestation rather than a religiously-motivated attack."}
