{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly are covert Hillary Clinton campaign operatives. The provided evidence only includes an email mentioning Fox News programs as \"hits\" generated by the DNC's communications staff, but it does not document anyone at Fox News actually working for Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the mention of \"hits we've executed\" and \"future hits\" in the email refers to colluding with the DNC to offer positive press to Hillary Clinton. However, the email is from a DNC communications staffer discussing public relations and media coverage, where the term \"hit\" is commonly used to refer to securing press attention for clients or employers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the mention of \"hits we've executed\" and \"future hits\" in the email. It is possible that the term \"hit\" refers to securing press coverage for the DNC's communications arm, rather than colluding with Fox News commentators to attack political opponents of Hillary Clinton.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting the term \"hit\" in the email and making assumptions about the involvement of Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly as covert operatives without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "There is no evidence provided to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays any relevant facts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any established facts but misinterprets the term \"hit\" in the email and makes unsupported assumptions.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not exaggerate any information but rather misinterprets the email and makes unsupported assumptions."}
