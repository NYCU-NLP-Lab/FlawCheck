{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person's home and transmitting it to the cloud, which may be an exaggeration as it implies constant surveillance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Amazon Echo is engaged in continuous recording and transmission without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to substantiate the assertion that Amazon Echo is recording every conversation and transmitting it to the cloud.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that Amazon Echo only starts recording after the wake word is detected, and it discards and replaces ambient sound until then.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for incidents where Amazon Echo may have mistakenly recorded and transmitted conversations, such as mishearing the wake word or technical glitches."}
