{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of suicides attributed to the \"Blue Whale\" suicide game in Russia.

The expert's verdict highlights the lack of conclusive evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to substantiate the claim of more than 130 suicides. The expert's verdict mentions that no deaths have been definitively tied to the game.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the \"Blue Whale\" game and the suicides, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict suggests that depressed or suicidal teenagers may be drawn to the same social media groups, rather than the groups causing them to commit suicide.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the suicides, such as depressed or suicidal teenagers being drawn to the same social media groups. This challenges the claim's assertion of the game's responsibility for the suicides."}
