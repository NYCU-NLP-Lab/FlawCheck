{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times President Obama said he did not have the legal authority to act on immigration. The expert's verdict mentions that there were about 15 statements that suggest this, but the claim states \"over 20 times.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's statements about not having legal authority are contradictory to his actions on immigration. However, the expert's verdict explains that there were different circumstances and contexts in which these statements were made, and that Obama's position on using executive authority had evolved over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for President Obama's statements and actions on immigration, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the potential alignment with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act. The claim does not acknowledge these alternative explanations, suggesting a bias towards a single interpretation.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were about 15 statements supporting the claim, but it does not provide specific evidence or examples of these statements. This lack of detailed support may suggest a bias in the claim's presentation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Obama did take executive action on immigration in 2014. The expert's verdict explains that Obama's position had changed and he believed he had the authority to take action on certain aspects of immigration."}
