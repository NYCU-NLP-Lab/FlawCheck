{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Donald Trump owns Carrier or a significant stake in its parent company, United Technologies, is supported by financial disclosures filed by Trump in May 2016, which show he owns stock in United Technologies. However, the claim lacks additional evidence or documentation to further support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Trump owns stock in United Technologies, he also owns Carrier or a significant stake in its parent company. However, owning stock in a company does not necessarily mean owning the company itself or having a significant stake in its parent company. This assumption is problematic and requires further clarification or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the financial disclosures showing Trump's ownership of United Technologies stock. It is possible that Trump's ownership of stock in United Technologies is unrelated to his ownership or stake in Carrier. Further investigation or clarification is needed to explore alternative explanations for the disclosed ownership.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump's 2016 Personal Financial Disclosure (PFD) did not reflect any investment in Carrier or United Technologies. This discrepancy between the claim and the disclosed financial information raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information from sources that have questionable credibility or bias, such as the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. This raises concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or evidence."}
