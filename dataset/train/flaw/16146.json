{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the restriction on purchasing soda and candy for electronic benefits recipients in Iowa. The expert's verdict mentions that benefit cards can be used to purchase all types of foods that are sold to be eaten at home, including snack foods, candy, and soft drinks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of soda and candy from Iowa's food assistance program will make the state healthier. However, the expert's verdict mentions that such assumptions can be problematic as they often overlook the fact that these foods can offer nourishment and may go on sale.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the statement that electronic benefits recipients in Iowa can no longer purchase soda and candy as of October 1, 2017. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim resembles a news item but is actually from an entertainment website that creates fictional news.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that stories of people buying perceived high-end foods with government benefits often go viral, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the restriction on purchasing soda and candy."}
