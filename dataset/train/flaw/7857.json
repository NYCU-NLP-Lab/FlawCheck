{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about ICE planning a six-day \"Citizens Academy\" training in Chicago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the training will include instruction on firearms and how to make arrests, but it does not provide concrete evidence or official statements from ICE to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives, such as the possibility that the training may not involve civilians carrying out arrests themselves, as explicitly denied by ICE.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the purpose of the Citizens Academy training, as it only mentions ICE's intention to \"debunk misconceptions\" and engage with civilians, without providing a comprehensive understanding of the program's objectives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ICE has explicitly denied activists' claims that the training will involve civilians making arrests.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it simply states the existence of a planned Citizens Academy training without embellishing or overstating its potential impact or implications.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and concise description of the training program, leading to confusion and differing interpretations."}
