{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times Roy Blunt voted to raise his own pay by stating it as 12 times, when it is actually a result of not voting against the automatic cost-of-living adjustments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment is equivalent to voting to raise one's own pay, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Roy Blunt intentionally voted to raise his own pay, as it is based on the absence of voting against the automatic adjustments rather than explicit votes for pay raises.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the alleged pay raises, as it is mentioned that the pay raises were a result of not voting against the automatic cost-of-living adjustments rather than explicit votes for pay raises."}
