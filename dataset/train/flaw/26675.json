{"Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement because it states that \"precisely zero\" terrorists or terror plots have ever been connected with the U.S.-Mexico border to do harm to people within the United States. This implies that there have been no instances at all, which could be an understatement considering the complexity of border security issues.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on outdated information from 2014. The expert's search for more recent news accounts also found no evidence of terrorist plots connected to the border. Therefore, the claim lacks current and comprehensive evidence to fully support its assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of evidence of terrorists or terror plots connected to the U.S.-Mexico border means that there have been none. This assumption may overlook the possibility of undetected or unreported incidents, making it problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim asserts that there have been no terrorists or terror plots connected to the U.S.-Mexico border, there could be alternative explanations for this. For example, it is possible that terrorists may choose alternative entry points or methods rather than crossing the border directly."}
