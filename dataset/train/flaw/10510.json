{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the negative outcomes of intensive instruction for inner-city students by suggesting that they \"fall back and don't succeed\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Eichelberger's office did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim. Additionally, PolitiFact Pennsylvania and the academics they consulted were unable to find studies or papers supporting the idea that a \"less intensive\" track would lead to more success for inner-city students. This lack of supporting evidence suggests a bias in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a \"less intensive\" track would be more beneficial for inner-city students without providing any evidence or rationale to support this assumption. This assumption may be considered problematic as it overlooks the potential benefits of rigorous instruction and college preparation for these students.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Julia C. Duncheon, an expert on college readiness for urban students, stated that it is \"not true\" that lower-income students need \"less intensive\" instruction. She argues that studies show the opposite, indicating that those who have taken more rigorous classes are more likely to persist in college. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that a \"less intensive\" track would lead to better outcomes for inner-city students."}
