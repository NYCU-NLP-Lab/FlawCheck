{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the tax increases in Austin by stating that they are the fastest-growing of any major city in the nation without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Austin has the fastest-growing tax increases. The evidence provided is anecdotal and does not provide concrete data or comparisons to other cities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rejection of a rail-and-roads proposition is evidence of a burden caused by tax increases, without considering other factors that may have influenced the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the burden on Austin, such as surging property values and changes in government spending plans, which could have contributed to the perceived tax increases."}
