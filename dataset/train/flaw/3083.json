The expert explains that muskets were used during the American Revolution, which occurred before the drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a fabricated quote attributed to Gretchen Carlson. The expert mentions that the quote was published on a clickbait website and was later picked up by other websites without verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gretchen Carlson made a statement about the Second Amendment being written before guns were invented. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for Carlson's comments, stating that she made a break with conservative orthodoxy by advocating for the reinstatement of the assault-weapons ban after the Orlando nightclub shooting. The claim misrepresents her stance by fabricating a quote about the Second Amendment."}
