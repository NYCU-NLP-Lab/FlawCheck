{"Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that conservative personality Ann Coulter initially defended Tulsi Gabbard by stating that she didn't vote for the resolution because she is a senator, but later clarifies that Coulter was wrong and that Gabbard is indeed a member of the House and did vote for the resolution. This suggests a momentary lapse or mistake in Coulter's understanding of Gabbard's role, indicating a faltering bias.", "Lack enough support": "The claim itself does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Tulsi Gabbard did not vote on the impeachment resolution because she is a senator. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides evidence from the House of Representatives' website and other sources to confirm that Gabbard did vote for the resolution as a member of the House. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tulsi Gabbard did not vote on the impeachment resolution because she is a senator. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Gabbard is actually a member of the House and did vote for the resolution. Therefore, the claim is based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents one explanation for why Tulsi Gabbard did not vote on the impeachment resolution, stating that it is because she is a senator. However, the expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by clarifying that Gabbard is a member of the House and did vote for the resolution. This suggests that there is an alternative explanation to the claim."}
