{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it presents Walker's statement as \"forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing',\" which may be an overstatement of his actual words.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Walker made the statement about invasive ultrasounds being \"just a cool thing.\" The evidence provided includes a TV ad by NARAL Pro-Choice America and an audio clip from an interview, but it does not provide a direct and verifiable source for the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Walker's support for a law requiring ultrasounds before abortion equates to him considering it a \"cool thing.\" This assumption may not accurately reflect Walker's intentions or beliefs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Walker's statement, such as him referring to the ultrasound requirement as a necessary step for informed decision-making rather than expressing personal excitement or endorsement."}
