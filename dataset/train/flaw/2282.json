It fails to acknowledge that the federal income tax only accounts for 45 percent of federal tax revenue, while payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, excise taxes, and other taxes contribute to the remaining percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that the top 1 percent pays over half of the entire revenue for the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising taxes on the rich would \"destroy those who have capital\" and \"devastate those that are trying to get jobs,\" without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of tax burden or propose any alternative solutions to address the issue of tax fairness."}
