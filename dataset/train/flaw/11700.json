{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of a system for growers and dairies to bring a workforce legally into the U.S. It fails to acknowledge the existence of the H-2A visa program, which allows farmers to hire seasonal workers legally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is no legal way for growers and dairies to bring in a workforce, which is a problematic assumption as it neglects the H-2A visa program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that there is no system for legal workforce importation. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the H-2A visa program, which contradicts the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the H-2A visa program serves as a legal system for growers and dairies to bring in a workforce, although it has its limitations and criticisms."}
