{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that George Flinn has been a \"no show\" at scheduled \"forums.\" The article mentions that the campaign manager provided details of the events, but it doesn't specify what those details are or if they are substantial enough to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that George Flinn confirmed his attendance at the events but did not show up. However, the article provides statements from organizers of some of the events who say that Flinn was not invited or did attend some of the events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions that one of the events had a fashion show instead of a speaker, which could explain why Flinn was not present. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for his absence at some of the events.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on the assertion made by Bergmann's campaign without providing concrete evidence or counterarguments.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility that Flinn did attend some of the events mentioned, as stated by the president of the Shelby County Republican Women's Club.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements from the Republican Women of Purpose spokeswoman who said that Flinn was not invited to speak at their meetings."}
