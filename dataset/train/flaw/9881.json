{"Understate": "The claim may understate the involvement of Saudi Arabia in the fight against ISIS, as it mentions that Saudi Arabia has deployed only a small number of fighter jets against ISIS.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Saudi Arabia is not prioritizing the fight against ISIS. The evidence provided only shows the involvement of Saudi Arabia in the conflict in Yemen.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Saudi Arabia should prioritize the fight against ISIS over other conflicts, such as the one in Yemen. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account Saudi Arabia's regional interests and alliances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Saudi Arabia's focus on the conflict in Yemen, such as the threat posed by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels to Saudi Arabia's security and regional stability. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
