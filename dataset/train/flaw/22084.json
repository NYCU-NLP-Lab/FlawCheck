{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between farmers' protests and the restoration of Kashmir's special status. The photo does not provide evidence of farmers specifically demanding this restoration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that farmers want the restoration of Kashmir's special status. The photo alone does not provide enough context or information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo depicts farmers protesting for the restoration of Kashmir's special status, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photo, as it was previously posted on the Facebook page of a political group that has supported the demand for Khalistan, a separate country for Sikhs, and opposed the abrogation of Article 370. This suggests that the photo may not be directly related to the farmers' protests."}
