{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the involvement of Congress leader VM Singh in the farmers' protest by stating that he is leading the protest, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that VM Singh is leading the farmers' protest. The provided evidence only mentions that he is participating in the protest, but does not establish his leadership role.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that VM Singh's ownership of property worth Rs 631 crores contradicts his participation in the farmers' protest. However, it does not consider the possibility that he may have legitimate reasons for supporting the protest despite his personal wealth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests a political conspiracy by alleging that Congress members are leading the farmers' agitation. However, it does not consider alternative explanations for VM Singh's participation, such as his genuine concern for farmers' rights.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on sources that have been found promoting misinformation or sharing false claims, such as the Twitter user @BefittingFacts and the right-wing website OpIndia. This raises doubts about the credibility of the information presented."}
