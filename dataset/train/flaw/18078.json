{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Twitter reaches only 15 percent of the population\" lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet by Mark Cuban without providing any additional evidence or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that for a tweet to reach the general population, the mainstream media has to report on it. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the potential reach and influence of social media platforms like Twitter.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Twitter itself reported having 328 million monthly active users as of June 2017, which is significantly higher than 15 percent of the population.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the reach and impact of Twitter by focusing only on the percentage of the population reached directly, without considering the indirect reach through retweets, mentions, and media coverage.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information and perspectives, such as the differing number of followers between President Trump and President Obama, and the disagreement between Mark Cuban and Kellyanne Conway.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as differences in Twitter usage among different demographics or the possibility that not all Twitter users actively engage with the platform."}
