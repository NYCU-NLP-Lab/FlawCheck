{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert was unable to locate any reliable sources reporting that Cruz's current net worth is $4.6 million. The expert could only find estimates and financial disclosure forms indicating a net worth of at most $4 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cruz's net worth increased dramatically during his time in the Senate, but there is no clear evidence or reliable source to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that Cruz's alleged net worth of $500,000 in 2012 is inconsistent with estimates from OpenSecrets.org, which estimated his worth at $3.47 million in the same year. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or discrepancies in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Cruz's actual net worth by suggesting it is $4.6 million when the expert's analysis indicates it could be less, possibly even in the negative.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cruz's salary is accurately stated as $174,000 per year, according to the U.S. Senate's website.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Cruz's wealth by stating a specific figure of $4.6 million without sufficient evidence or reliable sources to support it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on partisan memes and social media posts, which the expert states are often based more on fiction than on fact. This suggests a potential bias in the claim's credibility and reliability."}
