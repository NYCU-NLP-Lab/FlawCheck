{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decrease in terrorist incidents worldwide by stating that there has not been a substantial increase. The data provided by the expert shows that there has been an increase in worldwide terror attacks during Obama's time in office.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in terrorist incidents worldwide by not acknowledging the 7% increase in attacks during Obama's time in office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that there has not been a substantial increase in terrorist incidents worldwide. The data provided by the expert shows an increase in attacks, but there is no clear definition of what constitutes a \"substantial\" increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of terrorist incidents is the only measure of the threat of terrorism. The expert's verdict mentions that there has been a decrease in attacks and deaths in certain countries, which could suggest that the nature and location of terrorist incidents have changed rather than the overall number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in terrorist incidents worldwide. The expert's verdict mentions the emergence of ISIS and the ideology of hatred and killing spreading, which could be contributing factors to the increase in attacks."}
