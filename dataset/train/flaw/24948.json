{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of Americans who die waiting for healthcare due to cost. The experts suggest that the math used to arrive at the 30,000 figure is questionable and that there isn't enough evidence to fully validate or refute the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The experts mention that there isn't enough evidence to entirely validate or repudiate the claim. The math used to arrive at the 30,000 figure is considered questionable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 30,000 Americans who die waiting for healthcare do so specifically because of the cost. The experts mention that the link between insurance coverage and mortality is not statistically significant and cannot be applied so broadly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts suggest that while cost barriers may prevent thousands of Americans from accessing lifesaving medical care, the specific link between cost and mortality is not well-supported by the evidence."}
