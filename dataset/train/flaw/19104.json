{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential cost savings of the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles rule, stating that it would reduce the cost of cars \"by more than $3000,\" which is an inflated figure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fuel efficiency plan would actually make cars \"substantially safer.\" The expert's verdict states that the claim is wrong about car safety.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles rule would result in cost savings and increased safety.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that freezing the fuel efficiency standards and revoking California's ability to set stricter standards would automatically lead to cost reductions and increased safety, which is a problematic assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the doubts and skepticism expressed by experts regarding the administration's analysis and the potential impact of the fuel efficiency plan. The expert's verdict mentions that many experts doubt the administration's analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the potential cost savings and increased safety of cars other than the implementation of the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles rule."}
