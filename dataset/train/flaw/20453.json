{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Saudi Arabian government has released an Arabic version of the Bhagavad Gita without providing any evidence or credible sources to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no news report or credible source mentioned to back up the claim of the Saudi Arabian government releasing an Arabic translation of the Bhagavad Gita.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that saying \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\" puts Islam in danger, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert that the image of the book cover showing Krishna and Arjuna with Arabic text may be related to the translation done by Ravanari Prabhu, an ISKCON devotee, and not an official release by the Saudi Arabian government."}
