{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money spent by Gov. Rick Perry on D.C. lobbyists. The expert's investigation found that the total spent on Washington lobbying by private firms was above $1 million, but it does not specify if all of that money was spent by Gov. Perry alone.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the actual cost of the luxury house that Gov. Perry lives in. The claim states that it costs taxpayers $10,000 a month, but it does not provide any evidence or sources to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the accusation that Gov. Perry spent over a million dollars on D.C. lobbyists. The expert's investigation found that the total spent on Washington lobbying by private firms was above $1 million, but it does not provide a breakdown of how much of that money was spent by Gov. Perry specifically.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that spending money on D.C. lobbyists and living in a luxury house are inherently negative actions. It does not provide any context or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Gov. Perry may have spent money on D.C. lobbyists or the actual cost of the luxury house he lives in. It presents these actions as negative without exploring any potential justifications or reasons behind them."}
