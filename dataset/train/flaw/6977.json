{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Google removed images of Bill Clinton with Jeffrey Epstein from their search results. The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence that such images even existed in the first place.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Google's search results were manipulated to protect the Clintons, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Google stated no images of Epstein or Clinton were removed from their search results and that no manual changes were made to alter the display of related images.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the alleged removal of images, suggesting a cover-up or deliberate action by Google, when there is no evidence to support this.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of evidence and proof provided for the alleged removal of images, as acknowledged by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the absence of images of Clinton with Epstein in search results, such as the possibility that such images simply do not exist.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on unsupported rumors and tweets without providing substantial evidence or verification."}
