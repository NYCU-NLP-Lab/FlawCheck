{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that patients are being killed in hospitals to show a surge in coronavirus deaths, which may be an exaggerated statement without sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a video shared on social media, but there is no substantial evidence or reliable sources provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of a patient being suffocated is connected to hospitals intentionally causing deaths to inflate coronavirus numbers, without providing solid evidence or logical reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video mentioned in the claim is associated with an incident in Bangladesh where a man was strangled in a hospital bed after a fight broke out between two parties. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that hospitals are intentionally killing patients for financial gain."}
