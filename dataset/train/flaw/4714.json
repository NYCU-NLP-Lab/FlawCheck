{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Indonesian governor Anies Baswedan deported Chinese immigrants, which may be an exaggeration based on the evidence provided. The video shows a raid on illegal Chinese immigrants, but it does not explicitly show Baswedan personally deporting them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Anies Baswedan deported Chinese immigrants. The video only shows a raid on illegal immigrants, and there is no direct evidence linking Baswedan to the deportation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of the video showing a raid on Chinese immigrants automatically means that Baswedan was responsible for their deportation. This assumption is problematic as it does not consider other possible explanations or individuals involved in the deportation process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the video, such as it being a general news report on a raid conducted by immigration officials rather than a direct action taken by Baswedan. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
