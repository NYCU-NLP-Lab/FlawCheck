{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Facebook by stating that they \"shut down\" the Gateway Pundit and Breitbart reports, when in fact the articles are still searchable on Facebook.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Facebook is picking sides in the Alabama Senate race.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Facebook's actions are motivated by a bias in favor of one side in the race, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Gateway Pundit article was flagged by Facebook and downranked, rather than being completely removed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Facebook's actions, such as their efforts to combat fake news and promote fact-checking."}
