{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is \"among the lowest\" in the country lacks sufficient data to support it. The only available data is for 2015, and there is no data for prior years to make a comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rate of deadly force used by Milwaukee police is low based on the 2015 data, without considering other potential factors or alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it acknowledges that the rate of deadly force can vary significantly in a given year, citing an example of four fatal shootings in 2013.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low rate of deadly force in Milwaukee, such as different policing strategies or community factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential use of deadly force by Milwaukee police by only focusing on fatal shootings, without considering other forms of force or non-fatal incidents.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were three fatal shootings by Milwaukee police in 2016, which challenges the assertion of having a low rate of deadly force.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
