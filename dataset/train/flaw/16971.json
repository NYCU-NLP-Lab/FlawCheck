{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on photos that were published in 2018, a year before the bushfires occurred.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the dog saved the koala from the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, but there is no evidence or direct connection between the dog and the bushfires.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos were taken in 2018, not during the bushfires.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the koala on the dog's back, such as the koala seeking warmth or comfort, rather than the dog saving it from the bushfires."}
