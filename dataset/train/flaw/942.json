{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the United States has officially declared Nigeria a terrorist and unstable nation and vowed never to sell weapons to them. This is not true, as the United States has not made such a declaration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States has never declared Nigeria a terrorist nation, according to its list of state sponsors of terrorism.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or official statements to back up its assertion that Trump rejected a new arms deal with Nigeria.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rejection of arms deal by the United States is due to Nigeria being declared a terrorist state, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as it is mentioned that the United States under Obama refused to sell arms to Nigeria due to human rights abuses by the Nigerian army. This suggests that the rejection of arms deal might be based on different reasons than the claim suggests."}
