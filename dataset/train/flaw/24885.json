{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a misleading Facebook post and a screenshot of the post as evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deployment of missiles by Iran is directly related to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani by the US, without providing concrete evidence for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used does not show the actual event of Iran firing missiles at US bases in Iraq on January 8, 2020.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Iran's missile deployment by stating that it has left Russia and China in confusion and Arab countries in fearful silence, without providing sufficient evidence for these claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Iran's missile deployment, such as ongoing regional conflicts or military exercises, which are not explored in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the image by not acknowledging its previous circulation in media reports about Iranian medium-range ballistic missiles since 2013."}
