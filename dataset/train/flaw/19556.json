{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because the expert's verdict states that O'Rourke has not been consistent in his public comments about whether it's time for Congress to act on impeachment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because the expert's verdict mentions that while there are news articles showing O'Rourke's personal support for impeachment, none of them explicitly state that \"it's time\" for Congress to act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that O'Rourke has been consistently advocating for impeachment proceedings for more than a year, which the expert's verdict refutes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation because O'Rourke tends to make distinctions between impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate, indicating that his statements may not necessarily mean it's time for Congress to act."}
