{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of benami companies registered to the address of Kolkata police headquarters. The expert's verdict states that the claim is far from the truth and the number provided in the claim is not accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the address of Kolkata police headquarters is not 9/12 Lal Bazar, but 18 Lal Bazar. The expert's verdict confirms this by stating that the address mentioned in the claim is incorrect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet by a self-proclaimed 'whistleblower' and 'anti-corruption activist' without providing any substantial evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the raid on Kolkata police commissioner's residence is connected to the registration of benami companies at the police headquarters address. However, the expert's verdict states that there is no connection between the two events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the address mentioned in the claim actually belongs to the Mercantile Building, which is located at a distance from the Lal Bazar police headquarters. This suggests that the companies registered at that address may not be connected to the police headquarters.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
