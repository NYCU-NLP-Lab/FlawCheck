{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its validity. The origins of the video are unclear, and there is no substantial information about where, when, or who shot the footage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video accurately depicts a child being flipped by a powerful jet of water. However, there are doubts about the authenticity of the footage, as some viewers expressed skepticism about the lack of concern shown by the people in the video and the strength of the fountain's pressure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the incident shown in the video, such as the fountain being improperly calibrated, the children playing in an area where they weren't supposed to be, or the fountain's design intended for interactive play.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the exact origins of the video are still unclear and there is no definitive evidence to support its authenticity.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough information or evidence to fully support its validity.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the power of the jet of water by stating that it is \"powerful\" without sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
