{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the name \"Ipsos MORI\" does not translate to \"They DIE\" in Latin. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the name was formed through a merger and does not have the claimed meaning.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a false translation of the company's name and does not provide any substantial evidence to support the conspiracy theory.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the name of the research company, Ipsos MORI, has a hidden meaning related to the pandemic conspiracy. However, this assumption is unfounded and contradicted by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the origin of the company's name, stating that it was formed through a merger between Ipsos and MORI. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's conspiracy theory and suggests a more plausible reason for the company's name."}
