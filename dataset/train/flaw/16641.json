{"Understate": "The claim states that less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses, which is significantly lower than the 10 percent goal set by the City of Providence. This suggests that the actual percentage is being understated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by a 2013 news story and the statement from the campaign, but it does not provide extensive data or evidence to fully support the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the goal of 10 percent for women and minority businesses is a reasonable and achievable target, without considering potential challenges or limitations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore potential alternative explanations for why less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses, such as economic factors, competition, or other factors that may influence the contracting process."}
