{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border by stating that there were enough to fill the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium, which implies a very large number.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual number of illegal immigrants crossing the border by not providing an exact figure and instead using a comparison to the stadium's capacity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that enough illegal immigrants crossed the border to fill the stadium.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all apprehensions at the southwest border are illegal immigrants, without considering the possibility of overlap or individuals being denied legal entry and later attempting illegal entry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that the majority of illegal immigrants crossing the border are from Mexico, as it features the Mexican flag in the stadium picture, but this may not be accurate as the composition of immigrants apprehended at the border has changed in recent years."}
