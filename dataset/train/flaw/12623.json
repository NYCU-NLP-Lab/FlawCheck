{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of troops who will not see their families for Thanksgiving. The actual number is lower than the claim suggests.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of troops that have been deployed to the border. It claims that 15,000 troops have been sent, but the actual number is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that troops will not see their families for Thanksgiving.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deployment of troops to the border is solely a \"stunt\" by President Trump, without considering other potential reasons or justifications for the deployment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deployment of troops, such as providing logistical support to the Department of Homeland Security."}
