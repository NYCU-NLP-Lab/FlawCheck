{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the 2011 nuclear agreement with Russia by stating that it resulted in a \"massive reduction in nuclear weapons.\"", "Understate": "The claim understates the limitations of the agreement, as it does not require the destruction or reduction of nuclear weapons or place limits on shorter-range nuclear weapons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to substantiate the assertion of a \"massive reduction in nuclear weapons.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in deployed strategic nuclear warheads under the New START agreement qualifies as a \"massive reduction in nuclear weapons,\" which may be a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Russia has actually increased its number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads since the treaty took effect, indicating that there has not been a reduction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for any reduction in nuclear weapons that occurred, such as other international agreements or factors unrelated to Hillary Clinton's actions."}
