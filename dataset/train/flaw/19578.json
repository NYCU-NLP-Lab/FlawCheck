{"Understate": "The claim may understate the seriousness of the crimes committed by immigrants who were deported from Illinois, as it states that fewer than 20% of deportees were charged with any serious crime. However, the data provided indicates that 160 out of 853 deportees (approximately 18.7%) had serious criminal convictions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it relies on data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which may have limitations in how Illinois deportations and serious crimes are defined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigrants who were deported from Illinois are representative of all undocumented immigrants in the state. However, it is possible that those who were deported had a higher likelihood of having serious criminal convictions compared to the overall undocumented immigrant population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why fewer than 20% of deportees from Illinois were charged with serious crimes. Factors such as the enforcement priorities of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the availability of resources may contribute to this statistic."}
