{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the first snow globe was created by accident while attempting to build a brighter lightbulb. The expert's verdict clarifies that Erwin Perzy, an Austrian surgical instruments mechanic, accidentally created one of the first snow globes in 1900 while attempting to fashion a brighter light bulb.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it doesn't provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the statement. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides detailed information about Erwin Perzy and his accidental creation of the snow globe, including references to articles and interviews.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the first snow globe was created solely by accident while trying to build a brighter lightbulb. The expert's verdict reveals that the idea for the snow globe was inspired by shoemakers using a glass globe filled with water in front of a candle for more light, and Erwin Perzy's experiments with different materials led to the creation of the snow globe.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the invention of the snow globe. The expert's verdict mentions that the first snow globes predate Perzy's invention by two decades, suggesting that there may have been other inventors or variations of snow globes before Perzy's accidental creation."}
