{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"ISIS is in 32 countries\" lacks enough support because the actual number of countries with an ISIS presence is difficult to determine and varies depending on the definition of a \"serious presence.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of countries with an ISIS presence is a fixed and easily quantifiable figure, which is a problematic assumption given the fluid nature of terrorist organizations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of countries with an ISIS presence, as experts suggest that the actual number is likely larger than 32.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies on a broad definition of ISIS presence that includes countries where ISIS has no known military presence, such as the United States and Canada.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the claim, such as the presence of ISIS supporters or affiliated terror networks in certain countries, rather than direct military presence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the responsibility for ISIS cannot be solely attributed to Hillary Clinton, as stated by the experts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of ISIS's presence by stating a specific number of countries without considering the dynamic nature of the group's strength and influence."}
