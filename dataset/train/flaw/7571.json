{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the Breyers ice cream shown in the video is actually a \"frozen dairy dessert\" and not ice cream, which is not adequately explained in the video.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Breyers ice cream doesn't melt, as the provided evidence only shows a specific video and does not provide a comprehensive analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the lack of melting in the Breyers ice cream shown in the video is due to the brand skirting FDA regulations, when in fact, several dessert manufacturers use FDA-approved ingredients to control the melt rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the lack of melting in the Breyers ice cream shown in the video is due to the addition of gums and other ingredients to control the melting rate, which is a common practice in the ice cream industry."}
