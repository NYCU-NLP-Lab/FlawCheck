{"Lack enough support": "The claim states that the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of the Texas economy, but there is no specific data or evidence provided to support this percentage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the oil and gas industry's share of the state economy remains at 35% even after a historically tumultuous year, without providing any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative ways of measuring the economic impact of the oil and gas industry, such as the number of jobs it creates or the amount of income it generates.", "Falters at times": "The claim relies on a quote from Chairperson Christi Craddick of the Texas Railroad Commission, who mentions that \"last year\" the industry was about 35% of the state's economy. This implies that the claim may not be up-to-date or accurately reflect the current state of the economy.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the economic impact of the oil and gas industry by not considering other factors or measurements that could contribute to its overall impact on the Texas economy.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of the Texas economy, which could be an exaggeration if the actual percentage is lower.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the oil and gas sector directly comprised around 15% of the state's gross state product between 2019 and early 2020, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis."}
