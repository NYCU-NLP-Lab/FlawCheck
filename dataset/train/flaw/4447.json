{"Understate": "The claim understates the average Medicaid costs for homeless individuals, as it states that the costs average about $60,000 per person, while the actual average is $10,795 per person per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the numbers provided in the source do not match the claim made by Anne Nolan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by using the highest Medicaid bills of a select group of 67 individuals to represent the average costs for all long-term homeless people.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations, such as the need to house the most vulnerable homeless individuals to save the most money, as suggested by Eric Hirsch."}
