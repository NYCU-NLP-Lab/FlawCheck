{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of jihadists swimming in the embassy pool in Tripoli. The expert's verdict clarifies that the video in question was taken at a residential annex of the U.S. mission, not the actual embassy, and that the compound is being safeguarded and has not been ransacked.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that jihadists are swimming in the embassy pool. The expert's verdict provides information that contradicts this claim, such as the clarification that the video was taken at a residential annex and not the embassy itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals in the video are jihadists. The expert's verdict points out that the individuals occupying the residential compound were members of the Dawn of Libya militia, which had sought to secure the embassy compounds rather than carry out jihadist activities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of individuals in the video, such as the involvement of local militia groups in securing the embassy compounds. The expert's verdict highlights the role of the Dawn of Libya militia in securing the compound after fighting with a rival militia.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was taken at a residential annex of the U.S. mission, not the embassy itself. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the U.S. Ambassador to Libya and verified sources that confirm this contradiction.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in this claim."}
