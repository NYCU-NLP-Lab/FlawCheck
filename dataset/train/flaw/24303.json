{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the amount other NATO member countries spent on defense was heading down three years ago contradicts the fact that NATO Europe and Canada had actually increased defense spending in 2015 and 2016.", "Exaggerate": "President Trump exaggerated the size of the U.S. trade deficit with the European Union, both currently and before he took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that defense spending was heading in the wrong direction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decrease in defense spending by NATO member countries is inherently negative, without providing any context or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the decrease in defense spending, such as changes in national priorities or economic factors."}
