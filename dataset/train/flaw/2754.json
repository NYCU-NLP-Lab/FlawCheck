{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support from credible sources. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no information on the Amul website or news reports about the company shutting down its chilling centers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Amul will shut down its chilling centers from March 21 without providing any valid reasoning or evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the notice is fake and that Amul's managing director confirmed that the chilling centers will not be closed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the situation by falsely stating that Amul will shut down its chilling centers, while the expert's verdict confirms that there is no such plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that there has been a shift in demand for milk from retail outlets to e-commerce platforms and Amul kiosks due to the COVID-19 scare, but this does not indicate a shutdown of chilling centers."}
