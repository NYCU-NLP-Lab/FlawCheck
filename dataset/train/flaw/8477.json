{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Hillary Clinton's involvement by stating that she colluded with big business to maintain slave wages for workers.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of evidence available to support the assertion by stating that the memos obtained by Wikileaks only strongly suggest, but do not prove without a doubt, the State Department's involvement.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing additional context and information that may weaken the argument, such as the fact that three-quarters of Haitians live on less than $2 a day.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Hillary Clinton personally worked with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage. The evidence provided is based on memos and cables obtained by Wikileaks, which may not be sufficient to establish a direct link.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the opposition to raising the minimum wage was solely driven by U.S. corporations and Hillary Clinton's involvement, without considering other factors or stakeholders that may have influenced the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explicitly consider alternative explanations for the opposition to raising the minimum wage, such as concerns about the impact on the economy or the potential loss of trade preferences."}
