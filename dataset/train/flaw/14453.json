{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of times Sen. Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes by including non-binding resolutions and double-counting multiple votes on the same legislation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it includes votes that do not actually change tax law and counts votes on budget resolutions that do not directly result in tax increases.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for budget resolutions or to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is equivalent to voting for a tax increase, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the votes, such as voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution rather than voting for a tax increase."}
