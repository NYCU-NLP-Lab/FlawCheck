{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the full speeches that Clinton gave have not been released, and the authenticity of the leaked emails has not been confirmed by the Clinton campaign. This lack of supporting evidence raises doubts about the claim's validity.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim twists and distorts the excerpts from Clinton's speeches. This indicates a problematic assumption that the provided excerpts accurately represent Clinton's views and intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict points out that the quote attributed to Sidney Blumenthal does not explicitly state that the Benghazi attack was preventable. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of Blumenthal's statement.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict states that Trump's claims about Clinton's speeches contain distortions and misrepresentations. This contradicts the claim's assertion that Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack was almost certainly preventable.", "Exaggerate": "Although not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict, the claim may be seen as exaggerating the certainty of Blumenthal's statement by using the phrase \"almost certainly preventable.\" Without the full context of Blumenthal's statement, it is unclear if such certainty can be justified.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Trump interrupted himself to provide commentary while reading the excerpts from Clinton's speeches. This suggests that the claim may falter or lack consistency due to potential inconsistencies or inaccuracies in Trump's presentation of the excerpts."}
