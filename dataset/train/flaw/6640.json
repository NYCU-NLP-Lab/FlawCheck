{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that the price of a Big Mac in Denmark is substantially more than in the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high pay of McDonald's employees in Denmark is the cause of the price difference for the Big Mac, which may not be a valid assumption without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the price difference, such as menu prices varying between McDonald's locations and informal studies suggesting different conclusions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information. While some sources indicate that the price of a Big Mac is roughly the same in both countries, others suggest a slight difference.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the price of a Big Mac in Denmark is not substantially higher than in the United States, as supported by the expert's verdict and the Big Mac Index.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the price difference by stating that the price is roughly the same, even though there may be a slight variation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the price difference by using the term \"substantially more\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim."}
