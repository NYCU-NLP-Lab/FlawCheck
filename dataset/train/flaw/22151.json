{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Sikh man in the video is shouting pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans during the farmers protest. The video itself does not provide clear audio or context for the slogans being shouted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Sikh man's shouting of \"long live Pakistan and long live Khalistan\" during the farmers protest is inherently pro-Pakistan and anti-India. However, without further information or context, it is not possible to definitively determine the intentions or beliefs behind the slogans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it is shown to be from a cricket match between Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2019. The video may not be related to the 2020 farmers protest at all, and the slogans could be related to the cricket match rather than any political statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is being shared in a misleading context. The video is being misrepresented as being from the 2020 farmers protest, when it is actually from a cricket match in 2019.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of faltering bias in the provided claim."}
