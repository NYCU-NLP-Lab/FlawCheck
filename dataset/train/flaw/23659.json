{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that \"a hundred ISIS terrorists were caught in Guatemala.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the Guatemalan President announced the arrest and deportation of 100 individuals \"highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS.\" However, it does not specify that they were all confirmed ISIS terrorists.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the terrorists were caught as part of the migrant caravan heading to the United States. The expert's verdict explains that the caravan did not form or reach the Guatemalan border until after the suspected terrorists had already been arrested and deported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct connection between the arrested individuals and the migrant caravan, implying that they were traveling together. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the two events were separate and not linked. The claim fails to acknowledge this alternative explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the individuals with links to terrorist groups were arrested before the migrant caravan reached the Guatemalan border. This challenges the claim's assumption of a direct connection between the two events.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the suspected terrorists were arrested and deported before the migrant caravan arrived at the Guatemalan border. The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this contradiction.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in this claim."}
