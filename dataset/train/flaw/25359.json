{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the potential cost to taxpayers by stating that it will be \"up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity.\" This implies that the cost will always be at the maximum level, which may not be accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sales tax increase will solely finance a rail system for the City of Tampa, without considering other potential uses for the funds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the estimated cost of $300 million per year.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative uses for the funds raised through the sales tax increase, such as expanded bus service and road building."}
