{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Rep. Phil Gingrey gave the government the power to electronically spy on Americans without a warrant. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim accuses Gingrey of giving the government the power to \"electronically spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen. All YOUR Private Information Collected. Analyzed. Graphed. Categorized. STORED. Without a Warrant.\" This could be seen as an exaggeration of the actual impact of Gingrey's actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support in terms of providing specific evidence or examples to back up the accusation against Rep. Phil Gingrey. The expert's verdict mentions that PolitiFact Georgia asked for more information on how Gingrey has given the government the power to electronically spy on Americans, but it does not provide any additional evidence or information to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. Phil Gingrey gave the government the power to electronically spy on Americans without a warrant based on his support for the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). However, the expert's verdict mentions that the bill contains privacy protections and that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto it. Therefore, the claim's assumption that Gingrey's support for CISPA automatically means he gave the government such power may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rep. Phil Gingrey's support for CISPA. The expert's verdict mentions that Gingrey co-sponsored CISPA, which allows corporations to share information with intelligence agencies to address cyber and national security threats, child exploitation, and bodily harm. These alternative reasons for Gingrey's support are not acknowledged in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing a clear and concise argument. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is presented in a YouTube video with surveillance imagery, references to \"Big Brother,\" and the song \"Private Eyes\" by Hall and Oates. This presentation style may distract from the clarity and effectiveness of the claim's argument.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Rep. Phil Gingrey's support for CISPA by not fully addressing the concerns raised by the expert. The expert's verdict mentions that Michael Opitz, one of Gingrey's primary challengers, considers CISPA a big step towards tyranny and compares it to George Orwell's \"1984\" on steroids. The claim does not fully acknowledge or address these concerns."}
