{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference between a football coach kneeling in prayer and an NFL player taking a knee in protest by stating that one is celebrated while the other is fired.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that a football coach has been fired for kneeling in prayer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the First Amendment applies to both the football coach's prayer and the NFL player's protest, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the coach in question was not fired but rather his contract was not renewed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the difference in treatment between a football coach and an NFL player, such as differences in contractual agreements or team policies."}
