{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money.\" It is based on a mention of a Gallup poll without providing any further details or specific findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Gallup poll mentioned accurately represents the views and opinions of all Egyptians regarding U.S. aid. However, it fails to consider potential limitations or biases in the poll methodology that could affect the results.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the level of opposition to U.S. aid in Egypt. The expert's verdict indicates that the opposition to aid is even more widespread among Egyptians than the claim suggests, with 82 percent opposing such aid according to a Gallup poll.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the opposition towards U.S. aid in Egypt. It simplifies the issue by solely attributing it to Egyptians not wanting the money, without considering other geopolitical or ideological factors that could influence public opinion."}
