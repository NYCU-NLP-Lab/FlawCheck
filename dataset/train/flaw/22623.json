{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of migrants who entered the country unlawfully under President Joe Biden in 2021. The actual number reported by CBP is 39,628, not 108,000.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only 9,000 migrants illegally passed through the United States border in 2020 under President Donald Trump. The expert states that this claim is inaccurate and that the Border Patrol encountered far more than 9,000 individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on Facebook posts without providing any credible sources or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of apprehensions reported by CBP represents the total number of unauthorized immigrants who crossed the border, which is a problematic assumption according to the immigration expert quoted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents an alternative explanation by suggesting that Biden said he inherited \"a mess\" at the border, but the expert clarifies that the quote is more closely related to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Biden's reference to the Trump administration's Covid-19 response."}
