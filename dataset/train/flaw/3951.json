{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the garbage left behind after the rally by simply stating \"piles of garbage\" without providing specific details or evidence of the scale of the mess.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the garbage shown in the video is indeed from President Trump's rally. It only provides a video and a tweet as sources, which may not be enough to establish a direct connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the garbage, such as the possibility that it was left by attendees of a different event or that it was unrelated to the rally altogether."}
