{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Prop. 64 by stating that it allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers. The expert's verdict states that the claim is misleading and that the initiative does not explicitly allow such ads.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that marijuana smoking ads would be allowed on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Prop. 64 would lead to the legalization of marijuana smoking ads on TV, which the expert's verdict states is misleading. The assumption may not be supported by the actual language and provisions of the initiative.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be considered to falter at times because it presents a potentially misleading statement about the impact of Prop. 64 on marijuana smoking ads. The expert's verdict highlights the need for clarification and adjustment of the claims made by both sides of the campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that the judge ruled that the Yes on 64 campaign's statement that \"Nothing in 64 makes it legal to show marijuana ads on TV. Federal law prohibits it!\" should remain unchanged. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Prop. 64 allows marijuana smoking ads on TV."}
