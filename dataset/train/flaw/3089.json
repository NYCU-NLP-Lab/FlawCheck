{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on allegations that were initially regarded with skepticism due to a lack of evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, as the claim only focuses on the role of the U.S. Census Bureau.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the initial denial by the Census Bureau itself regarding their involvement in the relocations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it mentions that the allegations were initially regarded with skepticism, indicating a lack of certainty.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the information shared by the U.S. Census Bureau directly led to the targeting of Japanese Americans for relocation and internment, without considering other factors or decision-making processes involved.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the Census Bureau's complicity, as the evidence found by Seltzer and Anderson in 2000 did not confirm the sharing of confidential information about individuals."}
