{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence of a \"long tradition\" of not nominating and confirming a Supreme Court justice in an election year. The expert's verdict points out that this is more due to the rarity of filling Supreme Court slots rather than a long-standing tradition.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that there is a long tradition of not nominating and confirming a Supreme Court justice in an election year. The expert's verdict provides examples of nominations and confirmations that have occurred in election years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is an established tradition of not nominating and confirming a Supreme Court justice in an election year. The expert's verdict challenges this assumption by highlighting the rarity of such occurrences and the lack of a consistent tradition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the rarity of nominations and confirmations in an election year is not solely due to a tradition but rather the circumstances and dynamics surrounding Supreme Court appointments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been nominations and confirmations of Supreme Court justices in election years, as pointed out by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and variability of Supreme Court nominations and confirmations in election years by presenting it as a straightforward tradition. The expert's verdict highlights the different cases and circumstances that have occurred in the past.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without further information or analysis."}
