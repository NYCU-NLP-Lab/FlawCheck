{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that detainees at Guantanamo Bay received COVID-19 immunizations before many Americans had received their first dose. The expert's verdict clarifies that the immunization plan for detainees was put on hold and it is not known how many, if any, detainees received the vaccine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that detainees received immunizations before many Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that detainees receiving immunizations before Americans is a problem or controversy. The expert's verdict mentions that the controversy arose on the internet and some social media users raised concerns, but it does not provide a clear consensus on whether it is actually problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or context, such as the fact that the immunization plan was put on hold and the Guantanamo Bay facility houses both detainees and personnel who may require vaccinations for operational purposes."}
