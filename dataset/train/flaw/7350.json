{"Contradict fact": "The claim quotes Harriet Tubman as saying something that she never actually said.", "Exaggerate": "The claim attributes freeing \"a thousand slaves\" to Tubman, while historians suggest she personally guided around 70 to 80 people to freedom.", "Lack enough support": "There is no evidence or historical documentation to support the claim that Tubman made the quoted statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that enslaved people did not know they were enslaved, which is contradicted by historical evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The quote has been traced back to a feminist political analyst who used it in a different context during a presidential primary matchup."}
