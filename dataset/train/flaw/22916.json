{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a survey conducted in only three cities and with a limited sample size of 1,100 women aged 18 to 35. The survey does not consider women in rural areas or those who are not working.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the survey results can be generalized to all Nigerian women, which is a problematic assumption according to statisticians and experts. The sample used in the survey should have been more widespread and representative of the entire population.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the prevalence of Nigerian women wearing wigs daily. While the survey reports that 81.8% of respondents owned wigs, it does not necessarily mean that eight out of 10 Nigerian women wear wigs daily, as the claim suggests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the survey was based on a misleading statistic. The widespread news reports about the survey's findings were found to be misleading and not necessarily accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on the reporting of reputable publications without critically examining the methodology and limitations of the survey.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations or consider other factors that may influence the prevalence of Nigerian women wearing wigs daily. It does not explore cultural, social, or economic factors that may contribute to this trend."}
