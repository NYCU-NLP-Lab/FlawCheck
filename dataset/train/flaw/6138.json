{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in job losses between the last three months under President Bush and the last three months under President Obama. The expert's verdict states that the average job losses under Bush were 673,000, while under Obama it was 436,000. The claim does not provide this level of detail and may therefore exaggerate the difference.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the difference in job losses between the two presidents. The expert's verdict states that Hoyer understated the difference between the two presidents. The claim does not provide the exact numbers or the average job losses, so it may not accurately represent the full extent of the difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific numbers or data to back up the comparison between job losses under President Bush and President Obama. The expert's verdict relies on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to support the comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in job losses. The expert's verdict mentions that there are different ways to interpret the numbers and that Hoyer's benchmark difference of 200,000 may not hold true for all month-to-month comparisons. The claim does not acknowledge these alternative explanations."}
