{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the district opened 22 new schools, as the school district's own website states that only 20 new schools were opened.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the new schools in reducing class sizes, as it is mentioned that the new schools did help reduce class sizes district-wide for a time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed up by concrete evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that opening new schools is the only solution to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment, without considering other possible strategies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the district's failure to meet the class size rules every year, such as changes in enrollment or other factors that were not addressed in the claim."}
