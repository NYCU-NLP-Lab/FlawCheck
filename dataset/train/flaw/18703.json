{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the benefits of Bernie Sanders' plan by stating that all student loans will be forgiven and that the individual will have no more student debt.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the individual will only have to pay $450 extra in taxes a month for the next 25 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bernie Sanders' plan will result in complete student loan forgiveness and that the individual will only have to pay extra taxes to achieve this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that could affect the amount of additional taxes an individual would have to pay under Bernie Sanders' plan, but the claim does not consider these possibilities."}
