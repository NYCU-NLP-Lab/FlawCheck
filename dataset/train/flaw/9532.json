{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of Georgians incarcerated in local jails who have never been convicted of a crime, as it is unclear how many of the 64 percent awaiting trial could not pay for bail.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient data and evidence to support the assertion that the majority of incarcerated Georgians are too poor to pay their bail.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the main reason for incarceration in local jails is the inability to pay bail, without considering other factors that may contribute to incarceration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high percentage of people in Georgia jails who are awaiting trial, such as the seriousness of the alleged crimes or other legal factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Georgia state report did not indicate how many people were jailed specifically because they could not afford bail.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear definition of \"never\" in relation to the majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which poverty is the sole determinant of incarceration in local jails, as other factors may also contribute to the situation."}
