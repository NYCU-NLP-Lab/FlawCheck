{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the idea that young people are growing \"horns\" in the base of their skulls from looking down at cellphone screens. The study mentioned in the claim had limitations and did not provide conclusive evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between cellphone use and the growth of \"horns\" without considering other factors that could contribute to the observed phenomenon.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the importance of proper posture and musculoskeletal health in relation to cellphone use. While the study raises concerns about posture and musculoskeletal health, the claim focuses on the sensationalized aspect of \"horns\" rather than the broader implications.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the underlying claim of young people growing \"horns\" from cellphone use is unfounded. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of evidence and the limitations of the study.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its presentation of the research findings, as it fails to mention the limitations and criticisms raised by various publications. It presents the initial reports without acknowledging the subsequent scrutiny and doubts raised.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the observed anatomical feature, such as genetic variations or natural variations in the population. It solely attributes the phenomenon to cellphone use without exploring other possibilities.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the findings by framing it as a widespread issue affecting young people, when the study focused on a specific group experiencing pain and already seeking medical attention. The claim's language of \"growing 'horns'\" also adds a sensationalized element."}
