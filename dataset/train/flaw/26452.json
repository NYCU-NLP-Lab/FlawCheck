{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the omission of the footage showing Trump's statement to supporters on Jan. 6. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the statement was indeed shown during the impeachment trial.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that House Democrats intentionally left out the footage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the omission of the footage was intentional, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the footage was indeed shown during the impeachment trial, contradicting the claim's assertion of intentional omission."}
