{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Trump's support for intervention in Libya by stating that he is \"on record extensively supporting\" it. The evidence provided only shows his support for intervention in specific circumstances and does not necessarily support the claim that he extensively supported it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it only provides one piece of evidence, which is a video of Trump expressing his views on the situation in Libya. More evidence would be needed to fully support the claim that Trump extensively supported intervention in Libya.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's support for intervention in Libya translates to support for the attacks that toppled Gadhafi. However, the evidence provided does not explicitly state that Trump supported the specific actions taken to remove Gadhafi from power.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Trump's support for intervention in Libya was based on humanitarian concerns and the desire to stop the killing of innocent people, rather than a specific endorsement of the attacks that took place.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Clinton stated there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action during the NBC News forum. This suggests that Trump's support for intervention in Libya may not have been as extensive as the claim suggests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of Trump's stance on intervention in Libya. It only provides one instance of his support and does not consider any potential changes or inconsistencies in his position over time."}
