{"Understate": "The claim may understate the genetic similarity between dogs and wolves by simply stating that they are \"99.9% identical.\" The expert's verdict provides more detailed information, stating that the similarity is actually 99.96% in terms of nuclear coding-DNA sequence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement that dogs and wolves are genetically 99.9% identical. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides multiple scientific studies and findings that support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the genetic similarity between dogs and wolves is the only factor in determining their relationship. The expert's verdict mentions that there is still some debate about the appropriate classification for domestic dogs, with some arguing that they should be their own distinct species.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the genetic similarity between dogs and wolves. The expert's verdict mentions that the split between these two canid lineages likely occurred between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago, and that domestic dogs are likely the descendants of a now extinct descendant of grey wolves. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the genetic similarities observed."}
