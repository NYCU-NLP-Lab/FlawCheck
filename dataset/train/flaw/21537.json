{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Joe Straus' rating by NARAL as 100% in both 2005 and 2007, when in reality, his rating was 45% in 2005 and the validity of the 2007 rating is questioned.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the claim of Joe Straus receiving a 100% rating by NARAL in 2005 and 2007.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a 100% rating by NARAL indicates a pro-choice stance without considering other factors or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the 2007 rating, as it is suggested that Straus did not even vote on the amendment that NARAL's scorecard cites for his \"100\" rating."}
