{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Bernie Sanders' support for Ayatollah Khomeini against the US, his condemnation of President Carter for imperialism, and his accusation that the hostages were CIA spies.", "Lack enough support": "There is no evidence to support the claim that Bernie Sanders expressed these beliefs or took a stance regarding the hostage crisis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bernie Sanders' affiliation with the Socialist Workers Party means he supported Iran during the hostage crisis, which is not supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that Bernie Sanders, while affiliated with the Socialist Workers Party, had some differences with the party and did not hold the beliefs attributed to him in the claim."}
