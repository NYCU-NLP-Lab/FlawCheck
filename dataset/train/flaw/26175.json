{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the proposed tax by stating it as a \"5-cent tax per text message\" when in reality it would have been based on a percentage of a cell phone user's monthly bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed tax would go towards funding free phones for undocumented immigrants, which is not accurate. The funds would have been used for public-purpose programs that provide phone service for lower-income residents as well as for deaf and disabled residents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the tax money would go towards free phones for undocumented immigrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the proposed tax, such as the need for revenue to fund programs that provide phone service for lower-income and disabled residents."}
