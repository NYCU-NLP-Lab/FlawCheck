{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of renewable energy on the closure of the Monticello power plant. While renewable energy may have played a role in the decision, it was not the sole or primary cause.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the closure of the Monticello power plant was solely due to renewable energy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closure of the Monticello power plant is evidence of the failure of renewable energy, without considering other factors such as market conditions and competition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the closure of the Monticello power plant, which is the impact of low power prices, oversupplied renewable generation market, and low natural gas prices."}
