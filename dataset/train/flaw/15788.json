{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the proposed changes by suggesting that gender-specific language would be completely banned, eliminated, or removed from use in the U.S. House of Representatives, when in reality it is limited to a single document and does not restrict the use of gender-specific language in other aspects of House business.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that gender-specific language would be banned, eliminated, or removed. The expert's verdict provides multiple sources and statements that clarify the actual proposal made by Pelosi and other Democrats.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed changes would have a significant impact on the use of gender-specific terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, without considering the limited scope of the proposal and its specific application to the rules of the House.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or interpretations of the proposed changes, such as the intention to promote gender-neutral language and inclusivity rather than outright elimination of gender-specific terms."}
