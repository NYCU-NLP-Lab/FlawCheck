{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Gov. Chris Christie's spending cuts by stating that he \"cut spending (by) $1 billion,\" when in reality, the decrease in spending was from the Legislature's approved budget, not from the previous year's budget.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Gov. Chris Christie's education funding by stating that he provided \"$850 million in new education funding,\" when in reality, the increase in education funding was about $863 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully back up the statement that Gov. Chris Christie \"cut spending (by) $1 billion.\" While it is technically correct that he reduced the budget by that amount, the context of the overall budget increase in subsequent years is not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spending cuts made by Gov. Chris Christie are solely responsible for the increased education funding. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the increased funding was made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth and projected revenue growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increased education funding, such as the role of revenue growth and other factors beyond Gov. Chris Christie's actions."}
