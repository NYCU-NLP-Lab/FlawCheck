{"Contradict fact": "The claim that members of the U.S. Congress were initially paid on a per diem basis to prevent them from raising their own salaries is contradicted by the U.S. Constitution, which states that they shall receive compensation for their services to be determined by law.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by suggesting that the per diem basis was solely intended to prevent legislators from raising their own salaries. The expert's explanation highlights that the U.S. Constitution allowed Congress to determine the manner and amount of compensation, indicating that there may have been additional factors involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the per diem payment method was specifically implemented to prevent legislators from increasing their own salaries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the per diem payment method was solely motivated by preventing legislators from raising their own salaries. However, the expert's analysis suggests that there may have been other considerations and factors involved in determining the compensation method.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation by highlighting that the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the authority to determine the compensation method, suggesting that there may have been multiple reasons for choosing the per diem basis initially."}
