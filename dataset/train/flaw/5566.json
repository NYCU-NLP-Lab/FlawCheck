{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict identifies that Sen. Tom Coburn overstated the decline in violent crimes in national parks after the gun ban was lifted. The actual decrease was 12 percent, not the claimed 85 percent.", "Contradict fact": "The original claim by Sen. Coburn contradicts the fact that murders actually increased between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what he stated.", "Lack enough support": "The original claim lacks sufficient support as it only provides a before-and-after statistic without considering other factors or providing a comprehensive analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in violent crimes is solely attributed to the lifting of the gun ban, without considering other potential factors or variables.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sen. Coburn misspoke and provided incorrect information regarding the decline in violent incidents, indicating that the claim falters in terms of accuracy.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the decline in crime rates, and that attributing it solely to the gun ban may not be the most accurate conclusion.", "Understate": "The original claim may understate the actual increase in murders between 2008 and 2011, as it only mentions a general decline in violent crimes without specifying the specific increase in murders."}
