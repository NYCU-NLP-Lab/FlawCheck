{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol due to COVID-19.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or data to support the assertion that more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol due to COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between COVID-19 and increased dependence on drugs or alcohol without considering other factors that could contribute to such dependence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported increases in drug and alcohol use during the pandemic, such as changes in reporting or access to treatment.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its use of terminology, as \"dependence\" is not the same as \"addiction,\" and the two conditions can overlap."}
