{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a study done by the Milken Institute, but the specific details and methodology of the study are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that by reducing chronic health care costs in Georgia, the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs can be reduced. This assumption may not hold true as there could be other factors contributing to the economic costs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a study from 2007, which may not accurately reflect the current situation in Georgia.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the actual economic impact of chronic diseases in Georgia as it only focuses on seven specific diseases and may not account for other health conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the $32.8 billion lost each year, such as factors unrelated to chronic health care costs, which are not considered in the claim."}
