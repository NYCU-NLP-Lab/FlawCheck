{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who would have immediately benefited from President Obama's executive action being affirmed. The expert's analysis provides information on the number of people eligible for different immigration programs, which suggests that the claim's estimate may be inflated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that 220,000 New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted. The expert's analysis provides estimates of eligible individuals for different immigration programs, but it does not directly support the claim's specific number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all unauthorized immigrants in New York City would have benefited from President Obama's executive action being affirmed. The expert's analysis highlights specific eligibility criteria for different programs, indicating that not all unauthorized immigrants would have been eligible.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the rights and opportunities of New Yorkers were taken away by the Supreme Court. The expert's analysis provides information on the different immigration programs and their eligibility criteria, suggesting that the Supreme Court ruling may not be the sole factor impacting individuals' rights and opportunities.", "Contradict fact": "No contradicting facts were identified in the provided claim."}
