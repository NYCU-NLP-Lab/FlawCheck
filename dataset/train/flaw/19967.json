{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that earmarks requested in a federal spending bill included $277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin. It only mentions that an earmark request for $300,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin was made by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau), but it does not provide any further information or evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that voters turned Democrats out of office in Washington because they were turned off by their spending, but it acknowledges that the results were more complicated than that. This assumption may oversimplify the reasons for the election results and may not be fully supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict questions whether an outgoing Democratic congressman would make a special federal funding request for potato pests in Wisconsin just weeks after his party got clobbered in the elections. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the earmark request, such as political motivations or strategic considerations.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim that the earmarks are not likely to be funded. It states that the 1,900-page, $8 billion bill that included the earmarks was abandoned by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, which implies that the earmarks may not be funded.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not appear to exaggerate any aspect of the claim.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not appear to understate any aspect of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not appear to falter at any specific point in relation to the claim."}
