{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Joe Biden is proposing the \"largest tax increase in American history\" is an exaggeration according to the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden's tax increase would be the largest in American history without considering other historical tax increases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Biden's tax proposal would be the fifth largest tax increase since 1940, not the largest in American history."}
