{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the lawyers for the Obama Administration, suggesting that they \"officially admit\" the birth certificate is fake, when in reality, the lawyer stated that the online birth certificate was \"legally irrelevant\" in the context of the challenge.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the birth certificate is fake. It only refers to a lawsuit challenging Obama's eligibility and quotes a lawyer's statement about the online birth certificate being legally irrelevant.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by the lawyer during the hearing implies that the birth certificate is fake, without providing any direct evidence or basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or interpretations of the lawyer's statement, such as the argument that the online birth certificate is not legally relevant in the specific context of the challenge.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a clear and accurate representation of the lawyer's statement, leading to a distorted understanding of the situation."}
