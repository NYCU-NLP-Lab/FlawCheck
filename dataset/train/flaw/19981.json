{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the level of control the Border Patrol had over the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010. The claim states that only 6.5 percent of the border was under full control, while the expert's verdict reveals that 44 percent of the border was under \"operational control,\" including 129 miles at the highest level of security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that only 6.5 percent of the border was under full control. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information and data from the GAO report, which contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that more border security is needed based on the assertion that only 6.5 percent of the border was under full control. However, the expert's verdict reveals that different levels of security were in place, and the highest level of control was deemed necessary only in specific high-traffic corridors and urban areas.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the level of control the Border Patrol had over the U.S.-Mexico border. The expert's verdict explains that the level of control varied based on the specific areas and their characteristics, such as high-traffic corridors and urban areas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 44 percent of the border was under \"operational control\" in 2010, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim's assertion of only 6.5 percent of the border being under full control is not supported by the available evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of control over the U.S.-Mexico border by stating that only 6.5 percent was under full control. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced understanding of the different levels of security and control that were in place.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the level of control the Border Patrol had over the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010. The expert's verdict clarifies the different levels of security and provides a more accurate assessment."}
