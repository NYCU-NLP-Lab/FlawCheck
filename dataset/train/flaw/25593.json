{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that not issuing a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline would immediately reduce prices at the pump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline would directly and immediately lead to a reduction in prices at the pump, without considering other factors that influence gas prices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fluctuation of gas prices, such as the cost of crude oil and increased imports from unreliable sources.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential long-term economic benefits and job creation associated with the Keystone XL pipeline by focusing solely on immediate price reduction at the pump.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, which states that the cost of crude oil is the single biggest factor in the price of gasoline, not the approval or denial of the Keystone XL pipeline permit.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the immediate impact of the Keystone XL pipeline on reducing prices at the pump, without considering potential delays in construction and the time it takes for the pipeline to become operational."}
