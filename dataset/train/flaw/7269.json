{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the campaign contributions on Chris Koster's actions as attorney general, suggesting that he \"fell silent\" solely because of the donations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the direct causation between the campaign contributions and Koster's decision to stop pursuing the case against Backpage.com.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the campaign contributions from people affiliated with the service influenced Koster's actions, without providing concrete evidence of a direct connection.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Koster ceased efforts against Backpage.com, such as changes in legal strategy, lack of jurisdiction, or other factors not related to campaign contributions."}
