{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"99 percent of all new income today (is) going to the top 1 percent.\" While the claim is supported by some data, it may be overstating the extent of income inequality.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement. Although it references studies by economists such as Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, the specific data and methodology used to arrive at the 99 percent figure are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transfer of income to the top 1 percent is solely due to wealth and income inequality, without considering other potential factors such as changes in tax policies or economic shifts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of income, such as the impact of globalization, technological advancements, or changes in the labor market.", "Falters at times": "While the claim is supported by some evidence and studies, it may falter at times due to the lack of comprehensive data and the potential for other factors influencing income distribution.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the income inequality issue."}
