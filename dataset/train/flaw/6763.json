{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order does not ban the sale of car seats.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that initial confusion about the order led to some Michigan Walmart stores mistakenly prohibiting the sale of car seats.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that people in Michigan are banned from purchasing a new baby car seat in stores.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the executive order from Gov. Whitmer includes a ban on purchasing car seats, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the temporary bans on the sale of car seats in some stores were a result of misinterpretation of the executive order."}
