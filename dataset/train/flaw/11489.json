{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the percentage of people who said they were coming because they had been promised amnesty. The expert's verdict mentions that 95 percent of people surveyed said this, but it is unclear if this is an accurate representation of the overall population crossing the border.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the statement that 95 percent of people surveyed said they were coming because they had been promised amnesty. The expert's verdict mentions a document summarizing interviews with 230 adults and children, but it does not provide the full details or methodology of the survey.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for the increase in people crossing the border is solely due to the promise of amnesty. However, the expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations, such as people fleeing violence and crime in their home countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for why people are crossing the border, such as fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. This indicates that the claim may not consider all possible factors contributing to the increase in border crossings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the word \"amnesty\" does not appear in the summary of results from the survey mentioned by the expert's verdict. This suggests that the claim may be misrepresenting or misinterpreting the survey data.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may be understating the complexity of the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border by attributing the increase in border crossings solely to the promise of amnesty. The expert's verdict mentions other factors, such as violence and crime, that may also contribute to the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the reasons for the increase in border crossings. The expert's verdict highlights the lack of clarity and confirmation regarding the document summarizing the survey, indicating potential inconsistencies or uncertainties in the claim's evidence."}
