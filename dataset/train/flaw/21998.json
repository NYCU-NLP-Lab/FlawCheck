{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the Democrats' stance on border security and their desire to get rid of ICE. The expert's verdict clarifies that Democrats are not advocating for open borders and that the small minority calling for the abolishment of ICE want its functions redistributed to other existing government agencies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Democrats are not advocating for open borders and that none of them have called for abandoning border enforcement. The expert's verdict provides evidence to support this contradiction.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Democrats want to have no borders and get rid of ICE.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that all Democrats want to have no borders and get rid of ICE, which is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation, and the expert's verdict does not offer one either."}
