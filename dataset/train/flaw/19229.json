{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the Indonesian student is famous internationally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the student's participation in a mass rally and holding an Indonesian flag automatically makes them famous internationally, which may not be the case.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that four out of the five photos provided are doctored versions of unrelated images, suggesting that the claim itself is false.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the student's fame by stating that they are \"internationally famous\" based on limited evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and convincing argument for the student's international fame, as it relies on manipulated images and lacks substantial proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the student's participation in the mass rally and holding the Indonesian flag, such as a personal or local significance rather than international fame.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the manipulated images and their impact on the credibility of the claim."}
