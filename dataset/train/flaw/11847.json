{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not related to the protest against the citizenship law in Delhi's Seelampur, as it has been circulating online since January 2018 in reports about a protest against the release of a Bollywood film in Gurugram city.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that protesters attacked the school bus, when in reality, the video shows distressed children taking shelter between seats with broken windows.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading Facebook post and does not provide any credible evidence to support the assertion that protesters attacked the school bus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is related to the demonstration against the citizenship law in Delhi's Seelampur, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, which suggests that it is related to a protest against the release of a Bollywood film, rather than the demonstration against the citizenship law."}
