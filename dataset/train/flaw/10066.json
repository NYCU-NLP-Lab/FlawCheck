{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they searched for evidence of Lee Fisher saying the quote but could not find any. This suggests that there is a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that Fisher's support for gun control has been used against him, but it does not necessarily mean that he said the specific quote in question. This assumption is problematic as it assumes that the quote is true without concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Fisher has expressed support for gun control measures such as background checks and assault-weapons bans. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for his stance on gun control, rather than simply saying he \"never met a gun control bill he didn't like.\"", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that they could not find any evidence of Fisher saying the quote. This indicates that the claim may be contradicting the fact that the quote was actually said by Fisher.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the quote is \"slightly plausible\" based on Fisher's positions on gun control. This suggests that the claim may be understating the potential validity of the quote.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the NRA did not follow up on their request to dig into their research archives for evidence of the quote. This suggests that the claim may falter at times in terms of the available evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any exaggeration in the claim."}
