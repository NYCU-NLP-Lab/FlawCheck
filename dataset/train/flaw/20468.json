{"Understate": "The claim may understate the chances of throwing a pass in a two-point conversion situation, as the expert's verdict mentions that the passing success rate is 48 percent, which is considered good.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that throwing a pass is a better option for a two-point conversion, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that rushing the ball has a higher success rate (53 percent) since 2012.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"your chances of throwing it are actually a little bit better in that situation.\" The expert's verdict provides statistics on passing and rushing success rates, but it does not directly address the specific situation mentioned in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that rushing the ball could have been a viable option, as the expert's verdict mentions that the Eagles had successfully run the ball three times for a two-point conversion earlier in the season."}
