{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the anti-business litigation climate on employers' expansion decisions. The expert's verdict mentions that Wisconsin is generally rated middle of the pack or better in legal-climate surveys, suggesting that the claim may overstate the negative impact.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the national surveys provided by Governor Walker do not provide state-specific results or rank concerns about the litigation climate against other factors. This lack of specific data for Wisconsin weakens the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the anti-business litigation climate is one of the most important factors affecting employers' expansion decisions. However, this assumption is not backed up by specific data or rankings, making it problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for employers' expansion decisions that are not solely related to the litigation climate. The claim does not consider or acknowledge these alternative factors, indicating a bias towards a single explanation.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Walker sounded defensive when signing the lawsuit-reform bill, suggesting that the claim may falter in presenting a strong and unbiased argument.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that Wisconsin is generally rated middle of the pack or better in legal-climate surveys, while the claim implies that the anti-business litigation climate is a significant issue."}
