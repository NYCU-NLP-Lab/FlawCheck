The expert's analysis suggests that the data is incomplete and may not accurately represent the overall impact of Obamacare on insurance coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the data, such as the exclusion of the big surge in insurance signups that occurred during the first quarter of 2014 from the U.S. Census Bureau's annual figures.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on data compiled by the private sector, which has a less certain historical track record compared to the Census data.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict fact as the expert's analysis suggests that the data for new signups and cancellations is uncertain and lacks a consistent historical track record."}
