{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of plunging demand for cheese, butter, and other dairy products on the shortage of milk in grocery stores.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that fluid milk production limitations are the sole reason for milk dumping and the shortage in grocery stores.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that shifting production from school products to grocery store ones is a simple solution, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the milk dumping and shortage, such as the change in consumer demand and the inability of factories to adapt quickly to the new demand.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that grocery store dairy shelves remain sparse while dairy farmers are forced to dump thousands of pounds of milk."}
