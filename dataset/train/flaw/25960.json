{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the World Health Organization's stance on wearing masks, stating that they are now saying no masks are necessary, which is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that the WHO is now saying masks are not needed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the WHO's statement about masks not being enough on their own means they are saying masks are not necessary, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the WHO's statement, such as the importance of multiple measures (masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene) in controlling the spread of the virus."}
