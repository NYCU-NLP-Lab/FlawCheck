{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that North Carolina is home to two of the top five \"most polluted\" rivers in the U.S.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the pollution levels of the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers by stating they are among the top five most polluted rivers in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to prove that the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers are among the top five most polluted rivers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a specific \"most polluted rivers\" list that ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers among the top five.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the pollution in the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers, such as the improper dumping of chemicals by the Chemours plant."}
