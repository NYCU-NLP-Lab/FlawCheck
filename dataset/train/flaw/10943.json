{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the per enrollee cost of Medicaid in Rhode Island by stating that it is 60 percent higher than the national average. The expert's analysis shows that Rhode Island actually ranks second in per enrollee spending, but the difference is not as large as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement about Rhode Island having the second highest per enrollee cost of Medicaid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the higher per enrollee cost in Rhode Island, such as differences in healthcare infrastructure, population demographics, or specific healthcare needs of the state's population. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing accurate or up-to-date information. The expert's analysis shows that the claim is based on data from the 2011 fiscal year, which may not reflect the current situation accurately.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high per enrollee cost of Medicaid in Rhode Island is a result of inefficiency or mismanagement. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to the cost, such as higher healthcare costs in the state or specific healthcare needs of the population.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the issue by not fully acknowledging the actual ranking of Rhode Island in per enrollee Medicaid spending. While it is not the highest, it still ranks second, which is significant.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rhode Island ranks fifth, not second, in per enrollee Medicaid spending when using a different calculation method. This discrepancy undermines the accuracy of the claim."}
