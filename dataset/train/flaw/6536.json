{"Understate": "The claim understates the protections that exist for workers discussing pay, as there are federal and state laws in place that make it illegal for employers to retaliate against employees for discussing pay.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that retaliation for discussing pay is legal in most places.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that retaliation for discussing pay is legal in most places, without considering the existing laws and protections in place.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that retaliation for discussing pay may be illegal in many places due to federal and state laws protecting workers' rights to engage in \"concerted activity\" and discuss their pay."}
