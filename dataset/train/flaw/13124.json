{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Hillary Clinton's stance on refugees by suggesting that she is \"letting so many people into our country\" without proper vetting, based on twisted excerpts from her speeches.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's concern about vetting refugees in Jordan and Turkey implies that she is allowing unvetted refugees into the United States, which is a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Clinton is \"letting so many people into our country\" without proper vetting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Clinton has advocated for careful screening and vetting processes for admitting Syrian refugees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that Clinton's concern about vetting refugees in Jordan and Turkey is related to those countries' ability to handle the influx of refugees, rather than suggesting that ISIS could infiltrate the United States through refugees."}
