{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama signed an executive order commissioning pastor Rob Bell to write a \"gender neutral Bible.\" The source article mentions that Bell was commissioned to create a gender-neutral version of the Bible, but it does not mention an executive order or the involvement of President Obama.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Obama's executive order was related to his demands for gender-neutral bathrooms in public schools. However, this connection is not supported by any evidence or statement from President Obama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any evidence or additional sources to back up the statement that President Obama signed an executive order commissioning pastor Rob Bell.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the source article is from a section of the Christian Post website called BuzzVine, which is stated to be a platform for community writers and does not reflect the editorial policy or stance of the Christian Post.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by including quotes from President Obama that are presented as real but are actually part of a satirical article.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the claim is a misinterpretation or fabrication based on the source article from BuzzVine."}
