{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of absentee ballots with impossible or extraordinary return dates, as the expert's verdict states that there were only about 10,000 ballots received in the three-day period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the absentee ballots have impossible or extraordinary return dates. It is based on a post from a pro-Trump media outlet, which may not provide reliable information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absentee ballots with unusual return dates raise serious questions about their legitimacy. However, the expert's verdict explains that the extended deadline for mail-in ballots was authorized by a state Supreme Court ruling.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests alternative explanations for the absentee ballots with unusual return dates, such as the extension of the deadline by the state Supreme Court and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on voting methods.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it is not unusual for ballot counting to be suspended late on election night, and that mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day were allowed to be counted in several states, including Pennsylvania.", "Understate": "There is no indication of any understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times bias in this case."}
