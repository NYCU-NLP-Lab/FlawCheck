{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of FEMA by stating that they would only provide aid to victims if they had received unspecified vaccinations. This is not supported by any evidence and is proven to be false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks any evidence or credible sources to support the statement that FEMA required vaccinations for aid.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that FEMA was implementing a vaccination requirement for aid, without any basis or evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that FEMA has explicitly stated that there is no requirement for hurricane survivors to be vaccinated in order to receive assistance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim is part of a larger conspiracy theory regarding FEMA and the government's supposed plans for concentration camps and martial law. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim is not based on factual information but rather on unfounded conspiracy theories."}
