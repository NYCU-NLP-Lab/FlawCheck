{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island's sales tax. This is because the expert points out that the figure provided by Henchman is based on a different measurement (percent of total personal spending) than the one used by Mikesell (percent of total personal income captured by sales tax).", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the narrowness of Rhode Island's sales tax base is the reason for its high sales tax rate. However, the expert questions this assumption and suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the high rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to validate the 25 percent figure. The expert highlights the difficulty in accurately determining the total amount of retail sales in the state, which is necessary to calculate the percentage of personal spending subject to sales tax.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the relationship between Rhode Island's sales tax rate and the breadth of its tax base. The expert points out that the high sales tax rate is not solely due to the narrowness of the tax base, indicating that the claim may oversimplify the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rhode Island's high sales tax rate. The expert suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the high rate, aside from the narrowness of the tax base.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rhode Island's sales tax is limited to tangible goods and exempted items, as mentioned by the expert. The claim implies that only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to sales tax, whereas the expert explains the various categories of exempted items.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of determining the percentage of personal spending subject to sales tax. The expert highlights the challenges in accurately tracking sales that are not taxed, indicating that the claim may not fully acknowledge these difficulties."}
