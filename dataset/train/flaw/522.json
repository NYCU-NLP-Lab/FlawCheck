{"Falters at times": "The claim that Eric Hovde \"refused to pay his property taxes until he was taken to court\" falters at times because it does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the situation. The claim fails to mention that Hovde's firm had been paying lower property taxes based on the properties being classified for farming rather than some other type of usage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence to back up the accusation that Hovde refused to pay his property taxes. The evidence provided in the form of documents related to the lawsuit does not clearly demonstrate a refusal to pay taxes but rather a dispute over the classification and assessment of the properties.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Hovde's settlement of the lawsuit implies guilt or wrongdoing. The evidence provided suggests that the settlement was a resolution to the dispute and does not necessarily indicate any intentional refusal to pay taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that Hovde \"refused to pay his property taxes.\" The evidence provided suggests that Hovde's firm had been paying lower property taxes based on the classification of the properties as farmland, and the dispute arose from the city seeking penalties due to the land not being used for farming. This alternative explanation challenges the notion of a deliberate refusal to pay taxes."}
