{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Donald Trump has eliminated the Johnson Amendment. While he signed an executive order to empower religious leaders to speak up politically, he does not have the constitutional authority to eliminate the law entirely.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Trump has completely gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment. It is misleading and does not provide evidence or facts to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that religious leaders were not able to speak up politically before Trump's executive order. However, experts state that religious leaders have been speaking up politically despite the legal restrictions imposed by the Johnson Amendment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for Trump's claim. While he signed an executive order to empower religious leaders, he also acknowledges the need for Congress to permanently eliminate the Johnson Amendment. This suggests that his executive order alone does not fully eliminate the law."}
