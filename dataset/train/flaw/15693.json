{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by implying that it shows a 5G transmission tower deliberately set on fire out of anger. The expert's verdict clarifies that the fire was most likely caused by a short circuit and not related to actions against 5G.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that the fire was a result of anger towards 5G.
