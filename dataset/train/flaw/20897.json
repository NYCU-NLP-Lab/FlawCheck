{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because the expert mentions that a peer-reviewed study only covered the timeframe from 2010 to 2016, not from 2000 to 2016 as claimed by Casten.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the development of major drugs during the period mentioned, such as private funding or contributions from other government agencies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it misrepresents the timeframe for which the claim is made, as pointed out by the expert.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that every major drug introduced from 2000 to 2016 came out of NIH funding, as the peer-reviewed study only covers the period from 2010 to 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that NIH funding was the sole or primary source for the development of every major drug during the specified period, which may be a problematic assumption."}
