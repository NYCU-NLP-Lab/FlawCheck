{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the certainty of individuals keeping their health insurance by stating \"you will keep your health insurance.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that this claim is not entirely accurate, as there are projections of a decline in employer-based coverage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement. The expert's verdict provides information from the Congressional Budget Office and other independent estimates that suggest a decline in health insurance coverage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care law will only make insurance more secure and affordable for those who already have it. However, the expert's verdict highlights projections of a decline in coverage, suggesting that the assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations by presenting projections and estimates from different sources that contradict the claim. This suggests that there are alternative explanations to the claim's assertion that individuals will keep their health insurance."}
