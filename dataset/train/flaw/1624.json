{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the connection between formaldehyde in vaccines and childhood leukemia by stating it as a definitive link.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or studies to support the connection between formaldehyde in vaccines and childhood leukemia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the formaldehyde used as a vaccine preservative is directly linked to childhood leukemia without providing substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations, such as the trace level of formaldehyde in vaccines being safe and the presence of higher natural levels of formaldehyde in the body.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the Australian Cancer Council spokesperson, who states that there is \"no evidence\" of a connection between childhood leukemia and formaldehyde in vaccines.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the safety of the trace level of formaldehyde in vaccines by not acknowledging the scientific consensus that it is within safe thresholds.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the expert's verdict does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim.", "No bias identified": "No bias of \"Falters at times\" was found in the provided claim."}
