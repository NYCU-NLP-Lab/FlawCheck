{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or information to support its validity. The accompanying photograph's origin, location, and context are unclear, making it difficult to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman in the photograph was subjected to a severe flogging for being caught with a can of beer in Iran. However, there is no concrete evidence or confirmation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The photograph has been used in various contexts and attached to different claims, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the woman's condition. It is possible that the photograph does not depict a punishment for alcohol consumption but rather a different situation, such as an illness, injury, or accident."}
