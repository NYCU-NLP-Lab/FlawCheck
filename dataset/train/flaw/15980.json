Harry Reid is involved in a scheme to sell land to the Chinese and is using federal violence to achieve that goal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sen. Harry Reid's endorsement of federal action against Bundy is solely for personal gain and to facilitate land sales to the Chinese, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for Sen.

Harry Reid's son and the Bureau of Land Management to Chinese interests without sufficient evidence.", "": ""}
