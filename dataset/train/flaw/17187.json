{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"21% of people are having serious adverse events from the Moderna vaccine\" is an exaggeration. The actual data from Moderna's submission to the FDA shows that only 0.5% of people had a serious adverse reaction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that 21% of people are experiencing serious adverse events.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Moderna's data shows a much lower rate of serious adverse reactions (0.5%) than the claimed 21%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 21% figure is accurate and applicable to the current dosage of the Moderna vaccine, without providing any evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an inaccurate and misleading statistic that is significantly higher than the actual data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the preliminary safety assessment mentioned in the expert's verdict found a 21% rate of systemic reactions at a higher dosage (250 micrograms), but this study did not identify any trial-limiting safety concerns and the current dosage (100 micrograms) did not result in any serious reactions."}
