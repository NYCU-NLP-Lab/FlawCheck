{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in assisting the terrorists who carried out the September 11 attacks by stating that he assisted in the clandestine travel of 10 out of the 12 terrorists, when in fact there were a total of 19 hijackers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani knowingly aided al Qaeda in carrying out the 9/11 attacks. The 9/11 Commission Report found no evidence of Iran's involvement or prior knowledge of the terrorist organization's plans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Iran permitted members of al Qaeda, including some of the 9/11 hijackers, to travel through Iran to Afghanistan, it means that Soleimani knowingly aided them in carrying out the attacks. However, there is no direct evidence supporting this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the State Department document referred to in support of the claim states that Iran, not Soleimani, permitted the travel of al Qaeda members. This suggests that the responsibility lies with the Iranian government as a whole, rather than solely with Soleimani."}
