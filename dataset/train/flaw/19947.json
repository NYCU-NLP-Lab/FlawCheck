{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Covid-19 dusk-to-dawn curfew is Kenya's first ever nationwide curfew since independence, when in fact there have been previous instances of regional and city-wide curfews.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement that the curfew is the first ever nationwide curfew since independence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the curfew is the first of its kind without considering previous instances of curfews during emergencies or security operations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as it is mentioned that the curfew during the Covid-19 pandemic is the first nationwide curfew put in place since independence, but there have been curfews declared before under different circumstances, such as during the shifta war and operations against the al-Shabaab terror group."}
