{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a Department of Education in Wisconsin, which is not accurate. This assumption undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between the Department of Corrections budget and the Department of Education budget. Without concrete figures or sources, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "While the claim suggests that the Department of Corrections budget is higher than the Department of Education budget, the expert's verdict states that the overall UW budget is significantly larger than corrections. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Judge Karofsky may have misspoke and intended to refer to \"Higher Education\" instead of the non-existent \"Department of Education.\" This suggests that the claim may have faltered or been inaccurately presented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the state of Wisconsin funds education through three avenues, including the Department of Public Instruction, the University of Wisconsin system, and the Wisconsin technical college system. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's oversimplification of the education budget.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the overall budget and funding allocated to the UW system, as it only focuses on the comparison between the Department of Corrections and Department of Education budgets.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim suggests that the Department of Corrections budget is significantly higher than the Department of Education budget, the expert's verdict states that the overall UW budget remains significantly larger than corrections. This indicates a potential exaggeration in the claim's presentation of the budget comparison."}
