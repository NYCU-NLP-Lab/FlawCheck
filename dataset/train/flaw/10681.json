{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the Arizona immigration law \"expressly bans racial profiling\" contradicts the fact that there have been conflicting court rulings regarding the constitutionality of racial profiling under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or legal analysis to support the assertion that the law expressly bans racial profiling.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of the word \"solely\" from the law's phrasing completely eliminates the possibility of racial profiling, which is a problematic assumption given the history of conflicting court rulings on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as critics argue that the law still allows officers to single out racial or ethnic characteristics to justify interrogations, despite the removal of the word \"solely\" from the provision."}
