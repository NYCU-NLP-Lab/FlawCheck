{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential impact of superdelegates in determining the nominee by stating that they have never been a determining factor since their introduction in 1984. The expert's analysis suggests that superdelegates did play a role in the nomination process in 1984, although the extent of their power is debated among experts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that superdelegates have never been a determining factor in selecting the nominee. The expert's analysis provides historical context and examples but does not conclusively prove or disprove the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of superdelegates is solely to prevent party activists from running against better-known and well-established individuals at the district level. However, the expert's analysis suggests that the purpose of superdelegates was also to address the Democratic Party's desire for candidates more likely to win general elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the role and impact of superdelegates. The expert's analysis highlights the potential influence of superdelegates in swing races and the ability of superdelegates to vote for whichever candidate they choose at the convention.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that superdelegates did play a role in the nomination process in 1984, as mentioned by the expert's analysis. While the claim states that superdelegates have never been a determining factor, the expert's analysis suggests otherwise.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the lack of influence of superdelegates by stating that they have never been a determining factor since their introduction. The expert's analysis suggests that while superdelegates may not have been necessary to settle a nomination in elections after 1984, they did play a role in the 1984 nomination of Walter Mondale."}
