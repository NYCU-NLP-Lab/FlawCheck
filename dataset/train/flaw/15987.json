{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of states that have abolished electrocution by stating that \"85 percent of the states\" have abolished it, when in fact, it is only 85 percent of the states that previously allowed electrocution.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 85 percent of the states have abolished electrocution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the abolition of electrocution in other states is relevant to the discussion about Virginia's potential use of the electric chair.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for why some states have abolished electrocution, such as changes in public opinion or legal challenges, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are still four states (Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina, and Florida) that allow electrocutions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear definition of what it means for a state to have \"abolished\" electrocution."}
