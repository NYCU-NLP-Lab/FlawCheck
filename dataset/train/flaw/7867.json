{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"that number is going up.\" It only mentions the increase in the minority share of the electorate in 2012 and 2016 without providing further data or projections for the future.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the minority share of the electorate is solely due to the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, without considering other factors that may have contributed to this trend.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not differentiating between eligible voters and actual voter turnout, which are two separate measures. It only focuses on the eligible voter population.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in the minority share of the electorate by stating that it was \"slightly more\" than in 2004, without providing the exact percentage increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the minority share of the electorate, such as changes in demographics or voter registration efforts."}
