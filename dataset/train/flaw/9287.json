{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential harm to the economy caused by rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Louise Slaughter claimed ending the policy could cost New York more than $2.5 billion, but it does not provide enough evidence or context to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to fully substantiate the assertion that ending DACA will harm the economy. While the expert's verdict mentions estimates of potential economic losses, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or present alternative viewpoints.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ending DACA will harm the economy without considering potential alternative explanations or factors that could influence economic outcomes. It does not explore other possible consequences or benefits of ending the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the economic impact of ending DACA. It does not address potential counterarguments or consider other policies or factors that may influence the economy.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the potential economic impact of ending DACA. It relies on statements and estimates from different sources without thoroughly examining the underlying assumptions or methodologies.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the potential harm to the economy caused by rescinding DACA. It focuses on the estimated economic losses and emphasizes the negative consequences.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not seem to contradict any established facts. It presents estimates and viewpoints without directly contradicting any verifiable information."}
