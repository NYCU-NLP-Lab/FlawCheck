{"Understate": "The claim may understate the frequency of retirement grade determinations conducted for officers previously retired from the U.S. armed forces, as it suggests that such determinations are rare.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that retirement grade determinations are rare for retired officers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative reasons or circumstances for the rarity of retirement grade determinations for retired officers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rarity of retirement grade determinations for retired officers is unusual or noteworthy, without providing a clear basis for comparison or context.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear whether the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the provided information mainly focuses on the defense of General Petraeus and does not provide comprehensive data on retirement grade determinations for other officers."}
