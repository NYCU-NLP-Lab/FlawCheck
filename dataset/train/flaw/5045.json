{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as an 'experiment'.

However, the expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as an 'experiment'. The expert's verdict also does not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no law requiring the separation of families under the Trump administration, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim implies that Trump was preventing kids from going to jail by ordering the separation, which is not accurate.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the detention of illegal Mexican kids under the Obama administration. The expert's verdict does not offer an alternative explanation either."}
