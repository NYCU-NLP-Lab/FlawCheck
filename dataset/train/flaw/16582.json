{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that the US had 2 percent of the global market for advanced batteries when Obama started, and it is now heading to 40 percent by 2015. The actual figure provided by the expert's verdict is that the US had a 2 percent share of batteries supplied in 2008 and a projection of up to 40 percent by 2015.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the US currently has a 16 percent share of the global market for advanced batteries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the US market share of advanced batteries is solely due to the actions and policies of the Obama administration, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the US market share of advanced batteries, such as technological advancements, global market trends, or the actions of other countries.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the US had a 2 percent share of batteries supplied in 2008, not the global market share for advanced batteries.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it makes a leap from the 2 percent market share in 2008 to the projected 40 percent market share by 2015 without providing a clear explanation of how this growth will be achieved.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
