{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that there are more people living in the country who were not born here than at any time in history, without considering the growth of the total population over time.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the foreign-born population was higher from 1860 through the 1920s, indicating that it is not the highest it has ever been.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to demonstrate that the foreign-born population is the highest it has ever been, as experts argue that measuring it as a percentage of the total population is a better reflection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the foreign-born population is solely due to President Obama's plan, without considering other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the foreign-born population, such as changes in immigration policies or global migration patterns."}
