{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that there are only about 10 people in the United States Senate with any real business experience, which may not accurately represent the actual number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that there are only about 10 people in the Senate with real business experience.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having real business experience is necessary or beneficial for being a senator, which may be a problematic assumption as there are various skills and backgrounds that can contribute to effective governance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the importance of diverse backgrounds and expertise in the Senate, rather than solely focusing on business experience.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it does not consider the complexities and nuances of the senators' backgrounds and occupations, as well as the potential overlap or multiple occupations listed by some senators.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of senators with business experience if the actual number is higher than the stated 10.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that there are 27 senators in the 113th Congress who identified their occupation as \"business,\" as per the data from the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Quarterly Roll Call Guide."}
