{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided in the expert's verdict to suggest that the family in the video is actually the family of Indian athlete Hima Das. The video has been circulated in news reports about another Indian athlete, Swapna Barman, winning a gold medal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the family in the video is Hima Das' family without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption. It is based on the Hindi-language caption and the text superimposed on the video, which may not be reliable indicators.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it has been circulated in news reports about the family of Swapna Barman celebrating her gold medal win at the 2018 Asian Games. This suggests that the family in the video could be Swapna Barman's family and not Hima Das' family.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video has been circulated in news reports about Swapna Barman's family, not Hima Das' family. This contradicts the assumption made in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the situation by oversimplifying it to the family of Hima Das watching her win a gold medal. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the video being associated with another athlete, Swapna Barman, and her victory in the heptathlon at the 2018 Asian Games.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
