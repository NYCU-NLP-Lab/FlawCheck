{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the progress made in tarmacking roads across the country. While it states that 3,000 kms have been completed and a further 5,000 kms are under construction, it does not provide any evidence or specific details to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of evidence or specific data to back up the statement that 3,000 kms of roads have been completed and 5,000 kms are under construction. Without this supporting information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tarmacking 10,000 kms of roads was a promise made when the President assumed office. However, there is no evidence or context provided to support this assumption. It is unclear if this was an actual promise made or if it is being used as a rhetorical device.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Without more information or context, there could be alternative explanations for the progress made in tarmacking roads. It is possible that the progress is not solely due to the efforts of the current President, but could also be attributed to previous administrations or other factors."}
