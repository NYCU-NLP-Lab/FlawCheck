{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Scott Brown voted with President Obama by stating that it was 70% of the time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Scott Brown voted with President Obama 70% of the time in 2011.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting with President Obama is a negative aspect, implying that it contradicts Brown's conservative beliefs. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the context or reasons behind Brown's votes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Brown's voting record, such as the possibility that his votes aligned with President Obama's position due to shared bipartisan interests or constituents' needs."}
