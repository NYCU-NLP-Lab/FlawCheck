{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the photo by implying that politicians in the Philippines only become \"crippled\" when they have a case against them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the doctored photo accurately portrays the reality of Enrile's situation and implies that he is falsely presenting himself as disabled.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Enrile is using his alleged disability for political gain.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo is doctored and not a genuine representation of Enrile's condition.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Enrile's use of a stock image, such as the lack of suitable photographs of him in a wheelchair."}
