{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that over 4.7 million free houses have been built benefiting over 14 million people. This could be an exaggeration if the actual number of houses and beneficiaries is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the numbers mentioned. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of free houses automatically benefits the stated number of people. It does not consider potential issues such as the quality of the houses, distribution, or other factors that could affect the actual benefits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the increase in the number of houses or beneficiaries. It presents the information as a direct result of the government's actions without considering other possible factors."}
