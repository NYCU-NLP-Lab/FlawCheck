{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs lost under President Obama's control by stating that \"every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost.\" The actual number is 1,517 net jobs lost per day during the period analyzed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost.\" It only provides the number of net jobs lost per day during a specific period.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all jobs lost during the specified period are solely attributable to President Obama's control of Washington, without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job losses, such as the impact of the global financial crisis that occurred during the same period."}
