{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the chairman of the party of Florida, who is an avid and outward supporter of Marco Rubio, has biased control over the appointment of 30 delegates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the chairman's support for Marco Rubio will result in biased delegate appointments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "It is possible that the chairman's support for Marco Rubio does not necessarily translate into biased delegate appointments, as there may be other factors and considerations involved in the selection process.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the delegate selection process in Florida, which involves various local GOP leaders and state committeemen and women, as well as a final vote by the state party's executive board.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the chairman, Blaise Ingoglia, has not officially endorsed any presidential candidate, including Marco Rubio.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by implying a direct connection between the chairman's past support for Rubio and his current role as state party chair, without considering the timing and context of their support for each other."}
