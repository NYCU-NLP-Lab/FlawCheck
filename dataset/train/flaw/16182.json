{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people who will lose their insurance under Obamacare, stating that up to 20 million people will be affected, while the expert's verdict reveals that the actual estimates range from 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer, with an additional decline of 1 million to 3 million Americans with individually purchased policies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that up to 20 million people will lose their insurance under Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report predicts up to 20 million people losing their insurance, while the expert's verdict reveals that the 20 million figure is one of several alternative scenarios presented by the CBO, with other estimates by different groups projecting much lower declines in coverage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual estimates from the CBO report range from 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer, which is significantly lower than the 20 million figure mentioned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or estimates provided by other groups, such as the Urban Institute and the Lewin Group, which projected lower declines in coverage compared to the claim's assertion of up to 20 million people losing their insurance."}
