{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the person being thrashed in the video is not the BJP candidate Ramkishore Saini but a late Congress worker, Vishwanath Saini.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the BJP candidate was actually thrashed by the public. The evidence provided is a video circulating on social media, which does not provide sufficient proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of the scuffle between Congress party workers and Vishwanath Saini from 2015 is recent and involves the BJP candidate Ramkishore Saini. This assumption is problematic as it is based on a misidentification of the individuals in the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, which is that the video is from a 2015 scuffle between Congress party workers and Vishwanath Saini, and not related to the current BJP candidate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that the BJP candidate was \"severely thrashed\" by the public. This is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not verifying the authenticity of the video and misidentifying the individuals involved."}
