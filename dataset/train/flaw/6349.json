{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of incentives that Scott Walker wants state taxpayers to provide to Foxconn. The expert's verdict mentions that Walker wants taxpayers to provide up to $250 million annually, but it questions whether this is a good deal considering that only $181 million in tax revenue is expected to be generated.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the figures mentioned. The expert's verdict also mentions that One Wisconsin Now pointed to reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, but it is unclear if these reports provide sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incentives provided to Foxconn will result in $181 million in tax revenue. The expert's verdict questions whether this assumption is valid and whether the state is offering too much in incentives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation mentioned in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any specific facts, but the expert's verdict raises questions about the amount of incentives being offered and the potential tax revenue generated.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at times, as it presents a straightforward statement about Scott Walker's proposal."}
