{"Exaggerate": "The claim that India's 2,000 Rupee notes contain nano chips is an exaggeration as there is no evidence or official confirmation to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the existence of nano chips in the currency notes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tearing the currency note will reveal the nano chip, which is a problematic assumption as there is no basis or evidence for this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation for the claim is that the image used in the misleading posts is a stock image that has been used in unrelated contexts, such as a 2014 BBC story about contraception. This suggests that the image is not related to nano chips in Indian currency notes."}
