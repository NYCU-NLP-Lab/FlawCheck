{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that California has passed a law allowing undocumented residents to vote. The expert's verdict clarifies that California has implemented a law for automatic voter registration of motorists, but it does not authorize non-citizens to vote in federal elections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law allowing undocumented residents to obtain driver's licenses will make it easier for non-citizens to unlawfully vote. However, the expert's verdict states that critics contend this, but there is no evidence provided to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that California has passed a law allowing undocumented residents to vote. The expert's verdict provides information about the law for automatic voter registration of motorists, but it does not mention any specific law allowing undocumented residents to vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by stating that the combination of the law allowing undocumented residents to obtain driver's licenses and the automatic voter registration law sparked fears that California was allowing undocumented residents to vote. However, it does not confirm or deny the validity of these fears."}
