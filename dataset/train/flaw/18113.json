{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by the taxi industry that it transports 70% of South Africa's commuters, or more than 15 million people daily, may be an exaggeration. The expert's verdict mentions that the most recent national household travel survey estimated that 26.5% of all workers used taxis as their main mode of transport, which is significantly lower than the claim made by the industry.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific data or evidence provided to back up the assertion that the taxi industry transports more than 15 million commuters daily. The expert's verdict mentions that the most recent data available estimates that approximately 3.7 million people use taxis as their main mode of transport to work.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all taxi commuters are considered \"commuters\" as defined by the national transport act, which refers to individuals who travel daily between home and work. However, there are different definitions and interpretations of the term \"commuter,\" as mentioned by the expert's verdict. This assumption may be problematic and may not accurately represent the entire population of taxi users.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the taxi industry's claim contradicts the data collected by the national household travel survey, which estimated that 26.5% of workers use taxis as their main mode of transport. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim made by the industry may not be accurate or representative of the actual number of taxi commuters.", "Contradict fact": "The claim made by the taxi industry that it transports 70% of South Africa's commuters contradicts the data collected by the national household travel survey, which estimated that 26.5% of workers use taxis as their main mode of transport. This contradiction suggests that the claim may not be factually accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by the taxi industry may falter at times due to the lack of specific data and evidence to support the assertion that it transports more than 15 million commuters daily. The expert's verdict highlights the discrepancies between the claim and the available data, suggesting that the claim may not be reliable or consistent.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim understates any information or facts."}
