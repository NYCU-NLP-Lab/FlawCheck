{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which almost all models predicted that Dorian would hit Alabama. The expert's verdict states that the tweet shared by Trump did not show most models hitting Alabama.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that almost all models predicted Dorian would hit Alabama.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that forecasters did not give Alabama a 95% chance of being hit, as stated by the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the originally projected path of the hurricane, as shown in the tweet shared by Trump, accurately represented the predictions of almost all models.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Trump insisted that Alabama was in the hurricane's path, such as misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the information he received."}
