{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the candidate did not take any \"corporate PAC money\" is exaggerated because the expert found evidence that the candidate did receive contributions from PACs, some of which were funded by corporations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because the expert provides evidence from the Federal Election Commission and statements from researchers to contradict it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that receiving money from labor PACs and Democratic leadership PACs means no corporate PAC money was involved, which the expert argues is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation that receiving money from PACs reliant on support from executives and employees of large corporations does involve corporate funds, even if not directly from corporate PACs."}
