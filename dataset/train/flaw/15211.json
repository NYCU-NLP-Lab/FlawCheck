{"Understate": "The claim underestimates or downplays Joe Biden's condemnation of antifa by stating that he had not condemned them as of September 29, 2020, when he actually did condemn them earlier.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge that Biden had already condemned antifa in previous statements and interviews, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the perception that he had not condemned them.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden did condemn antifa in an interview on September 7, 2020, as well as in other instances.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to prove that Biden had not condemned antifa, as it ignores his previous statements and interviews where he did condemn them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden had not condemned antifa solely based on the fact that he was not asked to do so during the first presidential debate, without considering his previous condemnations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Biden had not condemned antifa, as he had actually done so in multiple instances, contrary to the claim's assertion."}
