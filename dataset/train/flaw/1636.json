{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of President Trump's actions on prescription drug prices by stating that prices went down after he took office. The expert's verdict suggests that while there have been some declines and slower increases in drug prices, they have not necessarily gone down overall.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a single source, the Red Pill Fairy website, which is described as a right-wing resource. The expert's verdict points out that this source is a copy of a statement on the White House website, but it does not provide additional evidence or sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Consumer Price Index's Prescription Drug Index (CPI-Rx) used by President Trump's advisors is the best measure of prescription drug prices. However, the expert's verdict highlights that this measure may not accurately reflect the cost of prescription drugs to patients, as it only considers list prices at pharmacies and not the prices negotiated by insurers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while there have been some declines and slower increases in prescription drug prices, it is important to consider other factors that may contribute to these changes. For example, the verdict mentions that the measures used may exclude specialty drugs and may not provide a full picture of where prices are increasing.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of prescription drug pricing by presenting a simplified narrative that prices went up before President Trump and down after he took office. The expert's verdict emphasizes that while there have been some declines and slower increases, drug prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace."}
