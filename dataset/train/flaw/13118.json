{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential risks and dangers associated with commercial nuclear reactors by stating that there has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of deaths in the immediate crisis surrounding the Three Mile Island accident and in other commercial U.S. plants means that there have never been any deaths caused by reactor operation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lack of deaths, such as luck or chance, rather than solely relying on the safety of commercial nuclear reactors."}
