{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt communicated via secret hand signals during the first presidential debate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the hand gestures made by Clinton and Holt were part of a deliberate signaling plot, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Clinton has been in the public eye for decades and it is unlikely that she never once touched her face during speeches, campaign rallies, or debates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by stringing together unrelated events (Clinton scratching her face, Holt making a comment, Clinton replying to Trump) and asserting a connection without providing any proof.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the hand gestures by suggesting they were part of a rigged debate, without sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that both candidates, not just Clinton, made similar gestures during the first presidential debate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the hand gestures, such as natural or unintentional movements, and instead jumps to the conclusion of secret communication."}
