The expert's verdict states that it is unclear which of the suspects was responsible for killing the girl and provides details from local news reports about the crime.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crime was suppressed by the mainstream news media without providing any evidence to support this assertion. The expert's verdict contradicts this assumption by stating that the crime was reported by a local television station and providing details from court testimony.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the crime, such as the involvement of drug trafficking or other motives. The expert's verdict provides information about the involvement of the Sinaloa Cartel and the argument over a drug buy that led to the fatal incident."}
