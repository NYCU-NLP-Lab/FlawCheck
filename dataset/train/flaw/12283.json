{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Mary Burke's role in the Doyle administration on Wisconsin's job losses by stating that she \"left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs.\" This is an exaggeration of the actual numbers and does not accurately reflect the full context of the job situation during that time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Mary Burke was solely responsible for the job losses in Wisconsin. The ad cites a source from PolitiFact Wisconsin, but that source actually rated a similar claim by Scott Walker as \"Mostly False\" and stated that the national economic crash had a larger impact on job losses than state policies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mary Burke's tenure as Commerce secretary under Governor Doyle directly caused the job losses in Wisconsin. However, it fails to consider other factors such as the national economic downturn and other policies implemented during that time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the job losses in Wisconsin, such as the impact of the national economic crash or other factors beyond Mary Burke's control. It simplifies the complex issue of job losses to solely blame Burke and the Doyle administration."}
