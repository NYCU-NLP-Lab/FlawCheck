{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the pay raises given to politicians by using the phrase \"huge pay raises.\" The actual pay raise mentioned in the article is an $1,800 cost-of-living increase, which may not be considered \"huge\" in the context of overall salaries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific details to support the accusation that Gov. Pritzker gave pay raises to his politician buddies. The article mentions a news station article that claimed lawmakers gave themselves a pay raise, but it also highlights the opposition and legal challenges to that claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. Pritzker intentionally gave pay raises to his politician buddies while voters were distracted, without providing evidence or justification for this assumption. It may be a problematic assumption to make without further supporting information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions the history of how state lawmakers are compensated, with automatic cost-of-living increases being implemented through past acts. This alternative explanation suggests that the pay raises may not have been directly given by Gov. Pritzker but rather a result of the existing compensation system."}
