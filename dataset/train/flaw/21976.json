{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the impact of President Obama's overturning of the Mexico City Policy by stating that federal tax dollars can be used to fund abortion all over the world. The expert's verdict clarifies that a 1973 federal law, the Helms amendment, prohibits U.S. foreign aid from paying for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that federal tax dollars can be used to fund abortion all over the world. The expert's verdict provides information about the Mexico City Policy, its restrictions, and the Helms amendment, which contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the overturning of the Mexico City Policy by President Obama automatically allows federal tax dollars to fund abortions worldwide. However, the expert's verdict highlights the existence of the Helms amendment, which restricts the use of U.S. foreign aid for abortions as a method of family planning.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict, which states that the Helms amendment prohibits the use of federal tax dollars for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries, regardless of the Mexico City Policy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Helms amendment, a federal law, restricts the use of U.S. foreign aid for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries. The expert's verdict provides this information to counter the claim made.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
