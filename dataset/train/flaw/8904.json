{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating by stating that Fox News \"said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama.\" It is possible that Fox News covered the incident involving the New Black Panther Party extensively, but it is unlikely that they explicitly stated that the party decided the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or quotes from Fox News to back up the assertion that they made such a statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Fox News made the statement that the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Fox News' coverage of the incident involving the New Black Panther Party, such as highlighting potential voter intimidation or criticizing the Obama administration's handling of the case. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
