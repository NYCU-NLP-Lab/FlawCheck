{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or examples to support the assertion that under the Arizona immigration law, police are required to check immigration status if someone's \"lawn is overgrown\" or if a dog is \"barking too loudly.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Arizona immigration law includes provisions that require police to check immigration status based on trivial reasons like an overgrown lawn or a barking dog. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any information or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the new version of the law added the phrase \"in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state.\" This could suggest that there may be alternative explanations or justifications for police questioning individuals about their immigration status, such as the enforcement of other laws or ordinances. However, it does not directly address the claim's specific examples of an overgrown lawn or a barking dog."}
