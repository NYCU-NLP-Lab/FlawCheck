{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the alleged voter fraud by stating that the woman delivered 400 pre-marked ballots, when in fact she is accused of changing more than 400 absentee ballot applications.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the woman was arrested for delivering 400 pre-marked ballots. The provided information states that she was arrested for allegedly changing absentee ballot applications.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that the woman's actions constitute widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The expert's verdict mentions that the case resurfaced on social media in an attempt to provide evidence of voter fraud, but it does not confirm that the woman's actions had any impact on the election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may fail to consider alternative explanations for the woman's actions. The expert's verdict mentions that she is a Democratic Party activist and was accused of sending voters pre-selected absentee ballot applications, which suggests that her actions may have been motivated by partisan reasons rather than an attempt to commit voter fraud.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the alleged offense by describing it as simply delivering pre-marked ballots, when in fact the woman is accused of changing absentee ballot applications, which is a felony offense.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting information from social media posts without verifying their accuracy. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from Facebook posts and meme versions, which may not always provide reliable information."}
