{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that limiting labor negotiations to only wages is the norm in the private sector, which is a problematic assumption because private sector unions generally bargain on all sorts of things, not just wages.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that limiting labor negotiations to only wages is how it is for the most part in the private sector.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that private sector unions are covered by a federal law, the National Labor Relations Act, which allows for bargaining on various aspects such as wages, benefits, hours, and working conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that labor negotiations in the private sector go beyond just wages and encompass a wider range of topics.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a generalization about labor negotiations in the private sector without considering the diversity of practices and agreements that exist.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which labor negotiations in the private sector are limited to only wages, as it fails to acknowledge the broader scope of bargaining that occurs in many private sector unions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and diversity of labor negotiations in the private sector by simplifying it to just wages."}
