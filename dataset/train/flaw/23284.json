{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that election officials did not take a break, but rather worked all night and into the early morning to count the ballots in Wisconsin.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k after a break, when in reality, the shift in results was due to the processing of mail-in ballots.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate the assertion that Wisconsin took a break and Biden coincidentally came back ahead.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the delay in reporting results was due to a break taken by election officials, when in fact it was caused by an influx of mail-in ballots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the shift in results was a result of the processing of mail-in ballots, which tend to skew towards Democrats and were counted later in the process."}
