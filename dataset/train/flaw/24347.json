{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the series of photos show Iranian rockets being launched toward U.S. air bases in Iraq lacks enough support. The expert's analysis reveals that the photos are actually from old missile strikes by Iran and Israel, not the recent attack on the U.S. air bases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photos do not depict the missiles that hit the Al Asad and Erbil bases in Iraq on Jan. 7. The expert's analysis clearly states that the photos are from previous missile strikes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photos by implying that they show the recent Iranian rocket attacks on U.S. air bases in Iraq, when in fact they are unrelated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos are evidence of the Iranian rocket attacks on U.S. air bases in Iraq without verifying their authenticity or source.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the photos are from previous missile strikes and not related to the recent attack on the U.S. air bases."}
