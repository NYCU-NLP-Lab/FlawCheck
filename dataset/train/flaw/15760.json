{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the divorce rate by stating that \"67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce,\" while experts estimate the likelihood of marriages ending in divorce to be between 40 percent and 50 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the stated divorce rate of 67 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if same-sex couples are allowed to wed, they would face the same divorce rates as heterosexual couples, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the 67 percent figure is an \"odd number\" and questions its accuracy, indicating that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing divorce rates that are not accounted for in the claim."}
