{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the level of support for Gary Johnson by stating that he is polling at about 8 percent, while the available polls show support ranging from 6 to 7 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only mentions one specific poll that includes Johnson's name, and it is conducted by a Democratic firm using an automated calling method that has been considered inferior to live interviewers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation for Johnson's 8 percent support, which is attributed to the fact that he is listed as the third name in the polls rather than his personal appeal or policies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that polling at 15 percent is necessary to secure a spot on the national debate stage with Obama and Romney, without providing any evidence or explanation for this threshold.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gary Johnson never broke 1 percent in a Republican primary, suggesting that his 8 percent support in the general election polls may be questionable.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Johnson's support by stating that he is polling at about 8 percent, while the available polls show support ranging from 6 to 7 percent."}
