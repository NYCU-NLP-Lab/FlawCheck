{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which politicians want to put new taxes on groceries. The expert's verdict mentions that politicians in some cash-strapped states are considering food and drink taxes, but it does not provide evidence that this is a widespread or universal desire among politicians.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that \"some politicians want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries.\" It is a general statement without specific details or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of new taxes on groceries is to control what people eat and drink. This assumption is not supported by evidence or specific information about the motivations behind such taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why politicians might be considering food and drink taxes, such as funding healthcare or addressing budget deficits. It presents the idea that politicians want to tax groceries as a negative without exploring potential justifications or alternative perspectives."}
