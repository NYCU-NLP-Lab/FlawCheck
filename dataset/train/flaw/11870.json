{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children worldwide living in orphanages or residential institutions by stating that there are an estimated 8 million, while a more recent estimate from UNICEF suggests that the number is likely to be significantly lower at 2 million.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of children who are actual orphans by stating that 80% of children in orphanages are not orphans. This implies that only 20% of children in orphanages are true orphans, which may not accurately reflect the actual percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the data it relies on is outdated and unreliable. The 8 million figure originates from a 1985 report, and more recent data suggests a significantly lower number. Additionally, the claim is based on estimates from different organizations without comprehensive statistical studies to verify the figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having children with parents living in orphanages is troubling without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. It does not address potential benefits or drawbacks of such arrangements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why children with living parents may be placed in orphanages, such as poverty or social exclusion due to discrimination. It implies that these children are placed in orphanages despite having at least one living parent without exploring the underlying reasons."}
