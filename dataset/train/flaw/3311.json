{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who die of cancer each day. It is stated that 26,383 people die of cancer daily, but the expert's verdict mentions that there were 9.6 million deaths from cancer in 2018, which translates to around 26,000 deaths per day worldwide. This suggests that the claim may be overstating the daily death toll.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific sources or evidence to support the stated number of daily cancer deaths. However, the expert's verdict does mention the World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer, which provides an estimate of 26,000 cancer deaths per day worldwide. This suggests that there is some support for the claim, but it may still lack sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation mentioned in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any facts mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times."}
