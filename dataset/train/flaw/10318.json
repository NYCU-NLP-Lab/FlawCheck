{"Understates": "The claim states that the graduation rate reached an all-time high of 82.5 percent in 2012, but the expert's verdict mentions that the graduation rate for economically disadvantaged students in Austin is actually 78.9 percent, which is lower than the overall rate mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the statement about the graduation rate reaching an all-time high. It is not clear where the information comes from or how it was calculated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a high graduation rate is a measure of success without considering other factors that may impact the quality of education or student outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the graduation rate in Austin has been improving steadily over the years, but it does not explore other possible factors or explanations for this improvement, such as changes in educational policies or interventions.", "Contradicts fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that Austin still has the lowest graduation rate among the state's large urban districts for economically disadvantaged students, which contradicts the claim that the graduation rate reached an all-time high.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Austin's graduation rate has improved for some student groups, such as African-American and Hispanic students, but has only improved by a small margin for white students. This suggests that the claim may not fully capture the disparities in graduation rates among different student populations.", "Exaggerates": "The claim presents the graduation rate of 82.5 percent as a great rate by most standards, but it does not provide any context or comparison to support this statement. It is unclear what the standards or benchmarks are for considering a graduation rate as \"great.\""}
