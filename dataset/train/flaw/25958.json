{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the media \"never show crowds\" at Trump rallies. The expert's verdict provides evidence that this is not true and that the media has indeed shown Trump's crowds through photos and written articles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or examples to back up the assertion that the media never shows crowds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the media's failure to show crowds is intentional and biased against Trump. However, the expert's verdict explains that the media's focus on the candidate speaking behind the podium is a practical decision based on the limited resources and the goal of capturing clear audio.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for why the media may not always show crowds, which is the technical limitations and constraints of the head-on pool camera used by most media outlets.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the media has indeed shown Trump's crowds through photos and written articles, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
