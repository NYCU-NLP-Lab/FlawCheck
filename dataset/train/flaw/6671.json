{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Michelle Obama filed for divorce after discovering that former President Barack Obama had a pregnant mistress. The only source provided is a satirical website known for publishing false information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph of a British woman published in a UK tabloid in 2012 is somehow connected to Barack Obama and his alleged mistress. However, there is no evidence or logical basis for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph in question has no connection to Barack Obama or any alleged affair. The photograph was part of an article about post-pregnancy changes in women's bodies.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Michelle Obama immediately called for backup upon seeing the photograph. This adds dramatic flair to the story but lacks credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a satirical website as a source of information. The website openly admits that its articles should be considered satirical and may not contain any truth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photograph, which is that it has no connection to Barack Obama or any alleged affair. The photograph was published in a UK tabloid in 2012 and was unrelated to the Obamas."}
