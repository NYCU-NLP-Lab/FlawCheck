{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which bakers, florists, and photographers have been forced to participate in same-sex marriages, as the expert's investigation suggests that there may not be many cases of vendors being hauled off to jail or facing severe consequences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or examples to support the assertion that bakers, florists, and photographers are being forced to participate in same-sex marriages. The expert's investigation found no concrete evidence of vendors being sued or facing legal action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage will lead to vendors being forced to participate in same-sex marriages, without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why bakers, florists, and photographers might refuse to serve same-sex couples, such as personal beliefs or preferences, rather than being forced by law.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that same-sex marriage is not legal in every state, as only 12 states currently allow gay marriages. This contradicts the claim that vendors are being forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law in all cases.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the consequences faced by vendors who refuse to serve same-sex couples, as the expert's investigation found no evidence of vendors being hauled off to jail or facing severe penalties."}
