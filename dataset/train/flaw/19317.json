{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the allegation that Donald Trump stiffed the caterer at his wedding. There are no receipts, invoices, contracts, or names/quotes from anyone involved provided to substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the anecdotal story from a friend of a friend is true without providing any additional evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The absence of any mention of the alleged incident in major news publications or any public complaints or lawsuits suggests that there may be alternative explanations or that the incident did not occur as described.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential magnitude of the catering bill for a grand wedding like Donald Trump's, implying that the alleged non-payment would have been a significant financial loss for the caterer.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that major news publications covered Donald Trump's wedding, implying that any significant controversy or non-payment would likely have been reported.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the alleged non-payment on the caterer's career, suggesting that catering Trump's wedding would have been a major boost that could not be achieved in any other way.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and verifiable account of the alleged incident, relying on a 22-year-old anecdote without additional supporting evidence."}
