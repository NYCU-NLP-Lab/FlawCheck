However, the expert's verdict suggests that the image was created through digital editing, implying that the resemblance may be coincidental or not intended by the photographer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it is based on a genuine photograph of the Irtysh River but with the addition of the \"ghostface\" through digital editing. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the ice naturally resembles the mask from the movie Scream.", "Contradict fact": "The claim presents the photograph as depicting the frozen Irtysh River in Russia, but the expert's verdict reveals that the image is digitally altered and not a true representation of the river.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the resemblance between the ice and the mask from the movie Scream by presenting it as a significant and intentional similarity.
