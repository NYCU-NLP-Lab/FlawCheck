McSally has tried to limit women's access to birth control.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. McSally's support for a bill to make contraception more expensive is inherently negative for women's access to birth control, without considering potential alternative perspectives or intentions behind the bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rep. McSally's support for the bill, such as the argument that making contraception available over-the-counter could provide a new pathway for affordable access for people without health insurance."}
