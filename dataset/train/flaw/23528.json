{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States\" is considered exaggerated by the expert. They state that the number seems to be fabricated and there is no evidence to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that there is no accurate data or evidence available to support the claim of abandoned wind turbines.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there are a significant number of abandoned wind turbines in the United States, which the expert disputes.", "Falters at times": "The wind energy association has struggled to correct the misconception and debunk the claim, indicating that the claim may falter in terms of credibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the origin of the 14,000 figure used in the claim may be based on a misinterpretation of the total number of wind turbines in California at one time, rather than the number of abandoned turbines."}
