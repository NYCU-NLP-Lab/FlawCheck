{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Rubio's alignment with the Koch brothers by stating that he has a \"98 percent voting record\" with them. It is not clear if this percentage accurately represents Rubio's voting record in alignment with the Koch brothers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the accuracy of the 98 percent voting record. It is based on a scorecard from Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed political group, but the specific details or methodology behind this scorecard are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that aligning with the Koch brothers, who are described as a \"right-wing special interest group,\" is inherently negative. This assumption may be seen as problematic as it implies that any alignment with the Koch brothers is automatically unfavorable.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rubio's alignment with the Koch brothers. It does not explore other potential reasons for their support, such as shared policy goals or ideological alignment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not explicitly contradict any known facts, but the lack of sufficient evidence or support makes it difficult to determine its accuracy."}
