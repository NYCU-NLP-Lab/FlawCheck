{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Americans believe the election was rigged. The percentages provided (39% of Americans, 31% of independents, and 17% of Democrats) may be higher than the actual numbers.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the percentage of people who believe the election outcome was the result of illegal voting or election rigging, as another question in the survey yielded lower numbers than those cited by Cruz.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a specific poll and does not provide information on the methodology, sample size, or margin of error of the poll.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the belief that the election was rigged is a reality for nearly half the country, without considering other factors that may influence this belief or alternative explanations for the poll results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the poll results, such as political polarization or media influence, which may contribute to differing perceptions of the election being rigged."}
