{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support for background checks among certain groups, such as gun owners and NRA households. The numbers provided (82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households) may be higher than the actual level of support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the percentages mentioned. The expert's verdict mentions that no recent independent polls have been conducted specifically among New Hampshire NRA members.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for background checks among Democrats, Republicans, gun owners, and NRA households in New Hampshire is representative of the entire population. However, the claim does not provide information on the sample size or demographic representation of the respondents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the drop in poll numbers for Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte after voting against the Senate proposal. It assumes that the drop was solely due to her position on background checks, without considering other factors that may have influenced public opinion."}
