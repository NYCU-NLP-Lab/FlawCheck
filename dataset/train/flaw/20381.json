{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which charter schools in Missouri are failing, as the data shows that they are performing about the same as nearby public schools.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that charter schools in Missouri are failing in a greater capacity than public school systems.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of a specific definition for \"failing\" in the Missouri education department means that charter schools are failing in a greater capacity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the perceived failure of charter schools, such as the specific circumstances or challenges faced by individual schools.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which shows that only 33% of charter school districts have closed since 1999.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear definition of what constitutes \"failing\" for charter schools in Missouri."}
