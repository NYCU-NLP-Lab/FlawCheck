{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the \"No Glory for Hate Act\" by stating that it would specifically prevent former President Donald Trump from being buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The expert's verdict clarifies that the bill does not mention Trump by name, but rather applies to any former president who has been twice impeached.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the assertion that the \"No Glory for Hate Act\" would prevent Trump from being buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The expert's verdict explains that while the bill does not mention Trump explicitly, it presently only applies to him as the first and only president who fits the description of being twice impeached.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the \"No Glory for Hate Act\" specifically targets Trump and aims to prevent his burial at Arlington National Cemetery. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the bill does not mention Trump by name and applies to any former president who has been twice impeached.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose and scope of the \"No Glory for Hate Act.\" The expert's verdict provides additional context, such as the bill's proposal before Trump's second impeachment and its aim to impose restrictions on certain former presidents, but it does not explore alternative explanations in detail."}
