{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by using the term \"defunded\" to describe Whitmer's proposed funding cuts for the Michigan State Police and Department of Corrections. The expert's verdict clarifies that the funding cuts are not a complete defunding but rather a reduction in funding.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Whitmer's proposed funding cuts by not providing the full context of her plan. The expert's verdict explains that most of the funding gap will be filled by federal Coronavirus Relief Fund money, leaving only small budget shortfalls for the State Police and Department of Corrections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Whitmer \"defunded\" the Michigan State Police and prisons. The expert's verdict provides detailed information about Whitmer's proposal and the funding arrangement, which contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by equating Whitmer's funding cuts with defunding the police and prisons. The expert's verdict highlights that this assumption is politically charged and not an accurate description of Whitmer's proposal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Whitmer's funding cuts, such as the budget shortfall caused by the COVID-19 crisis and recession. The expert's verdict explains the context of the budget gap and the need for federal relief.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Whitmer's proposal does not completely defund the Michigan State Police and prisons. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the funding amounts and the use of federal dollars to fill most of the gap.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not indicate any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim itself."}
