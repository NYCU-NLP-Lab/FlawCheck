{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential increase in the national debt caused by Donald Trump's policies. The actual estimate is $11.2 trillion over 10 years, but the claim states $30 trillion without specifying a time frame.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the statement that independent analysts say Donald Trump would add $30 trillion to the national debt. The source mentioned is the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, but the claim does not provide any specific analysis or data from this organization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's tax plan would solely benefit the wealthiest Americans, Wall Street money managers, and large corporations without considering any potential positive impacts or benefits for other groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential increase in the national debt, such as potential spending cuts or other economic factors that could offset the impact of Trump's policies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using a larger and unconventional 20-year time frame to present the estimate of $30 trillion, rather than the more commonly used 10-year window. This choice of time frame can be misleading and distort the actual impact of Trump's policies on the national debt.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual estimate from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center is $11.2 trillion over 10 years, not $30 trillion.", "Understate": "None apparent."}
