{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Kasich's efforts in keeping and creating jobs in Ohio. The expert mentions that the claim is easily proven by two specific deals, but it is unclear if these deals alone are representative of Kasich's overall job creation efforts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully validate the extent of Kasich's job creation efforts. The expert mentions that economists have stated it is too soon to determine if Kasich's policies have had a significant impact on employment in Ohio.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that critics believe the companies mentioned in the claim, such as American Greetings and Diebold, were not actually planning to leave Ohio and used the threats as leverage for better deals. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Kasich's actions were solely responsible for keeping these jobs in Ohio.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that Kasich's previous claim about being solely responsible for the net 45,000 new jobs in the state was rated as Mostly False. This suggests that Kasich's claims about job creation may not always be accurate or fully supported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions taken by Kasich, such as going to the doorsteps of companies, directly resulted in keeping jobs in Ohio. However, it is possible that other factors or negotiations played a significant role in these outcomes."}
