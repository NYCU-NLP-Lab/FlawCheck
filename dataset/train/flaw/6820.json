{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Bernie Sanders marched with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in Cuba. The photo provided as evidence does not conclusively prove Sanders' presence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the man in the photo marching with Castro and Guevara is Bernie Sanders, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Sanders' campaign spokesman explicitly denied that Sanders ever met with Castro or Guevara.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sanders did not travel by airplane until 1961, which makes it highly unlikely that he could have been present in Cuba for the alleged march.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the identity of the man in the photo, stating that it is Regino Boti Le\u00f3n, not Bernie Sanders."}
