{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of deaths that will occur each day until the Legislature ratifies the pain clinic rules. While the expert's verdict confirms that people are dying from prescription drug abuse, it does not provide evidence to support the claim that seven people will die each day until the rules are ratified.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that seven people will die each day until the rules are ratified.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ratification of the pain clinic rules is the sole solution to reduce the number of deaths from prescription drug abuse. It does not consider other potential factors or interventions that could address the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in prescription drug abuse deaths, such as changes in prescribing practices, availability of drugs, or other societal factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it does not provide a clear causal link between the ratification of the pain clinic rules and the reduction in deaths. It implies a direct cause and effect relationship without sufficient evidence.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or make any statements that downplay the severity of the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts or information provided in the expert's verdict."}
