{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the funding increase for persons with disabilities by only mentioning the $36 million increase without providing context on the number of people it will actually help (only about 750 out of 22,000 on the waiting list).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully evaluate the impact of the funding increase, such as data on the current funding levels or the effectiveness of community-based services.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not addressing the fact that the waiting list for Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Medicaid waiver is still significant, and Florida's waiting list was the sixth-longest in the country in 2010.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding increase is a significant improvement for persons with disabilities, without considering the overall funding levels or the needs of the population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the funding increase, such as political motivations or pressure from advocacy groups, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that this is not the first time in eight years that funding for persons with disabilities has increased, as the claim suggests. The expert's research shows that Governor Scott's budget proposals in previous years also included funding for disability services.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the funding increase by presenting it as a significant improvement for disabled people, while the additional funding will only help a small fraction of those on the waiting list."}
