{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the State Department's involvement in directing contracts to friends of the Clintons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the emails obtained by ABC News do not provide evidence that the State Department helped the Clintons' friends or foundation donors obtain recovery contracts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the State Department directed contracts to friends of the Clintons based on the ABC News report, but the report actually shows close cooperation between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in identifying and assisting friends of Bill Clinton.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the State Department worked with the Clinton Foundation to identify and assist individuals offering help or seeking assistance in the Haitian recovery effort, rather than directly directing contracts to friends of the Clintons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that ABC News did not report that the State Department directed contracts to friends of the Clintons."}
