{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a single study conducted in a limited geographic area (cities in California) and does not include comparable data from other cities where Uber operates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in drunk driving deaths is solely due to the presence of Uber, without considering other factors that may contribute to the decrease.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the reduction in drunk driving deaths, such as increased awareness and enforcement of drunk driving laws, public campaigns against drunk driving, or the implementation of other transportation alternatives.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its generalizability and applicability to all cities where Uber operates, as the study only focuses on a specific time period and a limited geographic area.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of Uber on reducing drunk driving deaths by only providing a range of 3.6%-5.6% fewer deaths, without considering the potential for larger reductions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the study it is based on only includes data from cities in California, while Uber operates in many other cities across the United States.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Uber on reducing drunk driving deaths by not considering other studies that have found the effect to be insignificant or by not considering other factors that may contribute to the decrease in deaths."}
