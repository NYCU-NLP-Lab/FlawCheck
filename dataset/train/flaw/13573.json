{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that \"just last year, over 5,000 refugees came to New York state, and 94 percent settled outside of New York City.\" It is unclear where this information came from and whether it is accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding for refugee resettlement agencies in New York is directly linked to the number of refugees settled in the state. However, this may not necessarily be the case, as funding could be allocated based on other factors or criteria.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the settlement patterns of refugees in New York state. It does not explore factors such as availability of resources, job opportunities, or existing refugee communities that may influence where refugees choose to settle.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the number of refugees settled in New York City. While it states that 94 percent settled outside of New York City, it does not provide the actual number of refugees settled in the city, which could still be a substantial figure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that New York City accepted 5.6 percent of the refugees, which is not consistent with the statement that 94 percent settled outside of the city.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear and accurate information about the number of refugees settled in New York state and the distribution between different regions."}
