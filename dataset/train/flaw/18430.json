{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of jobs that will still be relocated to Mexico, as it only mentions \"hundreds\" of jobs, while the expert's verdict states that approximately 600 factory workers will be affected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"Carrier Corporation says it will still relocate hundreds of jobs to Mexico.\" It does not provide any direct quotes or evidence from Carrier Corporation confirming this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the agreement with President-elect Donald Trump was meant to keep all manufacturing jobs in the U.S., which may not have been the case. The expert's verdict mentions that the agreement aimed to keep \"most\" of the jobs in the U.S., not all.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative reasons or factors contributing to the relocation of jobs to Mexico, such as cost savings or business decisions beyond the agreement with President-elect Donald Trump."}
