{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs that would be created if President Obama approved the Keystone XL pipeline. The expert's verdict states that the pipeline would only create 35 permanent, full-time jobs and 15 temporary contractors, which is significantly lower than the claim suggests.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual number of jobs that would be created by the pipeline. The expert's verdict mentions that over the course of up to two years of construction, a total of 42,100 jobs would be supported by the construction of the proposed project.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"tens of thousands of jobs\" would be created. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the State Department that estimates a much lower number of jobs, both permanent and temporary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline by President Obama would directly result in the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the pipeline would only create a small number of permanent jobs, and the majority of the jobs would be temporary and indirectly supported by the construction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the job-creation argument for the Keystone XL pipeline has been reviewed by fact-checkers multiple times, and it is concluded that the pipeline is not the massive job generator that some make it out to be."}
