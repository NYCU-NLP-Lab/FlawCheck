{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the American TV anchor, stating that he called Imran Khan a \"welder from Bronx\" when in reality, he referred to him as sounding like a \"voter from the Bronx.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a tweet from Virender Sehwag and an article from Republic TV as evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the anchor's statement was meant to humiliate Imran Khan, without considering alternative intentions or interpretations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the anchor's statement, which is that he was commenting on Imran Khan's critique of the infrastructure in New York while praising China's infrastructure."}
