{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they couldn't find definitive figures to support the claim of 1 million legal border crossings every day. This suggests a lack of sufficient evidence to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statement made by Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is accurate without providing concrete evidence. This assumption is problematic as it lacks proper verification.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the number of legal border crossings, as it presents a high estimate of 1 million per day. However, it is important to note that this bias is not explicitly present in the claim itself but rather in the expert's verdict, which suggests that the estimate sounds reasonable based on available data.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not appear to falter at times as it presents a specific number of legal border crossings. However, the lack of definitive figures and the expert's statement about the estimate being reasonable suggest some uncertainty.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the number of legal border crossings. However, the lack of definitive figures and the expert's statement about the estimate being reasonable suggest that there may be alternative explanations for the number."}
