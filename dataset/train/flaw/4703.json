{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effects of having a glass of wine at dinner by stating that it could make a person drunk. The expert's verdict provides evidence that a limited group of drinkers, specifically women weighing less than 120 pounds, could potentially reach a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.05 after one drink. However, it does not support the claim that this would make them \"drunk\" in the traditional sense.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that a 0.05 standard for drunken driving means having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. The expert's verdict provides some evidence that a 100-pound woman could reach a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.05 after one drink, but it does not address the level of impairment or whether it would classify as being \"drunk.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a 0.05 standard for drunken driving would mean that having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support or challenge this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations to the claim. It mainly focuses on providing evidence and information related to the recommendation of reducing the blood-alcohol concentration threshold for evidence of drunken driving."}
