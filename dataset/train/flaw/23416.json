{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden supports a complete ban on fracking. His official platform only calls for a ban on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of jobs at stake in Wisconsin by stating that it would cost 100,000 jobs, which is an overstatement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Joe Biden backs a fracking ban that would cost jobs in Wisconsin. The provided evidence suggests otherwise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a direct threat to Wisconsin's energy workers due to their proposal to eliminate fracking, but this assumption is problematic and not supported by evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Biden's statements on fracking, such as his response to Bernie Sanders during a debate, which may not reflect his official position."}
