{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the women protesters are collecting cash from the Congress party. The video does not clearly show the exchange of money, and there is no direct evidence linking the women to the Congress party.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Congress flags and the speech of Rahul Gandhi playing in the background indicate that the women protesters are being paid by Congress workers. However, this is a problematic assumption as it does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of these elements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of Congress flags and the speech of Rahul Gandhi in the video. It is possible that the women protesters are supporters of the Congress party, but it does not necessarily mean they are being paid by Congress workers."}
