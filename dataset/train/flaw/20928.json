{"Contradict fact": "The claim that \"Nigeria is COVID-19 free\" contradicts the data from the World Health Organization and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, which show that new cases have been reported every week in Nigeria since February 27.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Nigeria is completely free of the novel coronavirus, when in fact there have been confirmed cases and ongoing transmission in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Nigeria is COVID-19 free. The data from reputable sources contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nigeria is coronavirus-free based on limited information or isolated cases, without considering the broader context and ongoing transmission in the country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the limited number of reported cases in Nigeria at the time of the article. It does not explore factors such as limited testing capacity or underreporting that could contribute to the low number of confirmed cases."}
