{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of a carbon monoxide spike on the west coast as an indication of a massive earthquake. The expert's verdict explains that the spike in carbon monoxide levels was based on incorrect data and was a consequence of unrealistic emissions derived from satellite observations of fires.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is primarily based on conspiracy theory-type websites and unreliable data. The expert's verdict mentions that the data from earth.nullschool.net, which showed the unusual carbon monoxide levels, is experimental and not always correct.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a carbon monoxide spike is directly linked to the occurrence of a massive earthquake. However, the expert's verdict explains that the spike in carbon monoxide levels was a result of unrealistic emissions from satellite observations of fires, indicating a different cause for the spike.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the carbon monoxide spike, stating that it was a consequence of unrealistic emissions derived from satellite observations of fires. This suggests that the spike in carbon monoxide levels does not necessarily indicate an impending earthquake.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the carbon monoxide spike on the west coast was not a reliable indicator of a massive earthquake. The expert's verdict explains that the spike was based on incorrect data and unrealistic emissions from satellite observations of fires.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim and expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication that the claim falters at times in the provided information."}
