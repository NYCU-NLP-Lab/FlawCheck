{"Understate": "The claim understates the change in opinion on same-sex marriage in Alabama since 2006. The expert's verdict provides evidence that support for gay marriage has increased significantly nationwide in the last decade, but the claim suggests that Alabamians' opinion has remained unchanged.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up its assertion that Alabamians \"haven't changed their opinion\" on same-sex marriage since 2006. The expert's verdict provides evidence of a decrease in opposition to gay marriage in Alabama, but it does not provide enough data to conclusively support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 81 percent who voted for the constitutional amendment in 2006 still hold the same opinion on same-sex marriage. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this may not be an accurate assumption, as support for gay marriage has increased nationwide and there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in opposition in Alabama.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in opposition to same-sex marriage in Alabama. The expert's verdict suggests that the decline in opposition could be attributed to factors such as changing demographics and a shift in public opinion at the national level.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that support for same-sex marriage has increased nationwide in the last decade. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the Pew Research Center that shows a significant shift in public opinion on marriage rights for same-sex couples.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Alabamians' opinion on same-sex marriage has remained unchanged since 2006. The expert's verdict provides evidence that there has been a decrease in opposition to gay marriage in Alabama, indicating a change in opinion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the data on same-sex marriage in Alabama. The expert's verdict highlights the limitations of comparing a constitutional referendum in 2006 to a survey in 2012, and suggests that the claim's conclusion may not be supported by the available evidence."}
