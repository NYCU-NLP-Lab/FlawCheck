{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood's description of riots as \"beautiful protests\" by using a digitally-altered echo and footage of burning cars and ransacked buildings to create a misleading image.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Underwood's praise of \"beautiful protests\" extends to looting and rioting, without considering the full context of her remarks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Underwood supports acts of violence and property destruction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Underwood's statement, such as emphasizing the peaceful nature of protests while acknowledging instances of violence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the majority of demonstrations against racial injustice have been peaceful, as reported by the U.S. Crisis Monitor.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by oversimplifying Underwood's stance on rioting and looting."}
