{"Contradict fact": "The claim that President Trump has \"yet once to condemn white supremacy, the neo-Nazis\" contradicts the fact that he has actually condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis on multiple occasions.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that President Trump has condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis, as well as his repeated condemnations since the Charlottesville rally.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or examples to back up the assertion that President Trump has not condemned white supremacy or neo-Nazis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's condemnation of white supremacy and neo-Nazis should have been done in a specific manner or frequency, without considering the actual statements and actions he has taken.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that President Trump's comments about \"very fine people on both sides\" were referring to those who were protesting the removal of Confederate monuments, rather than white supremacists or neo-Nazis."}
