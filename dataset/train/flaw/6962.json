{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that firearms are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than for self-defense. The expert's verdict mentions that the study cited does not state this specific statistic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistics on suicide, assault, and self-defense can be added together to arrive at the conclusion of firearms being 17 times more likely to be used for negative purposes. However, the expert's verdict points out that these numbers cannot be added together as they are already accounted for under different categories.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the studies cited compare the risk of gun ownership to non-ownership, rather than directly comparing the use of guns for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors involved in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the importance or effectiveness of firearms in fending off intruders by not providing a comparison or context for the frequency of successful self-defense scenarios.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that firearms are more likely to be used for suicide or assault rather than for self-defense, as it suggests the opposite.", "Exaggerate": "Although not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, the claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact or likelihood of firearms being used for negative purposes, given the lack of specific evidence provided."}
