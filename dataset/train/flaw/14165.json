{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a spoof article from Inked magazine, which is not a reliable source of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Disney is banning customers with tattoos from all their theme parks, which is not supported by credible evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Disney resorts do have some restrictions on tattoos, but it is not a complete ban. The Dress Code at Disneyland prohibits visible tattoos that could be considered inappropriate.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Disney is banning all customers with tattoos, when in reality there are restrictions on visible tattoos that are considered inappropriate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting the spoof article as a legitimate source of information, without acknowledging its lack of credibility.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Disney has restrictions on tattoos to maintain a certain image and appeal to a family-friendly audience, rather than a complete ban on customers with tattoos."}
