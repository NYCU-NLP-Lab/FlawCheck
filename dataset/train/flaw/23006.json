{"Understate": "The claim may understate the minimum sick pay standards in the EU by stating that the EU does not set a minimum sick pay, while the expert's verdict mentions that the EU does not set a minimum sick leave or sick pay legislation for its member states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the UK sick pay is 28 weeks. The expert's verdict mentions that the rules are slightly different for some agricultural workers, indicating that there may be variations in sick pay duration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the UK sick pay duration is fixed at 28 weeks without considering any potential variations or exceptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the EU does not set a minimum sick pay, but it does not rule out the possibility of individual member states having their own sick pay regulations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the EU does enforce a minimum of four weeks' paid holiday leave, which was introduced in 1993 and implemented in UK law in 1998."}
