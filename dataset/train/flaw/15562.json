{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people who have converted to Islam in New Zealand after the Christchurch massacre. The actual number is not supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 350 people have converted to Islam in New Zealand after the Christchurch massacre.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Christchurch massacre would lead to a significant increase in conversions to Islam, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in conversions, such as unrelated personal reasons or coincidences, which are not explored or considered in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information, as it relies on social media posts, blogs, and videos that may not be trustworthy sources.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and nuances of people's motivations for converting to Islam, reducing it to a simplistic cause-and-effect relationship with the Christchurch massacre.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 49 people, not 51, were killed in the Christchurch massacre, suggesting a lack of accuracy or attention to detail."}
