{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by implying that it shows Jokowi handing out food before an election, when in fact it is an old video unrelated to the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove its assertion that Jokowi handing out food is problematic or misleading.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jokowi handing out food is not a legitimate action for a president, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that Jokowi's actions may have been part of a legitimate charitable or community outreach effort, rather than a political ploy."}
