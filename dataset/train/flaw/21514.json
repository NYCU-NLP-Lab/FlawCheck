{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that Putin has threatened jail time for people who don't stay at home during the coronavirus pandemic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Putin has implemented a policy to jail those who don't stay at home, without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no evidence of Putin threatening jail time for non-compliance with stay-at-home measures.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration of the situation in Russia, as there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin has given Russians the choice between staying at home or going to jail.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on a tweet by an Indian comedian that was later labeled as a joke, indicating that the claim may not be entirely reliable or accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations, such as misinformation or misunderstanding, rather than an actual policy implemented by Putin."}
