{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that 1 in 4 Wisconsin schools are \"failing\" the children they serve based on subpar scores on the Department of Public Instruction's report cards. The actual percentage of schools that received a failing score is not provided in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that these schools are \"failing\" the children they serve. It relies solely on the subpar scores on the report cards without further explanation or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that subpar scores on the report cards automatically equate to schools \"failing\" the children they serve. However, the report cards use a rating scale that includes different levels of performance, and it is not explicitly stated what criteria are used to determine if a school is failing or not.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the subpar scores, such as external factors that may influence school performance, socioeconomic disparities, or other challenges that schools may face. It presents a simplistic view that the subpar scores directly indicate failure without considering other factors."}
