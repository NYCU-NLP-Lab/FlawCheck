{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Merriam-Webster changed their dictionary definition to censor links between its new corporate owner and fascists. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is based on a theory and that McKay's account is riddled with errors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting incorrect information about the definition of fascism commonly attributed to Mussolini and the precise definition of corporatism in Mussolini's fascism.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Merriam-Webster changed their dictionary definition specifically to censor links between its new corporate owner and fascists. The expert's verdict points out the errors in the claim and the lack of clear evidence for McKay's theory.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Merriam-Webster changed their definition solely due to the influence of its new corporate owner, without considering other factors or motivations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the change in Merriam-Webster's definition of fascism, such as evolving language usage or editorial decisions unrelated to corporate influence."}
