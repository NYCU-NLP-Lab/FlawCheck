{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the Supreme Court ruling on the number of Americans who could lose subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The expert's verdict mentions that about 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states could be at risk of losing subsidies, which is a significant number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that \"Ninety-seven percent of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\" The expert's verdict provides information about the potential number of people who could lose subsidies, but it doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of the total number of Americans receiving subsidies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the majority of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the statement may not be accurate, as it mentions estimates of all insurance subsidies totaling about nine million. This indicates that a significant number of Americans do receive subsidies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation to the claim by mentioning that the intent of the ACA is to allow individuals to obtain subsidized insurance regardless of whether they obtain it through a state or federal exchange. This suggests that the claim's assumption may not be valid.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Georgia Congressman Austin Scott, stating that \"Ninety-seven percent of Americans aren't receiving those subsidies,\" may contradict the fact that estimates of all insurance subsidies, state and federal combined, total about nine million. This indicates that a significant portion of Americans do receive subsidies.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of Americans who do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. The expert's verdict provides evidence that millions of Americans could be at risk of losing subsidies, suggesting that the claim's statement of 97% may be an exaggeration."}
