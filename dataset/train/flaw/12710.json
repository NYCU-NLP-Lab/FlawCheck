{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that the World Bank's claim that 80% of poor households in Nigeria are found in northern states is unproven. This suggests that there is a lack of sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim should only have been in reference to public schools, according to a communications officer at the World Bank. This suggests that the claim may have made an assumption about the type of schools being referred to, which could be problematic.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that recent data shows that the ratio of one secondary school serving up to 10 primary schools in Nigeria is half of the World Bank's estimate. This indicates that the claim contradicts the fact that the ratio has changed over time.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the project document from the World Bank has a slight error in its statement about the lack of secondary schools. This suggests that the claim may have some inconsistencies or inaccuracies.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the lack of secondary schools in northern Nigeria is significantly greater, with up to 10 primary schools for every secondary school. This suggests that the claim may have understated the extent of the problem in the north.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are alternative sources of data on public and private basic education in Nigeria that could provide more accurate information. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or sources that could challenge the claim."}
