{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of temples being demolished by stating that 50 temples were ordered to be demolished, while the news report mentioned in the claim only talks about the demolition of illegal constructions, including temples.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a mischievously clipped video from a 10-year-old news report, which does not provide current evidence for the demolition of temples.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the demolition of temples is solely motivated by giving the land to Ambani's, without providing any evidence or supporting information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the demolition drive, such as targeting all illegal constructions and not just religious ones, as mentioned in the report.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from a 10-year-old news report and is being shared on social media to portray it as a recent decision of the central government.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing accurate information about the context and important details of the demolition drive, which would suggest that it was during the time when Narendra Modi was Chief Minister of Gujarat."}
