{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photograph shows former President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani contradicts the fact that they never met face-to-face during Obama's term of office.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph by implying that it represents a positive relationship between Obama and Rouhani, when in reality, the image was a fake created by altering a different photograph.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a fabricated image and does not provide any credible evidence to verify the authenticity of the photograph.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is genuine and accurately represents a meeting between Obama and Rouhani, which is a problematic assumption given the evidence that it is a fake image.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the photograph, which is that it was created by altering a 2011 photograph of Obama's meeting with former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's assertion that the photograph shows Obama and Rouhani shaking hands."}
