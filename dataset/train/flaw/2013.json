It does not provide specific statistics or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people killed with baseball bats and hammers is higher than the number killed with guns. This assumption may be problematic without concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the comparison made in the claim.
