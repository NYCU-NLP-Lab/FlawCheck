{"Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in Texas' unemployment rate compared to the nation's as a whole. The expert suggests that a more accurate statement would be \"the unemployment rate has increased at a faster rate in Texas.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in Texas' unemployment rate is a negative reflection on Governor Rick Perry's handling of the economy. This assumption may be problematic as there could be other factors contributing to the increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Texas' unemployment rate has grown more than the nation's as a whole. The expert's verdict mentions statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but it does not provide a detailed analysis or comparison of the data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in Texas' unemployment rate. It solely attributes it to Governor Perry's policies and failure to acknowledge the impact of federal stimulus money.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Texas has gained more jobs than all other states combined from January 2001 to June 2010, as mentioned in Governor Perry's TV spot. The claim focuses solely on the increase in unemployment rate without acknowledging the overall job gains in Texas.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using language that may be misleading or exaggerating the difference in unemployment rate growth between Texas and the nation as a whole. The expert suggests that the statement could have been phrased more accurately."}
