{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks any credible evidence or sources to support the assertion that there is an effort underway to lower the minimum age of consent for sexual activity to age 4.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a widespread and serious effort to change the age of consent to include toddlers, without providing any specific information or evidence to back this assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by presenting an extreme and alarming scenario without any substantial evidence or supporting facts.", "Understate": "There is no evidence presented to understate or downplay the seriousness of child sex trafficking, which is the original purpose of the \"SaveOurChildren\" hashtag.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that age of consent laws in the United States are determined on a state-by-state basis and generally range from 16 to 18 years old. There is no evidence of any serious or widespread effort to modify these laws to include 4-year-olds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the use of the \"SaveOurChildren\" hashtag, such as its association with the QAnon conspiracy theory rather than a genuine effort to combat child sex trafficking."}
