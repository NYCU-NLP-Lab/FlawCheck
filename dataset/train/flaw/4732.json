{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential impact of receiving two mail-in ballots by suggesting that both could be used in an upcoming election to vote twice.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the duplicate ballots would have identical scanning codes, making it impossible for both to be counted. Only one vote per scanning code is accepted, and any subsequent votes with the same code are rejected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the two ballots depicted in the image were indeed official mail-in ballots, or that they were intended for the same person.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the occurrence of a mailing error resulting in the receipt of two ballots by one resident is evidence of the vote-by-mail system's susceptibility to fraud, without providing any proof or supporting data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the mailing error, such as the computer glitch mentioned by the expert, which caused the printing of duplicate labels for mail-in and absentee ballots in Allegheny County."}
