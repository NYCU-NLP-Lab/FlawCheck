{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the presence of fecal microbes in men's beards by using sensationalized language and comparing them to toilets.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or a proper scientific study to support the assertion that men's beards are \"alarmingly riddled with fecal microbes.\"", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and accurate source for the study, as it is based on a local news report and not a rigorous scientific study.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of fecal matter in a few beards is representative of all men's beards, without considering factors such as hygiene practices or sample size.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of microbes in beards, such as normal skin flora or environmental factors."}
