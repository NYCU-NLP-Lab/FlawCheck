{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of job losses in the \"Great Recession\" by stating that more jobs were lost than in the last four recessions combined.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that more jobs were lost in the \"Great Recession\" compared to the last four recessions combined.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing the total number of jobs lost in different recessions is an accurate measure of the severity or impact of those recessions. However, this assumption may be problematic as the size of the labor force and other factors can vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job losses, such as changes in the labor market or economic factors beyond the recession itself."}
