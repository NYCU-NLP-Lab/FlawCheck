{"Understate": "The claim may understate the effectiveness of blocking \"Community Standards\" on Facebook as a way to avoid violating platform rules. The expert's verdict mentions that users claim this method can be used to avoid problems with Facebook going against community standards, but it is not clear if this is true or not.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook meme with no additional evidence or data provided to validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that blocking \"Community Standards\" in the Facebook settings can allow users to break platform rules. However, the expert's verdict states that Facebook spokesperson Kevin McAlister called this claim inaccurate, pointing to Facebook's \"Dignity\" section under its community standards.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Facebook's community standards apply to everyone and are designed to be comprehensive. This suggests that even if users block \"Community Standards,\" other policies and guidelines still apply.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Facebook's community standards explicitly state what content violates the platform's rules. Blocking \"Community Standards\" does not change the rules themselves.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effectiveness of blocking \"Community Standards\" by suggesting that it completely eliminates problems with Facebook going against community standards. The expert's verdict does not provide enough information to confirm or refute this exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or examples of when the claim may be inaccurate or inconsistent."}
