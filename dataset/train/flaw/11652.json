{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of surplus that President George W. Bush \"borrowed\" from Social Security. The actual amount is around $708 billion, not $1.37 trillion as claimed in the meme.", "Understate": "The claim understates the alternative explanations for the use of the surplus funds, such as the financial bailout in 2008, in addition to the war in Iraq.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using loose definitions of terms like \"borrow\" and \"raid\" to describe how the Social Security funds are managed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the accusation that President George W. Bush never paid back the borrowed surplus funds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the surplus funds were solely used for tax cuts for the rich and the war in Iraq, without considering other government expenses that may have been funded.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the use of the surplus funds, such as the legal requirement for the U.S. Treasury to issue interest-accruing bonds to the Social Security trust funds in exchange for the surplus."}
