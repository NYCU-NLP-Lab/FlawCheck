{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade. This is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that New Jersey is the only state that spent less on higher education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a decrease in state aid for higher education automatically means less spending on higher education. However, there may be other sources of funding or alternative ways of financing higher education in the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that New Jersey's appropriations for higher education have actually increased over the last decade, contradicting the claim made by Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr."}
