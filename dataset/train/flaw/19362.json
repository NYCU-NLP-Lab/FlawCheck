{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Huntsman made a claim about China being the largest English-speaking nation, but there is no specific evidence or data provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that for Huntsman's statement to be accurate, China would need roughly 300 million English speakers to surpass the United States. This assumes that the number of English speakers in China is close to this figure, which is not supported by any evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions India as a potential alternative explanation, as it has a population of 1.2 billion and multiple official languages, including Hindi. This suggests that India could potentially have a large number of English speakers as well, challenging the claim about China being the largest English-speaking nation."}
