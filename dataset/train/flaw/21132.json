{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Rubio's change in position on immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship. The expert's verdict suggests that Rubio's underlying policy views have remained consistent, but he has changed his opinion on how the legislation should be passed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to definitively state that Rubio was for immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship before he was against it. The expert's verdict provides evidence of Rubio's changing opinions and statements, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of his entire stance on the issue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rubio's change in opinion on the process of passing immigration reform equates to being \"against\" it. The expert's verdict suggests that Rubio's current position is not substantially different from his previous views, but he now prefers a different approach.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Rubio's change in opinion. The expert's verdict mentions Rubio's finesse in delivering his message to different audiences, indicating that his statements may be influenced by political considerations rather than a complete reversal of his stance."}
