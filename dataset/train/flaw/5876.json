{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time, which implies near-complete alignment with the president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion that Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. The evidence provided is based on Congressional Quarterly's analysis, which only covers a specific pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting with Obama 99 percent of the time is indicative of \"loyal and unwavering support\" for the Obama-Biden agenda without considering other factors or nuances in voting decisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Shaheen's voting record, such as potential alignment with party ideology or constituent preferences."}
