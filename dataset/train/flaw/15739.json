{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Priyanka Chaturvedi could not answer the questions of a young boy. The only evidence provided is a tweet from a person named Amar K., which is not substantiated with any additional proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Priyanka Chaturvedi used the boy's image to influence \"new voters\" without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Another man named Raghvendra R Shukla tweeted that the claim is false and that the boy is a part of his family. This alternative explanation suggests that the initial claim made by Amar K. may not be accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the boy is a part of Raghvendra R Shukla's family and not Amar K.'s nephew, as initially claimed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the backlash Priyanka Chaturvedi received on social media based on Amar K.'s tweet.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the initial tweet by claiming that it was retweeted over 4,000 times, without providing evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting accounts and contradictory statements from different individuals involved in the incident."}
