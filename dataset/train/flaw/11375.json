{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of voter fraud in the 2012 U.S. presidential election by stating that \"massive voter fraud has been reported\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that voter fraud occurred in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. The evidence provided is anecdotal and does not present a comprehensive analysis of voter fraud incidents.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of a Photo ID requirement in certain states contributed to voter fraud, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim includes statements that have been proven to be false, such as the assertion that Obama received 100% of the votes in certain districts, which is mathematically and statistically impossible.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of investigations and measures taken to address potential voter fraud in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. It fails to acknowledge the efforts made by states to deploy personnel to investigate election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the observed discrepancies in voter turnout, such as data errors or administrative issues, instead attributing them solely to voter fraud."}
