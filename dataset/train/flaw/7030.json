{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm the accuracy of the statement about Padmashila Tirpude's previous occupation and career progression.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image shared by Priti Gandhi and Dipanshu Kabra depicts Padmashila Tirpude, despite her denial in an interview with Maharasthra Times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as Padmashila Tirpude herself has denied being the person depicted in the image shared on social media."}
