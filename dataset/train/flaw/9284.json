{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of born-again Christians who are not voting by stating that \"roughly half\" are staying home. The expert's analysis suggests that the actual number may be lower than that.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"roughly half\" of born-again Christians are not voting.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all born-again Christians are not voting, without considering potential variations among different subgroups or demographics within the born-again Christian population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the lower voter turnout among born-again Christians, such as increasing ethnic diversity and fewer young Americans affiliating with a religion."}
