{"Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the conflict in Nigeria and the factors contributing to the violence, particularly by focusing solely on religious affiliation as the primary motive for the killings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to establish a direct causal link between Muslim militants and the killings of Christians. The information provided is based on reports from a charity organization and local news reports, which may not be entirely reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the killings of Christians by Muslim militants are the result of religious animosity, without considering alternative explanations or underlying factors such as the herder-farmer conflict over resources and land usage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the ongoing conflict in Nigeria is primarily driven by disputes over natural resources and land usage, rather than religious affiliation. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that religious affiliation is a secondary issue in the conflict and that reports in the U.S. failed to properly explain the complexity of the situation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the killings by stating that 120 Christians were killed in a three-week period, without providing additional context or verification of the numbers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by selectively focusing on atrocities allegedly perpetrated by Muslims against Christians, without mentioning other acts of violence or atrocities committed by different groups in the conflict."}
