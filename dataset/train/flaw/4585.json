{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of private-sale background checks on reducing the number of women shot and killed. The expert's verdict states that \"49 percent fewer women are shot and killed\" in states with private-sale background checks, but it is unclear if this figure accurately represents the impact.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the figure of \"49 percent fewer women are shot and killed\" comes from a report by Everytown for Gun Safety. However, the verdict also mentions that the report only examined firearm homicides of women by intimate partners, and data on gun murders deaths of all women are not available. This lack of comprehensive data may weaken the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship between private-sale background checks and the reduction in women shot and killed. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the report by Everytown for Gun Safety only found a 46 percent lower rate of firearm homicides of women by intimate partners in states with background checks, while the level of non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was only 4.3 percent lower. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the reduction in women shot and killed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the report by Everytown for Gun Safety found a lower rate of firearm homicides of women by intimate partners in states with background checks, but the reduction in non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was much less stark. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors, beyond private-sale background checks, that contribute to the reduction in women shot and killed."}
