{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Howard Zinn's book is \"the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America.\" This may not be supported by sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being an \"anti-American Marxist\" automatically discredits Howard Zinn's work and makes it inappropriate for high school education. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the potential value of critical analysis and alternative perspectives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Howard Zinn's book is the most commonly used textbook in American high schools.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Howard Zinn's book, A People's History of the United States, does have its admirers and is not solely criticized by conservatives."}
