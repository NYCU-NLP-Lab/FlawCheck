{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue by stating that only one out of 60 appropriations bills has been passed on time in the last five years. It may not accurately represent the actual number of bills passed on time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the statement that only one out of 60 appropriations bills has been passed on time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that passing appropriations bills on time is the only measure of effectiveness in the annual government funding process. It may overlook other factors or considerations that contribute to the effectiveness of the process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why appropriations bills may not be passed on time, such as political disagreements, negotiation processes, or external factors that may affect the timeline.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Congress often passes continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills, which may include multiple appropriations bills, instead of individual bills each fiscal year. Therefore, the claim's assertion that only one out of 60 bills has been passed on time may not accurately reflect the overall funding process."}
