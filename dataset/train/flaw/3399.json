{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Tim Pawlenty's actions by stating that he \"eliminated health insurance for 33,000 to 35,000 people.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that while Pawlenty did reduce the size of the health program and limit benefits, care was not entirely eliminated.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Tim Pawlenty's actions by not fully acknowledging the reduction of benefits and limitations imposed on the health program.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that journalists in Minnesota thoroughly covered the political fight over the health care program, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that 33,000 to 35,000 people were affected.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the elimination of funding for the old program was solely the result of Tim Pawlenty's actions, without considering other factors or stakeholders involved in the decision-making process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Pawlenty proposed changing the program to save money and negotiate with the Democratic-controlled legislature, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the reduction of the health program beyond solely Pawlenty's actions."}
