{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which millennials are more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans, as the data shows that seniors are actually slightly more opposed to abortion than millennials.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single survey conducted in 2010, which may not accurately represent the views of all millennials.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being more opposed to abortion morally equates to being more pro-life, which is a problematic assumption as it does not consider the complexity of individuals' beliefs on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the paradoxical findings of other surveys, which show that a significant number of millennials identify with both the pro-life and pro-choice labels."}
