{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE and halting virtually all deportations, including murderers and everyone else.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actions taken by the Biden administration regarding ICE and deportations. It fails to acknowledge that new deportation priorities have been established and that a temporary pause on some deportations has been ordered.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that all deportations have been halted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions taken by the Biden administration regarding ICE and deportations are detrimental or problematic without providing a clear justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as the Biden administration has not shut down ICE and criminals, including murderers, can still be deported. This counters the claim that all deportations have been halted."}
