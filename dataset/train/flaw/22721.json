{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Starbucks is giving away free coffee for a year to anyone who can damage their new \"shatter-proof\" windows. This is not true, as confirmed by the company.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Starbucks is actually running a contest or promotion involving damaging their windows.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Starbucks has new \"shatter-proof\" windows, which is not supported by any evidence or confirmation from the company.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Starbucks confirmed the claim to be false. The expert's verdict states that the company confirmed via email that the claim pushed in the meme was false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, suggesting that it was created as a joke or to make light of the idea of vandalizing Starbucks coffee shops. The expert's verdict mentions that the image circulated in \"anarchist\" groups and was spread online as a fake claim."}
