{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the progress of the wall construction by stating that \"the wall is going up very rapidly\" and that \"we're at 182 miles.\" However, the expert's verdict clarifies that most of the construction has been replacing old and outdated barriers, not adding new ones.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual progress of the wall construction by only mentioning the 182 miles that have been built. The expert's verdict reveals that the total increase in primary barriers during Trump's presidency is only 3 miles, reaching a total of 657 miles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that \"the wall is going up very rapidly.\" The expert's verdict provides data that shows a minimal increase in primary barriers during Trump's presidency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of the wall is a significant achievement by stating that \"the wall is going up\" without considering the fact that most of it is replacing existing barriers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in miles of wall, such as the replacement of dilapidated barriers or the inclusion of secondary and tertiary barriers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the majority of the wall construction is not adding new barriers, but rather replacing old ones."}
