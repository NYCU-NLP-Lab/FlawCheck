However, experts argue that the term \"filibuster\" has evolved over the years and is used more frequently in more partisan Congresses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Sen. Ben Cardin, who argues that both parties are to blame for engaging in similar actions during different presidential terms. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Republicans have filibustered more judicial nominees under President Obama than in the entire history of the United States Senate."}
