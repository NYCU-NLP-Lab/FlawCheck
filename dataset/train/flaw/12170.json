{"Understate": "The claim may understate the level of monitoring and inspection that will be implemented under the Iran deal, as there will be 24/7 monitoring of certain Iranian assets and regular access to relevant buildings at the Natanz facility for 15 years.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not fully acknowledging the specific measures that will be in place for inspections, such as electronic seals and other IAEA-approved technologies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to back up the assertion that the Iran deal violates promises made by the president to the American people, as the provided information focuses more on the inspection process rather than the overall promises of the deal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that an \"anytime, anywhere\" inspection process is necessary or feasible in arms control agreements, without considering the specific circumstances and sensitivities involved in the Iran deal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the negotiation process and the inclusion of specific inspection measures, as Secretary of State John Kerry stated that the term \"anytime, anywhere\" was not on the table during the negotiations."}
