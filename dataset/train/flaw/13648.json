{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Yogi Adityanath was laughing at the funeral of a Pulwama martyr, when in fact the video was unrelated to the Pulwama attack and was from a different event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video and a tweet from a Youth Congress leader without any additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Yogi Adityanath was disrespecting the martyr by laughing, without considering the possibility that the laughter was unrelated to the funeral or the Pulwama attack.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it was from a different event and not related to the Pulwama attack."}
