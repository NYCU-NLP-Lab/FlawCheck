{"Falters at times": "The claim suggests that the St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll has been wrong in almost every election, indicating a potential inconsistency in its accuracy.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute the claim. It only presents the opinion of Governor Scott Walker and the Republican Party spokesman, without additional data or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the St. Norbert poll's historical inaccuracies in previous elections make it fundamentally a \"bad\" poll, without considering other factors that may contribute to its performance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that a separate poll conducted by Public Policy Polling showed different results, indicating that different polling methodologies and target groups can lead to varying outcomes. This suggests the existence of alternative explanations for the St. Norbert poll's results."}
