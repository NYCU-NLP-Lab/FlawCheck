{"Understate": "The claim may understate the reduction in carbon intensity by stating it as \"roughly 40 percent\" when the actual reduction has been around 40 percent since 1990.", "Lack enough support": "There is no evidence provided to support the claim of a 40 percent reduction in carbon intensity under Gillum's leadership.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gillum's leadership was solely responsible for the reduction in carbon intensity, without considering other factors or initiatives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Susan Glickman suggests that there could be other factors contributing to the reduction in carbon emissions, indicating the presence of alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the reduction in carbon intensity has been over the course of two decades, not just under Gillum's leadership.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by initially making an eye-popping statistic of a 40 percent reduction, but then rolling back the claim and providing a broader talking point that still leaves questions unanswered.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Gillum's role in the reduction of carbon intensity by attributing it solely to his leadership."}
