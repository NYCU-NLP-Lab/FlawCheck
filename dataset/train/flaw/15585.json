{"Understate": "The claim may understate the current number of police officers in Nigeria by stating that there are only 187 policemen for every 100,000 Nigerians, while the UN recommends a ratio of 300 police officers to 100,000 people. This implies that there is a shortage of police officers in Nigeria.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement about the current ratio of police officers in Nigeria. It does not provide any specific sources or statistics to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the UN recommendation of 300 police officers to 100,000 people is the ideal ratio for Nigeria without considering the specific context or factors that may influence the optimal number of police officers in the country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the number of police officers between Nigeria and the UN recommendation. There could be various factors, such as budget constraints, resource allocation, or different policing strategies, that contribute to the current ratio in Nigeria.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nigeria has a lower GDP per capita compared to Singapore. This information is provided by the expert's verdict and suggests that Nigeria may face economic challenges that could impact its ability to allocate resources to increase the number of police officers.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
