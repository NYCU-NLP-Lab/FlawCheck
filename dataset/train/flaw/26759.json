{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"abortion services are 'well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does'\" is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures provided by Planned Parenthood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that abortion services are the primary focus of Planned Parenthood, while the expert's verdict provides evidence that preventive services make up the majority of their work.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that abortion services constitute over 90 percent of Planned Parenthood's work. The expert's verdict provides a breakdown of the various services provided by Planned Parenthood, which contradicts the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the purpose and services provided by Planned Parenthood, such as preventive care, contraception, and cancer screenings, which the expert's verdict highlights as significant aspects of their work."}
