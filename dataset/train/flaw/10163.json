{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the incident by stating that the men kicked the food, while the video only shows one person kicking the food on the table.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the men refused to eat the food because it was cooked by a Dalit woman, without providing enough evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the incident was specifically motivated by religious or caste bias.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the incident, stating that there is no Dalit-Muslim angle to the incident according to the police."}
