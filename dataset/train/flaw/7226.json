{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual position of Danny O'Connor regarding making Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions that O'Connor's tweet supported a policy from the mayor of Columbus, which was related to supporting refugees and not specifically about sanctuary cities. Therefore, the claim may be understating O'Connor's stance on the issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Danny O'Connor would make Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions that the tweet from O'Connor did not specifically mention sanctuary cities, and the mayor's executive order made it clear that the city would not investigate or cooperate in an investigation unless certain conditions were met. Therefore, there is a lack of direct evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Danny O'Connor supports making Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants based on a tweet that supported a policy related to supporting refugees. This assumption may be problematic as it does not directly establish O'Connor's stance on sanctuary cities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for Danny O'Connor's tweet and his support for the mayor's policy. The expert's verdict mentions that the mayor's executive order made it clear that the city would not investigate or cooperate in an investigation unless certain conditions were met. This alternative explanation suggests that O'Connor's support may be related to the city's stance on supporting refugees and not specifically about making Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants."}
