{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the Chelsea Manning leaks by stating that the Taliban specifically targeted and murdered individuals identified in the leaks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the Taliban actually went after and murdered people based on the leaked information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the leaks and the deaths, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there is an alternative explanation to the claim, as there is no evidence found that the Taliban acted on the threats made in response to the leaks."}
