{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which rosaries are specifically targeted by immigration authorities. The expert's verdict states that rosaries are among other belongings confiscated, but they are not specifically targeted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that immigration authorities are taking rosaries away from immigrants at the border. The expert's verdict provides information about the confiscation of personal belongings, including rosaries, but it does not confirm the claim directly.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigration authorities are intentionally taking rosaries away from immigrants at the border. The expert's verdict suggests that rosaries are confiscated along with other personal effects when immigrants are arrested, but it does not indicate any intentionality or targeting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that rosaries are among other personal effects confiscated when immigrants are taken into custody. This suggests that the confiscation of rosaries is not specifically aimed at targeting the religious aspect but is a part of the overall confiscation process."}
