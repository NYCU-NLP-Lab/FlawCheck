{"Understates": "The claim \"The (border) fence is now basically complete\" understates the actual progress of the fence construction, as there are conflicting statements about its completion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the completion of certain sections of the fence represents the overall completion of the entire border fence, which is a problematic assumption due to differing opinions on the matter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively declare the fence as \"basically complete\" since there are conflicting statements and differing interpretations of what constitutes completion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Senator Jim DeMint, who argues that the border fence is not complete and that only a small percentage of the double-layer fencing has been constructed.", "Contradicts fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are still ongoing debates and disagreements about the completion of the border fence, as highlighted by the conflicting statements from President Obama and Senator DeMint.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent assessment of the completion of the border fence, as there are differing opinions and interpretations of the progress made."}
