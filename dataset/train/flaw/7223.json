{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the achievement jump by stating it as the \"biggest single-year jump ever recorded in the state.\" It is possible that there have been other instances of significant achievement jumps in the past, but they may not have been recorded or documented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that Tennessee's students made the biggest achievement jump ever recorded. It relies on the statement made by U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan without providing additional sources or research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the achievement jump is solely due to the implementation of the new teacher evaluation system. It does not consider other factors or alternative explanations that may have contributed to the improvement in student achievement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore other potential factors or explanations for the achievement jump, such as changes in curriculum, teaching methods, or student demographics. It attributes the improvement solely to the new teacher evaluation system."}
