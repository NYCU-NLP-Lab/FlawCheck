{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential threat of an eruption from Mount Timolan by stating that scientists are worried about it. However, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has stated that the warnings circulating on social media are baseless and that Mount Timolan is an inactive volcano with no historical record of eruption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a Facebook post that has been shared over 1,000 times. The post does not provide any credible evidence or sources to back up its claims about Mount Timolan being a volcano and the potential dangers it poses.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mount Timolan is a volcano that scientists are concerned about, despite the fact that it is classified as an inactive volcano by Phivolcs and is not included in their list of active volcanoes in the Philippines.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim contradicts the official information provided by Phivolcs, which states that Mount Timolan is an inactive volcano and there is no reason to cause alarm. This alternative explanation undermines the claim's assertion that scientists are worried about a potential eruption.", "Understate": "The claim understates the credibility and expertise of Phivolcs, the government agency responsible for monitoring volcanic hazards in the Philippines. Phivolcs has not issued any hazard advisory related to Mount Timolan and has stated that the misleading posts about its volcanic activity are baseless.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a Facebook post and disregarding the official information and statements from Phivolcs. It fails to critically evaluate the credibility and accuracy of the sources used to support its claims about Mount Timolan being a volcano.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mount Timolan is an inactive volcano with no historical record of eruption, as confirmed by Phivolcs. The warnings circulating on social media are baseless and do not align with the scientific information provided by the official government agency."}
