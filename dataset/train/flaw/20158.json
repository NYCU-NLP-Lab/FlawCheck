{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential increase in insurance premiums by stating that Ohioans can expect to pay up to 41 percent more when Obamacare takes effect. The actual increase only applies to a small percentage of the population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not take into account subsidies that will lessen the costs for many people who buy their policies in the exchange.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 41 percent increase applies to all Ohioans, when in reality it only applies to individuals buying health insurance policies on the new state marketplace.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations such as the impact of subsidies on reducing out-of-pocket costs for individuals."}
