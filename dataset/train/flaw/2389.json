{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the World Health Organization (WHO) by stating that they \"admitted\" that lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The WHO actually mentioned the potential economic consequences of lockdowns but did not explicitly admit that they are killing countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. It does not provide specific data or studies to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cure (lockdowns) is worse than the problem (COVID-19). This assumption may not be universally true and can vary depending on the specific circumstances and context of each country or region.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the economic consequences mentioned. It solely attributes the consequences to lockdowns without considering other factors such as global economic downturn, reduced consumer spending, or supply chain disruptions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the WHO does not advocate for lockdowns as the primary means of control for the virus. The WHO only supports lockdowns as a temporary measure to buy time for reorganization and resource balancing.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic by suggesting that the economic consequences of lockdowns outweigh the potential health consequences. It does not fully acknowledge the significant impact of the virus on public health and healthcare systems."}
