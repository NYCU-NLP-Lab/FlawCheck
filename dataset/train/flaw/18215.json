{"Lack enough support": "The claim that deaths following COVID-19 vaccination are because of the vaccine lacks sufficient evidence or support. The expert's verdict provides multiple instances where investigations and reviews have not found any evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and deaths.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that deaths following COVID-19 vaccination are directly caused by the vaccine without considering other factors or underlying health conditions. The expert's verdict highlights ongoing investigations and reviews that have not found any association between the deaths and the vaccine.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations for the reported deaths, such as the advanced age and frailty of the individuals, which could contribute to their deaths. Additionally, it mentions that in some cases, the deaths were not related to the vaccine based on autopsy findings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of investigations and reviews conducted by reputable organizations such as the Norwegian Medicines Agency, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the World Health Organization. These organizations did not find any evidence to support the claim that deaths were caused by the vaccine.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the lack of evidence or support for the assertion that deaths are directly caused by the vaccine. The expert's verdict emphasizes the absence of statistical analyses indicating an increased risk of death among vaccinated individuals and the lack of unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities reported.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the association between deaths and COVID-19 vaccination by not considering alternative explanations or the lack of evidence supporting the claim. The expert's verdict provides multiple instances where investigations and reviews have found no causal relationship between the vaccine and deaths.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing substantial evidence or addressing the investigations and reviews that have found no evidence of a causal relationship between deaths and the vaccine. The expert's verdict points out the lack of statistical analyses supporting the claim and the ongoing investigations that have not found any association."}
