{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of bills vetoed by Gov. McAuliffe by comparing it to the previous three governors' four-year terms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between Gov. McAuliffe's veto record and the previous three governors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that vetoing more bills is indicative of being \"heavy-handed\" or problematic, without considering the reasons behind the vetoes or the context of the bills.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Gov. McAuliffe's high number of vetoes, such as differences in political climate or the content of the bills being passed by the General Assembly."}
