{"Understate": "The claim may understate the financial benefits that student-athletes receive from the NCAA, as they receive athletic scholarship dollars, grant-in-aid, and other forms of financial support.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the NCAA will \"get billions\" from the men's basketball tournament, as the financial statements provided only show revenues of nearly $770 million in 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only benefit for players is a trophy, disregarding the financial support they receive through scholarships and other funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the revenues generated by the NCAA, such as distribution to member colleges and universities, rather than solely benefiting the NCAA itself."}
