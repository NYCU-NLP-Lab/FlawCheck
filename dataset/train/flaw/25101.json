{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Iraq has been completely overrun by ISIS solely because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement. This exaggerates the role of Clinton's actions in the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexities and challenges involved in renegotiating a status of forces agreement, as well as the role of other factors in the rise of ISIS in Iraq.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by oversimplifying the situation and failing to acknowledge the multiple factors and actors involved in the negotiations and the rise of ISIS.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal link between Clinton's failure to renegotiate a status of forces agreement and the complete overrun of Iraq by ISIS.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a successfully renegotiated status of forces agreement would have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, which may be a problematic assumption given the complex nature of the conflict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise of ISIS in Iraq, such as the sectarian divisions, political instability, and regional dynamics that contributed to the group's emergence."}
