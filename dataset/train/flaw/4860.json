{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"dark money is paying for over 80 percent of Kavanaugh's ads\" lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The article mentions that the total amount of money spent in support of Kavanaugh's nomination is unknown, and the dark money groups are not required to report their expenditures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all pro-Kavanaugh ads are funded by dark money. However, the article mentions that some groups, like the National Republican Congressional Committee, have also spent on advertisements in support of Kavanaugh, and they are required to disclose their donors and expenditures.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the influence of dark money in the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. While the exact percentage of dark money funding is unknown, the article suggests that it played a significant role in the confirmation fight, according to an analyst at the Center for Responsive Politics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that some ads supporting Kavanaugh may be funded by sources other than dark money, such as disclosed donors or organizations that are not required to report their expenditures.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the extent of dark money funding for Kavanaugh's ads. The article acknowledges the lack of complete accounting and the difficulty in estimating the total ad budget favoring Kavanaugh.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of ads funded by dark money by stating that it is \"over 80 percent,\" without sufficient evidence or data to support this specific figure."}
