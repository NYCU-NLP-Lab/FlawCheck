{"Understate": "The claim may understate the level of understanding among Brexit voters by suggesting that many people didn't know why they voted for Brexit based solely on a spike in Google searches.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that people didn't know why they voted for Brexit. It relies on a spike in Google searches without considering other factors or conducting a comprehensive survey.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim doesn't consider alternative explanations for the spike in Google searches, such as people seeking more information after the Brexit vote or wanting to understand the consequences of their decision.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spike in Google searches directly indicates a lack of knowledge or understanding among Brexit voters, without considering other factors that may have influenced the searches.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying solely on Google Trends data without considering the limitations and potential biases of this data source.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which people didn't know why they voted for Brexit based on a single data point of Google search spikes. It doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of voter knowledge or understanding.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it cannot be determined from Google Trends data alone whether the searches were done by Brexit voters or other individuals."}
