{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the federal government by stating that they are \"going after school districts\" and \"trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that the federal government is targeting school districts in this way.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing transgender students to use the locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity is equivalent to \"boys showering with girls,\" which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that Senator Ted Cruz's statement may be alluding to the administration's support of transgender students suing their school districts for access to restrooms and locker rooms, rather than a direct attempt by the government to force coed showers."}
