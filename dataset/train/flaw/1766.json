{"Understate": "The claim may understate the involvement of the Department of Education in Washington in the creation of the Common Core. The expert's verdict mentions that Common Core came out of years of discussion between private, nonprofit groups and state education departments, but it does not provide a clear statement about the level of involvement of the Department of Education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the involvement of governors and states in putting together the Common Core standards automatically excludes the Department of Education in Washington. However, the expert's verdict does not provide enough information to confirm or refute this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that the Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington. The expert's verdict provides some information about the involvement of governors and states, but it does not provide comprehensive evidence to support or contradict the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the Department of Education in Washington may have played a role in the creation of the Common Core standards. The expert's verdict does not provide enough information to confirm or refute this alternative explanation."}
