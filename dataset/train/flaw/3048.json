{"Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the decrease in health visitor numbers by simply stating that it is the lowest number since August 2013, without providing further context or comparison to previous years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks additional data or evidence to support the statement about the decrease in health visitor numbers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decrease in health visitor numbers could be attributed to factors such as lower numbers of nurses from the EU joining the UK nursing register and an increase in EU staff leaving the NHS. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in health visitor numbers is solely due to a decline in the NHS, without considering other possible factors or external influences.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the figures for health visitor numbers in December 2017 are roughly the same as those in December 2015. This contradicts the claim that the numbers are the lowest since August 2013.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
