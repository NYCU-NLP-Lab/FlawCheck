{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the content of the video by stating that it shows children frozen and their organs being sold. The video actually shows unrelated incidents of men being beaten up and a dead child being placed in an ice-filled box.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that children are frozen and their organs are sold. The video does not provide any evidence or proof of such activities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video footage is evidence of children being frozen and their organs being sold. However, the expert's investigation reveals that the video consists of unrelated incidents and is not related to child abduction or organ trafficking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it shows incidents of mistaken identity and assault, rather than child abduction or organ sale."}
