{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove its validity. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the photograph was created as a joke and not an actual advertisement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sign warning Irish motorists not to drive after having five pints of beer is authentic and from 1972. However, the expert's verdict debunks this assumption by pointing out that the image was created by comedians and that there are several factors indicating it was a joke.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that an official government body, especially in Ireland, would not encourage people to drink and drive. The expert's verdict highlights the unlikelihood of such a government endorsement, even in 1972.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance or prevalence of the warning sign. The expert's verdict mentions that the image has circulated on the internet multiple times, indicating that it gained attention but does not specify its widespread impact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the origin and nature of the photograph, stating that it was created by comedians and not an actual advertisement.", "Understate": "There is no clear indication of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting accurate information since the sign is not authentic. The expert's verdict points out the misconceptions associated with the photo and debunks its origins."}
