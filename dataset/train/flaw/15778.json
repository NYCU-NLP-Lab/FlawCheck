{"Understate": "The claim may understate the historical data and political trends in Hawaii regarding incumbents' re-election rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to prove that Hawaii does not have a history of throwing incumbents out of office.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hawaii's unique circumstances and special election are not indicative of a political mood swing in the state, which could be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that Djou's victory could be attributed to factors other than Hawaii's history of incumbents' re-election, such as the absence of a primary and the presence of multiple Democratic candidates."}
