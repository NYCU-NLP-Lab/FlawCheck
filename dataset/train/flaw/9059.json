{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company create a sweatshop in Haiti. The expert's verdict suggests that while Clinton did support the project and may have lobbied for it, the decision to place the industrial park in Caracol and any resulting environmental issues were made by the government of Haiti, not solely by Clinton.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the creation of the industrial park in Haiti amounted to a sweatshop, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict highlights the accusations and concerns raised about the project, but does not definitively confirm or refute the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Hillary Clinton specifically set aside environmental and labor rules to help the South Korean company. The expert's verdict mentions Clinton's support for the project and her role in promoting garment making in Haiti, but does not provide direct evidence of her involvement in setting aside rules or creating a sweatshop.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the decision to place the industrial park in Caracol and any resulting environmental issues were made by the government of Haiti, not solely by Clinton. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Clinton was solely responsible for setting aside rules and creating a sweatshop."}
