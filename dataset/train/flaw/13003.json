{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount that Barack Obama added to the national debt. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama added about $5 trillion to the debt in less than four years, which is less than the claimed $16 trillion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Gov. Rick Perry posted a photo showing the total federal debt, but it does not provide additional evidence or sources to support the claim that Obama added $16 trillion to the national debt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $16 trillion increase in the national debt is solely attributed to Barack Obama, without considering any other factors or contributors to the debt.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the increase in the national debt, such as factors like wars, tax cuts, and the financial crisis of 2008-09. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the debt increase, rather than solely attributing it to Obama."}
