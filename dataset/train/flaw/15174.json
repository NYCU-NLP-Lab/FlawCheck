{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the contrast between Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and Frank Guinta by stating that Shea-Porter \"votes with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Democrats 95 percent of the time,\" implying that Guinta has a significantly different voting pattern. However, the expert's verdict reveals that Guinta's voting record is not significantly different, as he also voted with his party around 96-97 percent of the time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to justify the assertion that Frank Guinta will \"take on both parties\" and has \"independent New Hampshire values.\" The expert's verdict does not provide evidence or examples to support these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting with one's party most of the time is a negative trait, implying that Shea-Porter's voting record is problematic. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided view by suggesting that Shea-Porter's voting record is aligned with Nancy Pelosi's Democrats, without considering potential reasons or circumstances for her voting choices. The expert's verdict does not provide an alternative explanation for Shea-Porter's voting pattern, but it highlights that Guinta's voting record is similar to Shea-Porter's.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Frank Guinta's voting record is not significantly different from Shea-Porter's, as both have high partisan unity scores. The claim suggests that Guinta will take on both parties, but the expert's verdict shows that he has voted with his party at a similar rate to Shea-Porter."}
