{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support Warren Buffett has for Obama, as it is presented as a definitive statement (\"Warren still does support me\") without providing any specific evidence or details about the extent of that support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Warren Buffett's support is significant and relevant to the topic at hand (Obama's plan for solving the banking crisis), without providing sufficient justification for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to substantiate the statement that Warren Buffett still supports Obama. It only includes Obama's own assertion and a brief mention of Buffett's endorsement during the campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Warren Buffett's criticism of Obama's handling of the banking crisis, such as differing perspectives or concerns about specific aspects of the plan."}
