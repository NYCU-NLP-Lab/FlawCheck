{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows Pakistani and Indian Prime Ministers having dinner together contradicts the fact that the photo has been doctored and actually shows Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan with his then-wife Reham Khan.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by implying that it shows a rare event of the two Prime Ministers dining together.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a doctored photo and does not provide any credible evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo is real and accurately depicts the two Prime Ministers having dinner together, which is a problematic assumption given the evidence of photo manipulation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the photo has been manipulated and does not show what it claims to show."}
