{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Ron Johnson voted for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas. The expert's verdict mentions that Johnson voted against procedural measures to block legislation, which suggests that he did not actively support such tax breaks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that the legislation proposed in 2012 and 2014, which Johnson voted against, failed on procedural votes. This indicates that the claim may not have strong evidence to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax breaks voted on by Johnson directly help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas. The expert's verdict mentions that the legislation targeted \"tax loopholes\" that allow corporations to shift jobs and profits overseas, but it does not explicitly state that the tax breaks voted on by Johnson directly facilitate job outsourcing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Johnson voted against denying deductions for costs associated with outsourcing, which could be seen as an alternative explanation for his votes. This suggests that there may be other reasons for Johnson's votes on tax breaks that help companies ship jobs overseas."}
