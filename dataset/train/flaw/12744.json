{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Congress was \"never allowed\" to debate or discuss the Iran nuclear deal under President Obama. This is an overstatement as Congress did have the opportunity to review and discuss the agreement through the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015.", "Understate": "The claim understates the role of Congress in the Iran nuclear deal by implying that they had no voice or engagement under President Obama. In reality, Congress had the ability to review and potentially block the agreement through the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Congress was \"never allowed\" to debate or discuss the Iran nuclear deal. The evidence provided shows that Congress did have the opportunity to review and have some authority over the agreement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that President Obama intentionally bypassed Congress and did not allow them to have a say in the Iran nuclear deal. This assumption is not supported by the evidence, which shows that Congress had the ability to review and discuss the agreement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that President Obama and his administration followed the established process for international agreements and involved Congress through the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. The claim fails to acknowledge this alternative explanation."}
