{"Understate": "The claim understates the reality of climate change by dismissing it as \"nothing but a bunch of computer models\" and implying that it is not currently happening.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence to support the assertion that climate change predictions are solely based on computer models and are not accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that climate change predictions are intentionally made for a distant future to avoid accountability, without providing any evidence for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that climate change is already happening and its impacts can be observed globally.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that climate change predictions are always for a distant future and that none of us will be alive to know if they were true, disregarding the fact that climate change impacts are already being observed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by ignoring the consensus among climate scientists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change regarding the human contribution to global warming.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks alternative explanations for climate change, such as the role of human activities and carbon dioxide emissions, which are supported by scientific evidence."}
