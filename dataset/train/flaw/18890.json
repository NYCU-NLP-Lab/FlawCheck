{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which jailing parents was an \"unintended consequence\" of the 2010 state truancy law sponsored by Sen. Kamala Harris.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that jailing parents was an unintended consequence of the law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that jailing parents was not an intended outcome of the truancy law, which is contradicted by evidence that the law included provisions for fines and imprisonment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the jailing of parents, such as the failure of the education and intervention stages of the truancy program, or the specific circumstances of individual cases."}
