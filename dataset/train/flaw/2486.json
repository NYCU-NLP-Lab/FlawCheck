{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which China owns more of US bonds than Americans. While China is the largest foreign owner of US Treasury securities, it does not own more US debt than domestic investors.", "Understate": "The claim understates the amount of US debt held by domestic investors. The expert's analysis shows that the majority of privately-held US debt is owned by United States investors such as banks, pension funds, and mutual funds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that China owns more US bonds than Americans. The expert's analysis provides evidence that refutes this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that China owning more US bonds than Americans is not a good position to be in. This is a subjective assumption that may not be universally agreed upon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that when the former governor said China held more bonds than Americans, he was referring to debt held by ordinary American investors."}
