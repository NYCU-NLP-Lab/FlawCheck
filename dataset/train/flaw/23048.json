{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the gender wage gap by stating that women make only 78 percent of what men make for the same job. The expert's verdict suggests that the wage gap tends to diminish when comparing women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that women make only 78 percent of what men make for the same job.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 78 percent wage gap applies to all men and women in the same job, without considering factors such as experience, education, and other variables that could influence pay differences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the wage gap is not solely due to discrimination but can be attributed to factors such as different levels of experience, education, and the number of hours worked.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the wage gap by only mentioning a 78 percent difference, while the expert's verdict mentions a larger wage gap reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, which showed women's total wages were about 23 percent lower than men's wages.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that the 78 percent wage gap statistic is an urban myth perpetuated by politicians and advocacy groups misreading Census data.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting an anecdotal scenario of a woman discovering a 78 percent wage gap, which may not be representative of the overall situation."}
