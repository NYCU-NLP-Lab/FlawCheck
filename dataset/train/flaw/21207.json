{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in tax breaks between wealthy individuals and the middle-class by stating that Republicans approved tax breaks 12 times larger for those making over $350,000 compared to the average middle-class person.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Republicans approved tax breaks 12 times larger for wealthy individuals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the size of tax breaks directly correlates with the benefit received by different income groups, without considering the overall tax burden or other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the second tax cut approved by the GOP in 2014, which dropped the rate for the lowest part of people's incomes. This alternative explanation could impact the comparison between tax breaks for different income groups."}
