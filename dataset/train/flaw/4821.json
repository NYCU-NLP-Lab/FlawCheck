{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that Gina Haspel has a warrant for her arrest in Germany. The expert's verdict mentions that a human rights advocacy group has called for her to be taken into custody if she travels to Europe, but it is unclear if an actual arrest warrant exists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gina Haspel's alleged actions at the secret CIA facility in 2002 constitute war crimes. This assumption is not proven or supported by concrete evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Gina Haspel has a warrant for her arrest in Germany. The expert's verdict mentions the call by a human rights advocacy group, but it does not provide any concrete evidence of an arrest warrant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the actions and responsibilities of Gina Haspel during her time at the CIA. The expert's verdict mentions that some reports about her role at the secret facility were retracted, indicating that there may be differing accounts or interpretations of her involvement.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the controversy surrounding Gina Haspel's nomination to head the CIA. The expert's verdict describes her as controversial even by the standards of the Trump administration's embattled nominees, suggesting that the controversy goes beyond just her alleged involvement in the secret facility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Gina Haspel was nominated by President Donald Trump to be the head of the CIA in March 2018. The claim implies that she is facing an arrest warrant, which contradicts her nomination to a high-level position.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by presenting information without clear context or evidence. It states that Gina Haspel's record has come under question both in the US and abroad, but does not provide specific details or sources to support this statement."}
