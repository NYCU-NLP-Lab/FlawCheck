{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the President's aviation policies by suggesting that they were responsible for the zero deaths in 2017, when in reality, there have been no deaths from U.S. commercial airline accidents since 2009 and none from foreign air carriers in the U.S. since 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to directly link the President's strict aviation policies to the zero deaths in 2017. The provided evidence only shows that there were no deaths from commercial passenger jet accidents worldwide, but it does not specifically attribute it to the President's policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the zero deaths in 2017, such as the ongoing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organizations and the aviation industry, as mentioned by the ASN President in the press release. The claim fails to acknowledge these alternative factors that may have contributed to the improved safety record."}
