{"Exaggeration": "The claim of a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in inner-city schools is significantly higher than the statewide high school dropout rate of 6.3 percent reported by the Texas Education Agency.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on selected graduation rates from specific high schools in the Houston, Dallas, and Fort Worth school districts, without providing a comprehensive analysis of dropout rates across all inner-city schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that graduation rates directly reflect dropout rates, without considering other factors such as students transferring to other schools or pursuing alternative education options.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Texas Education Agency and the Children at Risk Institute have different methodologies for calculating graduation rates, which could explain the discrepancy in reported dropout rates."}
