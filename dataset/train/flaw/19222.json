{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of temporary mortgage modifications that have defaulted. The expert's verdict questions the accuracy of the claim and suggests that the numbers provided by Rubio may be inflated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that over half of the 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications have defaulted. The expert's verdict refers to a report that provides different numbers and contradicts Rubio's claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high number of defaults on temporary mortgage modifications is a significant issue without providing further context or analysis. The expert's verdict highlights the need to tackle the foreclosure crisis but does not explicitly state whether the claim's assumption is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high default rate on temporary mortgage modifications. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations either.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately presenting the situation regarding temporary mortgage modifications and their default rates. The expert's verdict questions the accuracy of Rubio's numbers and suggests that the claim may not be entirely reliable.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided in the expert's verdict, which cites a report stating that only approximately 207,000 ongoing permanent modifications have been made, rather than the claim's assertion of over 1.3 million temporary modifications.", "Understate": "There is no indication that the claim is understating any information."}
