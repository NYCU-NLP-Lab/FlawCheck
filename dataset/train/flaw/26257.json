{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of tax credits sent overseas by stating that \"billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries\" when the actual amount is $2.3 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that \"tens of millions of dollars\" were sent to build traffic lights in China.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the stimulus bill sending tax credits overseas is a negative thing without providing any context or alternative explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be interpreted differently, suggesting that the traffic lights were built in China for American streets, rather than U.S.-funded lights on Chinese streets."}
