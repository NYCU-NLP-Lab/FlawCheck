{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the prosecutor's statement by presenting it as a definitive fact rather than a disputed claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the prosecutor was forced out specifically for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct connection between Joe Biden's pressure on Ukraine to fire the prosecutor and his son's involvement in the company, without providing substantial evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the prosecutor's dismissal, such as the broader corruption concerns or the consensus among international organizations and governments that the prosecutor was ineffective in tackling corruption."}
