{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the 25% tariff on imported steel by stating that the industry was \"dead\" and now it is \"thriving.\" The expert's verdict states that while the tariffs have benefited the industry, the impact is not as stark as claimed.", "Understate": "The claim understates the state of the steel industry before the tariffs were implemented. The expert's verdict mentions that the industry was not \"dead\" or \"going out of business\" before the tariffs, and that the entire industry would not have been \"gone\" if Trump had not been elected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that the steel industry was \"dead\" before the tariffs. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the industry was not in such a dire state before the tariffs were implemented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 25% tariff was the sole reason for the improvement in the steel industry. The expert's verdict mentions other factors such as increased productivity and decreased imports that contributed to the industry's improvement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the improvement in the steel industry. The expert's verdict mentions the existence of two industries within the steel industry and how the electric arc furnace based industry has been thriving.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the steel industry was not \"dead\" before the tariffs were implemented. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the industry was not in such a dire state."}
