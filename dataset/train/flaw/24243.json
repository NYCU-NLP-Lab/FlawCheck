{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Chris Christie was the \"first governor in America to endorse\" Mitt Romney is exaggerated. Christie was one of the first Republican governors to endorse Romney, but not the first.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by the fact that two other Republican governors, Dave Heineman and Butch Otter, had already endorsed Romney before Christie.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because Christie's office did not respond to the email presenting the findings that his claim is incorrect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the first governor to endorse Romney is significant and implies a strong belief in the Republican nominee. However, this assumption is problematic as it does not necessarily reflect the governor's true beliefs or the effectiveness of the endorsement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, which is that Christie may have made the statement to emphasize his support for Romney and his dedication to campaigning for him."}
