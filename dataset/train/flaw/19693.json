{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference in earnings between state employees and private sector employees by stating that they earn \"about 8 percent less.\" The expert's verdict mentions that one report found state workers across the country are paid 11 percent less than private-sector workers, while another report found a 7.6 percent difference if pay plus benefits are considered. This suggests that the claim may be downplaying the actual difference in earnings.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim provides a specific percentage (8 percent), the expert's verdict mentions that the basis for this statement is two reports released in 2010 by Washington, D.C. organizations. It is unclear if these reports provide enough comprehensive data to support the claim for all state employees in Wisconsin.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that state employees in Wisconsin earn \"about 8 percent less\" than if they worked in the private sector. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the average government worker has more education and earns a higher salary than a private-sector worker. This suggests that the claim may not take into account the differences in qualifications and job requirements between the two sectors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the average government worker has more education and earns a higher salary than a private-sector worker. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim's assertion of state employees earning less in the private sector may not consider the differences in qualifications and job requirements that contribute to the disparity in earnings."}
