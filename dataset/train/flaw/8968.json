{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that North Carolina could save \"literally tens of millions of dollars\" if it stopped prosecuting 16-year-olds as adults. The expert's verdict provides evidence that past reforms to the juvenile-justice system led to long-term savings of more than $40 million, but it does not directly support the claim that North Carolina could save \"tens of millions of dollars\" by making this specific change.", "Lack enough support": "While the expert's verdict provides evidence of past cost savings and lower recidivism rates associated with juvenile programs, it does not provide specific data or studies to support the claim that North Carolina could save \"tens of millions of dollars\" by changing the prosecution of 16-year-olds.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that treating 16-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system is costly and ineffective, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that cost has been a concern in the past when attempting to change the law. It acknowledges that expanding the juvenile-justice system can be more personalized and focused on rehabilitation, potentially resulting in greater costs per person compared to the prison system. This alternative explanation suggests that cost may not be the sole factor in determining whether to prosecute 16-year-olds as adults."}
