{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the bee population decline by stating that if bees were to disappear, humans would have only 4 years left to live.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to back up the assertion that feeding bees sugar water is an effective solution to revive exhausted bees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in bee populations is solely responsible for the potential extinction of humans, without considering other factors or dependencies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim falsely attributes the statement to Sir David Attenborough, when in fact he does not have any official social media profiles and the posts were misleading."}
