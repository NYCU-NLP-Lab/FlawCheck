{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the research project has only been tested on pig skin and has not been subject to rigorous trials.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tattoo ink can reliably indicate glucose levels, but this assumption is based on a research project that is still at a relatively early stage and has not been tested on human skin.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations of the research project by not mentioning that it is still in the \"proof of concept stage\" and has not yet been tested on humans.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive explanation of the research project and its current stage of development.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the research project is still in progress and has not yet been tested on humans, while the claim implies that the ink is already available for people with diabetes to use.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential of the tattoo ink by presenting it as a fully-functioning biosensor that can reliably monitor glucose levels, while the research project is still in its early stages and has not undergone rigorous testing."}
