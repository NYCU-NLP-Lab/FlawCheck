{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the discovery that the moai statues on Easter Island have bodies. The expert's verdict emphasizes that the misconception that the statues are just giant heads is widespread, indicating that the true nature of the statues is not well-known.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or references to support the assertion that the moai statues on Easter Island have bodies. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides more detailed information and references to the Easter Island Statue Project (EISP) as evidence of the excavation and study of the statues.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the discovery of bodies on the moai statues is recent. The expert's verdict clarifies that the revelation is not a recent discovery and that many of the statues have been displayed in their entirety, including the bodies and even arms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not present any alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding the nature of the moai statues. The expert's verdict, however, provides alternative explanations for the misconception, such as the popularity of images showing only the heads, the disproportionate size of the heads, and the statues being partially buried."}
