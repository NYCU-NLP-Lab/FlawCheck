{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the issue by stating that \"despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created\" in the last 12 years through Chicago's Affordable Requirements Ordinance. It implies that the amount of money invested should have resulted in a higher number of units.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the effectiveness of the Affordable Requirements Ordinance by suggesting that only 400 family units have been created in the last 12 years. It does not provide information on other potential benefits or impacts of the ordinance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that only 400 family units have been created through the Affordable Requirements Ordinance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of family units created is the sole measure of success for the Affordable Requirements Ordinance. It does not consider other factors or goals of the program.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the low number of family units created, such as potential challenges, limitations, or external factors that may have influenced the outcome."}
