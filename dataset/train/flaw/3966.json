{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide concrete evidence or data to prove that checking voter registration citizenship status is one of the main functions of the Department of Homeland Security's SAVE database.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of SAVE for voter registration purposes is justified because it is one of the primary uses of the database. However, this assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative methods or the effectiveness of SAVE in accurately determining citizenship status.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the use of SAVE in voter registration purposes, such as the need to ensure the eligibility of registered voters. However, the claim does not explore or provide any alternative explanations for using SAVE in this context.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations of SAVE in accurately determining citizenship status. It mentions that SAVE does not contain a database of U.S. citizens and that some voting rights groups argue that it is not a foolproof method to clean up voter rolls. However, the claim does not emphasize or elaborate on these limitations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the main functions of the SAVE database. It focuses on the use of SAVE for voter registration purposes but does not provide a complete understanding of all the functions and uses of the database.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim. The information provided by the expert's verdict is based on statements made by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner and the Department of Homeland Security.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of the claim contradicting any established facts. The information provided by the expert's verdict is consistent with the statements made by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner and the Department of Homeland Security."}
