{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size of the Trump Winery by stating that it is the \"largest winery on the East Coast\" without sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's investigation found that there was no backup or response from Trump's campaign when seeking evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the size of a winery can be determined solely by the acreage of vines planted, which the expert's investigation found to be an inadequate measure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation found that the volume of wine produced is a better measure of a winery's size, and by that standard, Trump Winery is not the largest on the East Coast."}
