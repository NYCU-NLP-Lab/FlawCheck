{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of deaths caused by lettuce compared to undocumented immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between lettuce and undocumented immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that halting food inspections over a wall is related to the number of deaths caused by lettuce and undocumented immigrants, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the number of deaths caused by lettuce and undocumented immigrants.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of undocumented immigration on violence and crime rates by not considering other studies and research that suggest a different relationship.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that studies have shown that undocumented immigration does not increase violence and that immigrants, regardless of legal status, are no more likely to commit criminal acts than native-born Americans."}
