{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo shows evangelical leaders praying over a golden statue of former President Donald Trump. The expert's verdict states that the image is altered and the original photo shows faith leaders praying with then-President Donald Trump, not the statue.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that evangelical leaders are \"literally\" praying to a golden idol, comparing it to the golden calf idol in the Bible's Old Testament.", "Understate": "There doesn't seem to be any evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an altered image as evidence of evangelical leaders praying over a golden statue of Trump.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on an altered image that does not depict the actual event it claims to show.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo at CPAC shows evangelical leaders praying over a golden statue of Trump, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict is that the original photo shows faith leaders praying with then-President Donald Trump, not the statue."}
