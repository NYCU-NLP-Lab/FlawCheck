{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's family blames him for his father's death. His brothers and sister have stated that their father died of bone cancer in 1989, not due to any actions or theft by Narendra Modi.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the alleged incidents from PM Modi's childhood, suggesting that he stole gold and caused his father's death. There is no evidence supporting these claims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the allegations made against PM Modi. The information provided is based on a social media clipping and has been shared by multiple users, but there is no credible source or evidence to back up the claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that PM Modi's alleged actions as a young boy directly caused his father's death. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption, and it is based on a speculative and unverified story.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation given by PM Modi's brothers is that their father died of bone cancer in 1989, which contradicts the claim. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim is false and lacks credibility."}
