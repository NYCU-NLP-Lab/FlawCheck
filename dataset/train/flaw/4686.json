{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the health care law by stating that it delivers a \"$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the law caps the amount that can be put into a flexible spending account at $2,500 per year, which may not necessarily result in a $13 billion tax increase on all families with special needs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion of a $13 billion tax increase on families with special needs. The expert's verdict mentions that the $13 billion estimate comes from a report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, but it does not provide further analysis or breakdown of how this estimate was calculated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care law will directly result in a tax increase on families with special needs. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the law caps the amount that can be put into a flexible spending account, which may not necessarily translate to a tax increase for all families with special needs. The assumption that the tax increase is solely due to the health care law may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the tax increase as a direct result of the health care law (\"thanks to Obamacare\"). However, the expert's verdict mentions that the tax increase is due to the cap on flexible spending accounts, which may not be solely attributed to the health care law. There could be alternative explanations for the tax increase, such as changes in tax policies unrelated to the health care law.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific facts as the expert's verdict does not provide contradictory information. However, further analysis and fact-checking would be required to determine if the claim contradicts any established facts."}
