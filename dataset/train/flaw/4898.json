{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of a government shutdown on military personnel's pay by stating that they will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not be paid until appropriations are available. The expert's verdict mentions that in previous government shutdowns, military paychecks were affected, suggesting that the claim may be downplaying the potential impact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay during a government shutdown. The expert's verdict mentions that no budget appropriations have been passed, and while the Defense Department has made plans based on past shutdown experiences, there is no concrete evidence provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay during a government shutdown, but this assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential consequences or limitations imposed by a lack of funding. The expert's verdict mentions that the military would likely be paid retroactively after a shutdown, but the claim does not address the potential challenges or delays in receiving payment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the impact of a government shutdown on military personnel's pay. The expert's verdict mentions that legislation has been introduced in the past to ensure payment for troops and civilians during a shutdown, but it did not pass. This alternative explanation is not addressed in the claim."}
