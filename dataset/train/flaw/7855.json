{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support for the mental health provisions related to mass shootings in the Senate by stating that it \"got over 90 votes.\" The expert's verdict confirms that the mental health amendment did pass by a 95-2 vote, which is even higher than the claim's statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that mental health provisions related to mass shootings received over 90 votes in the Senate. However, the expert's verdict confirms the vote count.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high number of votes for the mental health provisions in the Senate indicates strong bipartisan support. However, the expert's verdict mentions that some Republicans, including Ayotte, who co-sponsored the mental health amendment, later voted against the gun control proposal that included the provisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of votes for the mental health provisions. The expert's verdict mentions that the mental health amendment was attached to a larger gun control legislation, which ultimately did not pass. This could suggest that some Senators may have voted for the amendment as part of a compromise or to support the overall legislation, rather than solely for the mental health provisions themselves."}
