{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by stating that \"nature is back to its basics\" at Chandigarh's Kalka road during the lockdown. However, the expert's verdict reveals that the video is unrelated to the lockdown and was actually shot in Ahmedabad.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the location and context of the video. It simply states that the video was shot at Chandigarh's Kalka road during the lockdown, without providing any evidence or additional information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of birds flying in coordination is a result of the lockdown and nature returning to its basics. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the phenomenon of birds flying together in coordination, known as murmuration, is unrelated to the lockdown.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility that the birds were simply exhibiting natural behavior or that the video was taken in a different location.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was actually shot in Ahmedabad, not Chandigarh's Kalka road during the lockdown. This contradicts the claim's assertion of nature returning to its basics during the lockdown.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misattributing the location of the video to Chandigarh's Kalka road during the lockdown, when it was actually shot in Ahmedabad. This shows a lack of accuracy and reliability in the claim."}
