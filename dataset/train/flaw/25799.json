{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system, stating that it will exceed $100,000. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual average compensation is lower, around $86,297.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the latest figures available for comparison are from 2009-2010, which is two years earlier than the claim's stated year of 2011. This lack of up-to-date data weakens the support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000 in 2011. However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that the actual average compensation is lower, suggesting a problematic assumption in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations by comparing the average compensation of MPS teachers to other school districts in Milwaukee County. This comparison shows that MPS teachers' average compensation is lower than some other districts, indicating that there are alternative explanations for the claim's statement of exceeding $100,000."}
