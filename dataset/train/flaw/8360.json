{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the issue by suggesting that \"phony\" ballots were printed without the President's name on them, implying a widespread problem.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that \"phony\" ballots were printed without the President's name on them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the omission of the President's name on some ballots is intentional and part of a larger scheme, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the issue of omitted names on ballots, which is a printing error rather than intentional manipulation."}
