{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the photograph shows several large whales feeding near a tiny boat. In reality, the boat was added to the photograph later and is not an actual part of the original scene.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the photograph shows several large whales feeding near a tiny boat.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is genuine and accurately represents a real-life scenario. However, it is revealed that the image is a composite of at least two different pictures, indicating that the assumption of the photograph being authentic is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the photograph is digitally altered and not a true representation of whales feeding near a boat. This alternative explanation is provided by the expert's verdict, which states that the boat was added to the foreground later.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph is a composite of multiple images by presenting it as a single, unaltered photograph showing whales feeding near a boat.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not acknowledging or addressing the fact that the photograph is digitally altered. It presents the image as if it is a genuine depiction of whales feeding near a boat without mentioning the composite nature of the photograph."}
