{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of keeping the oil on the existence of ISIS, suggesting that if the US had kept the oil, ISIS would not exist.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the direct causation between keeping the oil and the non-existence of ISIS.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ISIS primarily funded itself through oil sales, which is a problematic assumption as other sources of funding, such as extortion and robbery, have been identified.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for ISIS's funding, such as extortion, robbery, taxes, and Syrian oil, which contradict the claim's focus solely on Iraqi oil."}
