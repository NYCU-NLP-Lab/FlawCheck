{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of bills passed by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Maxine Waters, and Sen. Bernie Sanders by stating they had only \"6 bills passed\" over \"67 combined years,\" when in fact they had sponsored and co-sponsored many more bills that became law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for its assertion that the lawmakers' effectiveness can be solely measured by the number of bills passed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of bills passed by lawmakers is the sole indicator of their effectiveness, which is a problematic assumption according to Alan Wiseman, co-director of the Center for Effective Lawmaking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim omits the context that the majority of bills introduced do not get signed into law, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for lawmakers' effectiveness beyond the number of bills passed."}
