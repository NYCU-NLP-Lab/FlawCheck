{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that there was a deliberate \"ballot dumping\" in Milwaukee at 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. on Election Day, which implies a significant and suspicious action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the delay in reporting Milwaukee ballots was due to a time-consuming process of loading absentee ballots, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion of \"ballot dumping\" and does not provide specific data or details about the process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the late reporting of heavily Democratic ballots in Milwaukee was expected and legitimate due to the city's size and the processing of absentee ballots on Election Day.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the timing of ballot reporting, such as the legal requirement in Wisconsin to begin processing absentee ballots on Election Day."}
