{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of Elizabeth Warren's pregnancy on her job loss as a speech therapist. The expert's verdict mentions that she was not asked back for the next school year and someone else was hired, but it does not explicitly state that she lost her job solely because of her pregnancy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Elizabeth Warren lost her job because she became pregnant, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that she was not asked back for the next school year, but it does not definitively confirm the reason for this decision.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully validate the assertion that Elizabeth Warren lost her job as a speech therapist because she became pregnant. The expert's verdict mentions her not being asked back for the next school year, but it does not provide additional details or evidence to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Elizabeth Warren was not asked back for the next school year as a speech therapist. The expert's verdict does not explore or provide any alternative explanations for this decision."}
