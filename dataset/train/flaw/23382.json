{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the WHO approved Coronil as a Covid-19 treatment contradicts the statement from the WHO's regional office for Southeast Asia, which stated that they had not approved the treatment.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the approval of Coronil by stating that it was approved by the WHO, when in fact it was approved by the Indian government.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on statements from the manufacturer, Patanjali, and various media outlets, but there is no direct evidence or official statement from the WHO confirming the approval.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the approval of Coronil by the Indian government is equivalent to approval by the WHO, which is a problematic assumption as the two entities are separate and have different approval processes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim was made based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the approval process, leading to the incorrect belief that the WHO had approved Coronil."}
