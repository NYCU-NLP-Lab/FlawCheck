{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the connection between Nostradamus' prediction and the CDC's advice on zombie preparedness. There is no evidence that Nostradamus specifically predicted a zombie apocalypse, and the CDC's advice may be more general in nature.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Nostradamus predicted a zombie apocalypse in 2021. The sources mentioned in the expert's verdict indicate that the prediction originates from a website that lists various predictions attributed to Nostradamus, but there is no concrete evidence to validate these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC's advice on zombie preparedness is directly related to Nostradamus' prediction. However, there is no clear connection between the two, and it is possible that the CDC's advice is more of a general preparedness guideline for potential emergencies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the CDC's advice on zombie preparedness. It is possible that the CDC's inclusion of zombie preparedness is a creative way to engage and educate the public about emergency preparedness, rather than a response to a specific prediction.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information by presenting the correlation between Nostradamus' prediction and the CDC's advice without sufficient evidence or clear causation. It may be misleading to suggest a direct connection between the two based on the available information.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
