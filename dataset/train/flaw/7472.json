{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Adam Hasner's efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as \"unequivocal proof\" that he is a moderate. The claim may be presenting these efforts as more influential or definitive than they actually are.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or examples to support the assertion that Adam Hasner cited his efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as proof of being a moderate. It only mentions two specific votes without providing a comprehensive analysis of Hasner's legislative record.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that weakening pro-life and school choice legislation is inherently indicative of being a moderate. This assumption may not hold true for all cases and can be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Adam Hasner's support for weakening pro-life and school choice legislation. It does not explore other possible motivations or reasons behind his actions."}
