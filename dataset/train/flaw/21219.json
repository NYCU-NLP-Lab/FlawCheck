{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it states that six people in Florida die every day as a result of not expanding Medicaid, which is based on the high-end estimate from a study.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is based on estimates and projections from studies, rather than concrete data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the lack of Medicaid expansion directly causes deaths in Florida, without considering other factors that may contribute to mortality rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the deaths in Florida, such as other healthcare factors or socioeconomic conditions, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on different studies with mixed results to support its argument.", "Contradict fact": "There is no explicit contradiction of fact in the claim, as it is based on estimates and projections rather than presenting false information.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information."}
