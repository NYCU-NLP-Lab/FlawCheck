{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Russ Feingold \"has not worked anywhere outside of politics.\" This is not entirely true, as Feingold had worked as an attorney before entering politics.", "Understate": "The claim understates Feingold's previous work experience by ignoring his time as an attorney.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Feingold has never worked outside of politics. The evidence provided only shows his time as an attorney, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he worked on political items at the law firms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that working in politics is the only valid form of work experience and dismisses Feingold's time as an attorney.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Feingold did have work experience outside of politics, as an attorney, but the claim ignores this."}
