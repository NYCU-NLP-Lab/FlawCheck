{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it suggests that the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions, which is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided by the Walker spokeswoman refers to a report on WISN TV and a story on Politico, but these sources do not explicitly state that the board wanted to consider these names as valid signatures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the board would automatically accept these names without challenge, which is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be an alternative explanation for the board's statement about flagging the names of Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler. The statement suggests that they would be flagged for more review, indicating that they would not automatically be accepted as valid signatures.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the board's actions and intentions. The board did not decide to \"accept\" the fictitious signatures, as claimed in the MacIver video.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the board did not automatically consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures, as they would be flagged for more review.", "Biases not identified": "None."}
