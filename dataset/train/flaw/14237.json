{"Contradict fact": "The claim attributes a quote to William Shakespeare, but experts from the Folger Shakespeare Library and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust have stated that the quote is not from Shakespeare.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the attribution of the quote to Shakespeare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quote is from Shakespeare based on its content and popularity on social media, but experts have debunked this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The last part of the quote is actually from a poem by William Arthur Ward, suggesting that the quote may have been a combination or misattribution of different sources."}
