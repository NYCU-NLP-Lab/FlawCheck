{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the poorest 10% of households gained around 13% in their incomes due to tax and benefit changes under Labour, while the richest lost almost 9%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tax and benefit changes under Labour were solely responsible for the income changes observed, without considering other potential factors that could have influenced household incomes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) that income inequality changed little under Labour, suggesting that the claim may not accurately represent the overall income inequality situation.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact of tax and benefit changes on the income distribution, as it only focuses on the poorest 10% and the richest without providing information about the middle-income groups.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the income changes by presenting them as significant percentages without providing context or comparing them to other periods or policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the observed income changes, such as economic trends, global factors, or other government policies that could have influenced household incomes."}
