{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Kavanaugh's statement by suggesting that he said the president \"shouldn't be investigated,\" when in fact he was discussing the possibility of exempting the president from criminal prosecution while in office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully substantiate the assertion that Kavanaugh believes the president shouldn't be investigated. The provided information only mentions Kavanaugh's discussion of exempting the president from criminal prosecution.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kavanaugh's statement about exempting the president from criminal prosecution translates to a belief that the president shouldn't be investigated. This assumption may oversimplify Kavanaugh's position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Kavanaugh's statement, such as suggesting that exempting the president from criminal prosecution could be a way to protect the executive branch from politicized investigations, rather than a belief that the president shouldn't be investigated at all."}
