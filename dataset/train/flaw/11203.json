{"Exaggerate": "The claim of there being \"30 million, it could be 34 million\" illegal immigrants in the United States is an exaggeration, as it goes against the estimates provided by credible sources such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and independent organizations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is not backed by any credible, research-based estimates. The expert states that there are no credible estimates of 30 million illegal immigrants and that the range of 11-12 million is broadly accepted by researchers and immigration advocates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government has no idea about the number of illegal immigrants, which is a problematic assumption. While estimating the exact number may be challenging, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other organizations use various methods to arrive at their estimates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the most recent estimate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as well as other independent organizations, puts the number of illegal immigrants at around 11-12 million, not 30-34 million.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of illegal immigrants by suggesting that the actual number could be much higher than the estimates provided by credible sources. However, the available evidence suggests that the number is closer to 11-12 million.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that there might be an alternative explanation for the number of illegal immigrants, implying that the estimates provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other organizations may not be accurate. However, the expert's verdict and the available evidence do not support this alternative explanation."}
