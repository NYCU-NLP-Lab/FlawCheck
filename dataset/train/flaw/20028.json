{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in household income under Mitt Romney as governor of Massachusetts. The expert's verdict states that the increase was not adjusted for inflation and was actually a drop of $589, about 1 percent.", "Understate": "The claim understates the decrease in household income in America over the last four years. The expert's verdict mentions that the decrease was $4,600 or 8.3 percent, based on a study by Sentier Research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's governorship in Massachusetts directly led to an increase in household income, without considering other factors that may have influenced the economy during that time.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the specific figures mentioned. The expert's verdict mentions that the dollar figure of the increase in household income under Romney was accurate but not adjusted for inflation, and that governors have only marginal impact on their states' economies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the changes in household income, such as broader economic trends or policies implemented by the federal government."}
