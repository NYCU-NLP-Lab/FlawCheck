{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that corporate tax revenues are \"still rising\" despite a 40 percent drop in the tax rate. The expert's verdict states that corporate tax receipts have actually declined by 22.3 percent in the first six months of fiscal year 2018.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the tax rate drop on corporate tax revenues. The expert's verdict mentions that revenues are projected to be less over the next 10 years because of the new tax law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that corporate tax revenues are still rising. The expert's verdict provides evidence of a decline in corporate tax receipts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drop in the tax rate would not significantly affect corporate tax revenues. The expert's verdict contradicts this assumption by pointing out the decline in tax receipts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the rise in corporate tax revenues, such as economic growth or other factors not related to the tax rate drop. The expert's verdict provides a more comprehensive analysis by mentioning the impact of mandatory spending on rising deficits."}
