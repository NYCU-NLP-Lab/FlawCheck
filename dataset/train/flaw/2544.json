{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a dead woman being brought back to life after three years in the grave can be seen as an exaggerated statement, as there is no concrete evidence or scientific proof to support such a miraculous event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence, as the only sources mentioned are an article from Women's News and an Indonesian blog. Both of these sources may not be reliable or credible enough to validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported event of a dead woman coming back to life is true without questioning the credibility or potential alternative explanations for the phenomenon.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reported event, such as misinterpretation, hoax, or cultural practices that may give the illusion of a dead person coming back to life.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of consistency, as it mentions an older version of the story posted on an Indonesian blog in 2009, indicating that the claim has been circulating for years without any substantial evidence or widespread recognition.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts established scientific facts and medical understanding of death and the impossibility of bringing a person back to life after such a long period of time.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
