{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the issue of counterfeit Pakistani 500 rupee notes by implying that all notes without the flag are fake, while the expert's verdict states that both versions of the note, with or without the flag, are genuine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of the Pakistani flag on a 500 rupee note indicates that it is counterfeit. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the flag is not a necessary feature for authenticity, as both versions of the note are genuine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a video shared on Facebook, which does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove the authenticity or counterfeiting of the 500 rupee notes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the absence or presence of the flag on the 500 rupee notes is not a determining factor for their authenticity."}
