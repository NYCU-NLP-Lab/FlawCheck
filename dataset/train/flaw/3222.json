{"Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that tracing the origins of the quote was difficult and that primary iterations of it have been deleted from the web. The earliest versions of the quote found were from 2008-2009, primarily on blogs and forums. This lack of concrete evidence and the deleted sources suggest a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert notes that the quote attributed to Margaret Sanger has been creatively interpreted and paraphrased. The original source of the quote is unclear, and the expert mentions that the closest quotation found from Sanger in a New York Times article did not attach the term \"weeds\" to any particular race or ethnicity. This suggests a problematic assumption in the claim that Sanger specifically made the statement about Slavs, Latin, and Hebrew immigrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the quote attributed to Sanger has been fraught with suspicion and accusation due to her advocacy of birth control and selective family planning. The controversy surrounding Sanger's views and the timing of the quote's popularity during the Planned Parenthood controversy in 2015 suggest that there may be alternative explanations for the attribution of the quote to Sanger.", "Contradict fact": "The expert states that the closest quotation found from Sanger in a New York Times article did not attach the term \"weeds\" to any particular race or ethnicity. This contradicts the claim that Sanger specifically said \"Slavs, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds.\"", "Exaggerate": "The expert mentions that the quote attributed to Sanger has been creatively interpreted and paraphrased. The claim presents the quote as a direct statement made by Sanger, but the expert's analysis suggests that the quote may have been exaggerated or distorted in its attribution to Sanger."}
