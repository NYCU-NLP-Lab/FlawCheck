{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of the elderly man in the incident, presenting him as a heroic figure trying to protect someone, while the expert's verdict states that he was actively engaged in the fight and carrying a baton.", "Understate": "The claim understates the context of the incident by not mentioning the presence of far-right groups and counter-protesters, which led to the street brawl.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that the elderly man was beaten solely for trying to protect a sundress-wearing man. The expert's verdict provides video evidence showing the elderly man's active involvement in the fight.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the elderly man was a victim of an unprovoked attack, without considering the possibility that he was involved in the altercation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a single narrative of the incident, ignoring alternative explanations and perspectives provided by the expert's verdict."}
