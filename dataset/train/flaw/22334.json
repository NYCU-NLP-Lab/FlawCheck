{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of manufacturing jobs lost under Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts. While the claim states that 40,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, the expert's verdict reveals that the actual number is close but not exactly 40,000.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the job creation ranking of Massachusetts under Mitt Romney's governorship. The claim states that Massachusetts fell to 47th in job creation, but the expert's verdict mentions that the state ranked 47th out of 50 states, not including the District of Columbia.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing accurate and precise numbers. While the overall message of job loss and low job creation is conveyed, the specific numbers mentioned in the claim are not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully back up its assertions. The expert's verdict provides additional context and data to support and clarify the claim, but the claim itself does not provide sufficient evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job losses and low job creation in Massachusetts during Mitt Romney's governorship were solely his responsibility. The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in manufacturing jobs under Romney was slower than in previous or successive four-year periods, suggesting that there may be alternative factors at play.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in manufacturing jobs and job creation in Massachusetts may not solely be attributed to Mitt Romney's actions as governor. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the observed trends."}
