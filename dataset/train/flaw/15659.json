{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the Fast and Furious gun-walking program started in the Bush administration contradicts the fact that it actually started in October 2009, during Obama's first term.", "Understate": "The claim understates the extent of the flaws and problems with the Fast and Furious program, as investigations found many flaws and it ultimately resulted in the death of a Border Patrol agent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed up by evidence or specific examples.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not dropping Fast and Furious was a mistake without providing sufficient reasoning or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that while Fast and Furious did not start in the Bush administration, the idea of gun-walking in general does trace back to the previous administration's Operation Wide Receiver."}
