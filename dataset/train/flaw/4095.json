{"Exaggerate": "The claim of survival rates over 99.9% may be an exaggeration as it fails to consider factors such as age, pre-existing conditions, and demographics that affect survival rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the stated survival rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that survival rates can be accurately determined and generalized without considering the specific circumstances and demographics of each country.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the claim of high survival rates can be misleading and that there are alternative explanations for the data, such as asymptomatic cases and differing case fatality rates.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim by highlighting the limitations and inaccuracies in quoting survival rates without considering relevant factors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual case fatality rates by presenting survival rates that are higher than what is supported by available data and expert opinions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the complexities and variations in survival rates based on age, sex, and pre-existing conditions."}
