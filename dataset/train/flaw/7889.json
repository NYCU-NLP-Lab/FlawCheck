This assumption ignores the fact that Jamaicans can have African ancestry.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the people in the photo are not Kamala Harris's parents, as confirmed by the individuals themselves.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the photo was taken at a gala where Harris was a guest of honor, and the individuals in the photo are board members of the organization hosting the gala."}
