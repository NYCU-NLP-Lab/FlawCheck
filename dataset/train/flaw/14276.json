{"Exaggerate": "Pelosi greatly exaggerated the percentage of Americans with employer-based coverage when she argued that repealing the law would hurt all Americans. The actual percentage is much lower than the claimed 75 percent.", "Lack enough support": "Pelosi's claim of 75 percent of Americans getting their health benefits through their workplace does not have enough supporting evidence. The figures provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Census Bureau contradict this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "Pelosi's claim assumes that all Americans who get their health benefits through their workplace would be negatively affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. This assumption may not hold true for everyone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the discrepancy between Pelosi's claim and the actual percentage of Americans with employer-based coverage. It is possible that Pelosi's staff analysis of the Census Bureau's report for 2014 was flawed or there may be other factors influencing the numbers."}
