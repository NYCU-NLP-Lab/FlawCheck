{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Democrats by stating that they \"killed\" a bill for tuition assistance for children of veterans killed in battle.

The expert's verdict provides detailed information and sources to support their analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by suggesting that Democrats prioritize subsidizing the education and healthcare of illegal immigrants over tuition assistance for children of veterans killed in battle. The expert's verdict clarifies that certain education and Medicaid benefits are available to immigrants living in the country illegally in some states, but this does not necessarily mean that Democrats prioritize this over other issues.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanations in the provided claim."}
