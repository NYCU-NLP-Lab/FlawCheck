{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin. While there were increases in unemployment in many counties and municipalities, the statewide unemployment rate actually dropped in June.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the declining statewide unemployment rate and the largest month-to-month private-sector job gain since 2003.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rise in unemployment, such as factors unrelated to immigration or Paul Ryan's advocacy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to fully support the assertion that unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin solely due to Paul Ryan's advocacy of immigration increases.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the statewide unemployment rate actually dropped in June, which challenges the notion of a continuous rise in unemployment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Paul Ryan's advocacy of immigration increases and the rise in unemployment, without considering other potential factors or complexities at play.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and comprehensive analysis of the relationship between immigration increases and unemployment in Wisconsin."}
