{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Hobby Lobby's health care plan does provide coverage for 16 out of the 20 FDA-approved forms of contraception.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the salesclerk at Hobby Lobby will not have access to contraception through her employer's health care plan, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the salesclerk will not be able to access contraception through her employer's health care plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as Hobby Lobby's website states that they do provide coverage for the other 16 forms of contraception."}
