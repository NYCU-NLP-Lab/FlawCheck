{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because there are no confirmed sources or individuals who have come forward to verify the incident of a baby being thrown and caught from Grenfell Tower.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a baby was thrown from Grenfell Tower and caught by an unidentified man, without concrete evidence or multiple sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the accounts of witnesses may be inaccurate or exaggerated, as there is no corroborating evidence or additional witnesses to confirm the incident.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the difficulty and rarity of catching a baby thrown from a significant height, as it acknowledges that it would be a remarkable feat but does not emphasize the extreme challenge and risk involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies solely on witness accounts without any additional evidence or confirmation, making it less reliable and subject to potential inaccuracies or inconsistencies."}
