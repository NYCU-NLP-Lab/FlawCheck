{"Understate": "The claim suggests that no arrests were made for the individuals responsible for the 2008 economic crisis. This could be an understatement as it implies that no action was taken against anyone involved in the crisis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that no arrests were made. It lacks sufficient support to substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that individuals from Wall Street, corporate America, and bankers were solely responsible for bringing down the economy in 2008. This assumption overlooks other factors and actors that may have contributed to the crisis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that arrests may have been made but were not widely reported or publicized. It assumes that no arrests occurred without considering alternative explanations."}
