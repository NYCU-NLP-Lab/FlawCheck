{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is \"going to a mental hospital\" after what she did overnight, desperate to escape arrest. There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that Wasserman Schultz is going to a mental hospital or that she did something overnight to escape arrest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Wasserman Schultz's actions were motivated by a desire to escape arrest, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to support the assertion that Wasserman Schultz is going to a mental hospital or that she did something overnight to escape arrest.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of evidence and support for the assertion made about Wasserman Schultz's mental health and actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for Wasserman Schultz's actions or behavior, but instead jumps to the conclusion that she is going to a mental hospital to escape arrest."}
