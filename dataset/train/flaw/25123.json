{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the connection between the release of the Access Hollywood tape and the start of WikiLeaks dropping Podesta's emails by stating that they happened within one hour of each other.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal link between the two events.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the timing of the two events is not coincidental, suggesting a deliberate connection between them, but it does not provide any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the timing of the events, such as the actions of different individuals or organizations unrelated to each other.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a clear and convincing argument for the suggested connection between the Access Hollywood tape and the release of Podesta's emails.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim, as it is more about the lack of evidence and support rather than directly contradicting established facts.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay the significance of the events mentioned."}
