{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in the sense that it presents the use of frozen pants as a widespread phenomenon for calling \"dibs\" on parking spots, when in reality it seems to be more of a joke or a creative way to gain attention on social media.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to suggest that freezing pants is a common or effective method for claiming parking spots. The evidence provided only mentions one person, Adam Selzer, who used this method as a joke.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that freezing pants is a legitimate way to reserve parking spots, without providing any evidence or explanation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations for the use of frozen pants, such as a creative art project or a humorous social media trend, rather than a serious attempt to claim parking spots."}
