{"Lack enough support": "The claim that farmers want article 370 and 35A to be restored in Kashmir is not supported by any specific evidence or data. The provided information only includes social media posts and an image of Sikh men protesting against the abrogation of these articles, but it does not provide any concrete evidence that represents the viewpoint of all farmers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all farmers share the same opinion and desire the restoration of article 370 and 35A in Kashmir. However, there is no evidence or data presented to support this assumption. It is possible that different farmers may have different views on this issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the image of Sikh men protesting against the abrogation of articles 370 and 35A. It is mentioned that the image was posted by a splinter group of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) which has advocated for the formation of a separate Sikh state of Khalistan. This alternative explanation suggests that the protest may be driven by a specific political or separatist agenda rather than representing the viewpoint of all farmers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which farmers want article 370 and 35A to be restored in Kashmir. The claim does not provide any evidence of widespread support or a representative sample of farmers expressing this desire. It is based on a few social media posts and an image that may not be representative of the entire farming community.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and well-supported argument. The information provided includes various social media posts, tweets, and an image, but it lacks a comprehensive analysis or reliable sources to substantiate the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the provided claim."}
