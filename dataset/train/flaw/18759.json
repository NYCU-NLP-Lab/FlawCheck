{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the President provided little backup for his claim, and local officials had trouble tracking down the information he was referring to.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Madison and Milwaukee County carry \"sanctuary status\" for illegal immigrants, but the expert's verdict states that the cities do not identify themselves as such.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, as it only mentions sexual assault of a child but does not provide further details or statistics.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of sanctuary policies by suggesting that released undocumented immigrants are actively searching for new victims.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Madison and Milwaukee County do not officially identify as sanctuary cities, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while the cities may not have sanctuary status, they do practice immigration protection in a way that may fit the meaning of sanctuary.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that undocumented immigrants who committed multiple crimes, including sexual assault of a child, were released in Madison and Milwaukee County."}
