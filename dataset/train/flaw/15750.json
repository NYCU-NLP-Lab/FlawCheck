This suggests that the video is not directly related to the election activities mentioned in the article.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the connection between violence and the collection of data on mentally-ill people during the Indonesian elections. Without sufficient evidence, it is not accurate to make such a strong claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as it being unrelated to the election activities or the context in which the incident occurred."}
