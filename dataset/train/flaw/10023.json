{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single study that only includes former NFL players from 1959 to 1988. The study does not account for modern-day players or the changing physique of today's football player.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lower mortality rates and lower rates of heart disease and cancer among former NFL players can be solely attributed to their profession as professional athletes and access to quality healthcare.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lower mortality rates and lower rates of heart disease and cancer among former NFL players, such as lifestyle factors or other individual differences.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks and long-term health effects associated with playing in the NFL, as it focuses only on mortality rates and rates of heart disease and cancer.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough context or explanation for the statement made by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell."}
