{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Gov. Scott Walker is openly backing a move to abolish the state retirement system and convert it to a 401(k)-style plan. The claim states that Walker is openly talking about it, but it is not being publicized, which creates a contradiction and suggests an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that Gov. Scott Walker is actively backing the move to abolish the state retirement system and reduce pensions by at least a third. It relies on a chain email and mentions concerns raised by various groups, but does not provide concrete evidence or official statements from Gov. Walker.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the concerns raised by public employees and Democrats. It assumes that Gov. Walker is planning to strip away guaranteed pension benefits without exploring other possible motives or actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the move to convert the retirement system to a 401(k)-style plan will reduce pensions by at least a third for current and retired public employees. This assumption is not supported by evidence or a clear explanation of how the conversion would impact pensions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of its coherence and clarity. It mentions a contradiction in the chain email, stating that Walker is openly talking about the move but it is not being publicized. This inconsistency weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting factual information in the provided claim."}
