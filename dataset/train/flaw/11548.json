{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the similarities between the health care systems in Canada and Great Britain and the health care law in the United States. It implies that the rationing of care seen in Canada and Great Britain will happen under the current health care law, which is an exaggeration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the health care law will result in rationing of care, without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the assertion that the health care law rations care like the systems in Canada and Great Britain.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that people in the United Kingdom and Canada do receive care, although there may be wait times for appointments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the differences in health care systems between the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, such as the different models of government involvement in health care."}
