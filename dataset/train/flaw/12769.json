{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the Israeli policeman strangled a Palestinian child to death, without providing sufficient evidence to support this extreme claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a video and some tweets as evidence, without any additional corroborating sources or information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident shown in the video is related to the demonstration of the US embassy in Jerusalem, without providing any concrete evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility that it may not involve an Israeli policeman and a Palestinian child, but rather a different incident in a different location, as suggested by the expert's investigation."}
