{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a letter circulating on social media without any official confirmation or endorsement from the Crime Prevention Council of India or any other government authority.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the letter circulating on social media is a government order, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the letter, such as it being a hoax or misinformation spread by individuals or groups with a specific agenda.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential consequences of sharing political propaganda posts on social media before the elections. It only mentions the warning of action by the district-level special surveillance team of the Election Commission, but there may be other legal or social implications as well.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Crime Prevention Council of India is not affiliated with the government, as evidenced by the website URL not ending with 'gov.in' or 'nic.in'. This contradicts the assumption that the letter is a government order.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
