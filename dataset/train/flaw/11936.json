{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks any details or citations as to when or where the statement was made, and a search of news archives turns up no trace of it. The quote cannot be found in any interviews or books and only appears to exist in the form of memes and social media posts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quote attributed to President Trump's mother is legitimate without providing any credible evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no credible evidence to suggest that the quote is real.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the lack of evidence and support for the quote, as it presents the quote as if it were a factual statement made by President Trump's mother.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the quote may be a fabrication or a misattribution, as it cannot be found in any credible sources or news archives."}
