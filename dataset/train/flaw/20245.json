{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by Rahul Gandhi by presenting it as if he said he will leave India and settle in London, without providing the full context of his statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a short 11-second clip without the full context of Rahul Gandhi's speech.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rahul Gandhi's statement is a genuine intention to leave India and settle in London, without considering the possibility that he may have been making a rhetorical statement or referring to something else.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rahul Gandhi's statement was taken out of context and was actually referring to fugitive businessmen Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Rahul Gandhi's statement was not about leaving India permanently, but rather a rhetorical statement or a metaphorical expression."}
