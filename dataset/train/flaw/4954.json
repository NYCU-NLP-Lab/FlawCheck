{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Eric Clapton actually made the statement about Prince being the greatest guitar player in the world, which is highly unlikely and follows a false urban legend narrative.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Eric Clapton made the statement attributed to him.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Prince was not necessarily seen as being in the top echelon of world-class guitarists by his fellow musicians.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Prince's guitar playing abilities by attributing the title of the greatest guitar player in the world to him.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests an alternative explanation for the statement, citing a decades-old false urban legend involving Jimi Hendrix or Clapton himself answering a similar question about Phil Keaggy.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the context and origin of the purported quote, as it is based on a false urban legend.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the provided claim."}
