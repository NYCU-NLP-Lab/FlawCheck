{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the Affordable Care Act by stating that it is a \"major reason\" for the reduction in preventable patient deaths without providing sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only references a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality without providing further evidence or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in preventable patient deaths is solely attributable to the Affordable Care Act, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the improvement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the reduction in preventable patient deaths, such as improved data collection and efforts by hospitals through programs like Partnership for Patients, as mentioned by Lucian Leape."}
