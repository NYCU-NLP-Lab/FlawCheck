{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that both witnesses \"stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, & were unable to answer the question.\" This is not an accurate representation of what actually happened during the hearing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the witnesses did respond to the question asked by Rep. Ratcliffe. Although their responses were interrupted, they did attempt to answer before being cut off.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details to back up the assertion made about the witnesses' reactions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the witnesses' reactions, as described, indicate their inability to answer the question. However, it is possible that their responses were interrupted or that they had a different reason for pausing before answering.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the witnesses' responses were cut off or that they were not given a chance to fully answer the question."}
