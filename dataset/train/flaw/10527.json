{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Delhi's Muslim community celebrated PM Modi's birthday at Nizamuddin Markaz. The only evidence provided is a video of a group of Muslim men celebrating outside the Markaz, but it does not confirm that they were celebrating Modi's birthday.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because the evidence provided is based on a video that does not explicitly mention the purpose of the celebration or provide any context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the celebration outside Nizamuddin Markaz was specifically for PM Modi's birthday, but this assumption is not backed by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the celebration outside Nizamuddin Markaz, such as a general gathering or event unrelated to PM Modi's birthday. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
