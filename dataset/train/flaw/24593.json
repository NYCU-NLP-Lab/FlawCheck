{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Confederate flags appeared at the gun-rights rally in Richmond, Virginia, without providing sufficient evidence or proof.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or documentation to verify the presence of Confederate flags at the rally.", "Contradict fact": "Some right-leaning observers vehemently rejected the claim and provided photographs that allegedly disproved the presence of Confederate flags at the rally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The presence or absence of Confederate flags at the rally could have alternative explanations or interpretations, which are not explored or considered in the claim."}
