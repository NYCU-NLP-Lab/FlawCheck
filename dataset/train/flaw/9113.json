{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Joe Biden said, \"I don't know what I'm signing,\" while signing a document. The video clip and enhanced audio do not clearly capture Biden's words.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden's muttering indicates a lack of knowledge about what he is signing, which is a subjective interpretation and not supported by concrete evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the uncertainty surrounding Biden's words during the signing ceremony, as experts and enhanced audio analysis could not definitively determine what he said.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a short video clip and ambiguous audio to make a conclusive statement about Biden's statement while signing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Biden's muttering, such as difficulty hearing or speaking clearly due to wearing a mask or being in a public setting."}
