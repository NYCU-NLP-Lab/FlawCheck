{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the purging of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood by the Obama administration. The expert's verdict states that less than 1 percent of 160,000 pages of training documents were rescinded, but it does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the extent of the purging.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the claim that the Obama administration purged training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood. The expert's verdict mentions that the FBI did rescind some training material, but it was due to factual inaccuracies, imprecision, or stereotypes, rather than a deliberate purge of information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purging of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood by the Obama administration was unjustified or politically motivated. The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence to support or refute this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the rescinding of training material about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood. The expert's verdict mentions that the material contained factual inaccuracies, imprecision, or stereotypes, which could be a valid reason for its removal.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the purging of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood by the Obama administration was a deliberate action. The expert's verdict mentions that the FBI rescinded training material, but it does not provide evidence of a deliberate purge.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the purging of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood by the Obama administration. The expert's verdict states that less than 1 percent of training documents were rescinded, suggesting that the purge may not have been as extensive as claimed.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that the Obama administration purged training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood. The expert's verdict mentions some instances of rescinded material but does not provide a comprehensive analysis."}
