{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Judy Mikovits was jailed in 2021 for discovering retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines, when there are no credible reports of her being detained in 2021.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no reliable academic publications indicating that Mikovits made the specific discovery mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Mikovits was jailed solely for her alleged discovery of retroviruses being transmitted through vaccines, when in fact she was arrested on charges of theft from a laboratory.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mikovits' study on retroviruses did not establish a causal link between the retrovirus XMRV and chronic fatigue.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by falsely stating that Mikovits' arrest was related to her research on retroviruses, when it was actually related to theft charges.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Mikovits' arrest and instead presents a misleading narrative about her alleged discovery and subsequent imprisonment."}
