{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the new GOP Wisconsin Assembly members' vote on taking funding away from public schools and giving it to private Milwaukee voucher schools. The expert's verdict explains that while the budget did cut aid to public schools, it also allocated funds to expand the school choice program, which sends lower-income Milwaukee children to private schools.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that GOP Wisconsin Assembly members voted to take funding away from public schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding taken away from public schools was solely given to private Milwaukee voucher schools, without considering other potential uses for the funds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the budget cuts and the expansion of the school choice program, such as the need for fiscal responsibility or the desire to provide more educational options for lower-income students."}
