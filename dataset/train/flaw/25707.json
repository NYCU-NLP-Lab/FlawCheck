{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the university will give black students free tuition as an apology for slavery. The resolution passed by the Student Government Association only recommended that the university considers making tuition 'free' for all black students, but it has not been implemented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific details about the university's plans to give free tuition to black students. The resolution passed by the Student Government Association is not binding and has not been implemented.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the resolution passed by the Student Government Association is a definitive decision by the university to give free tuition to black students. However, the resolution is just a recommendation and does not guarantee any action by the university.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the university's actions or lack thereof. It does not explore other possible reasons for the resolution or the university's response to it."}
