{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the revelation of Michael Brown's alleged involvement in a robbery on MSNBC. It suggests that MSNBC practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings, which may be an exaggeration of the actual response.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about MSNBC's response to the revelation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that MSNBC's response to the revelation of Michael Brown's alleged involvement in a robbery was significant and required behind-closed-doors meetings, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation presented in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that MSNBC was the first of the three cable networks to air surveillance video of the alleged robbery in Ferguson, which suggests that they did not go off the air for a while as stated in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
