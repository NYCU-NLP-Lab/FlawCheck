{"Understate": "The claim states that food assistance is ending for \"nearly 700,000 people,\" while the expert's verdict clarifies that the change in work requirements will cut off 688,000 people from the program.

It lacks enough support to fully validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decision to change work requirements for food assistance will directly result in ending assistance for nearly 700,000 people. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that it is an estimate projected by the USDA, and the number initially estimated was 750,000. The claim may make a problematic assumption by presenting the estimated number as a definitive outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives for the change in work requirements and the potential impact on food assistance recipients.
