{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which wind turbines built in China were purchased with the stimulus funds. While it is stated that 80% of the $2 billion spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China, it is unclear if this percentage is accurate or if there were other factors involved in the allocation of funds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that 80% of the funds were used to purchase wind turbines built in China. It only refers to an op-ed in Investor's Business Daily and a report from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, both of which are not directly cited.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the goal of the stimulus bill was to provide \"green jobs\" for Americans and that purchasing wind turbines built in China goes against this goal. However, the stimulus bill had various objectives, and it is not clear if the funds allocated for wind turbines were intended solely for creating jobs or if other factors, such as cost-effectiveness or availability, were considered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why wind turbines built in China were purchased with the stimulus funds. It is possible that there were limited options or contractual agreements in place that led to this decision, rather than a deliberate choice to prioritize foreign manufacturers over American ones."}
