{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the lack of congressional oversight over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). While the CFPB does have some degree of independence from congressional oversight, it is not completely devoid of oversight mechanisms.", "Understate": "The claim understates the bipartisan support that Richard Cordray received during his confirmation as the head of the CFPB in 2013.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to fully substantiate the assertion that the CFPB has \"no congressional oversight.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of congressional oversight is inherently problematic without considering potential benefits or alternative forms of oversight.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or acknowledge potential alternative explanations for the level of oversight and independence afforded to the CFPB."}
