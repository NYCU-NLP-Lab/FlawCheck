{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the quantity of coffins ordered by stating that the Obama administration ordered $1 billion worth of \"disposable coffins,\" when in reality, the objects shown in the photos are burial vaults or grave liners.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Obama administration ordered these coffins. The provided evidence explains that the objects shown in the photos have been around since before Obama's presidency and have nothing to do with FEMA or any other government agency.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the coffins are intended for use in \"FEMA camps\" and that they are part of a plan to suppress an American revolt. However, there is no evidence or logical reasoning provided to support these assumptions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the objects shown in the photos are burial vaults or grave liners, not \"disposable coffins.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence to debunk the claim and clarify the nature of these objects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the purpose of the burial vaults or grave liners, stating that they are used in areas where water seepage or ground subsidence is an issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an outdated conspiracy rumor and misrepresenting the nature of the objects shown in the photos. It fails to provide accurate and up-to-date information.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim."}
