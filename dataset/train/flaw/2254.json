{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that the proposed law would allow a child to be aborted right up to the moment of birth, which may not accurately reflect the provisions of the law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that the proposed law allows abortions up to the moment of birth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed law would lead to the killing of babies, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not consider the various factors and circumstances surrounding late-term abortions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the proposed law that do not align with the claim's assertion of allowing abortions up to the moment of birth."}
