{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of prisoners of war that Edith Piaf helped escape by stating that she helped 120 prisoners escape, while other sources suggest she saved \"thousands\" or that the prisoners themselves made their own fake IDs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the claim that Edith Piaf helped prisoners escape by fabricating phoney identity cards.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Edith Piaf's actions were solely responsible for the escape of the prisoners, without considering other possible factors or individuals involved in the escape.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations, such as the possibility that the prisoners themselves made their own fake IDs, as suggested by some sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no record of Edith Piaf taking photographs with prisoners as souvenirs of her visit, as documented by Carolyn Burke's biography.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the extent of Edith Piaf's involvement in helping prisoners escape, as other sources suggest she played a larger role in saving Jews from Nazi camps.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a modified and embellished version of an old tale, as stated by the expert's verdict."}
