{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the length of time that state employees have gone without a raise. The expert's verdict mentions that state employees have already been asked to sacrifice, suggesting that the lack of a raise may have been ongoing for longer than five or six years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that state employees haven't received a raise in five or six years. The expert's verdict mentions that the state worker who made the claim was not identified in news stories, indicating a lack of concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that state employees should have received a raise in the past five or six years, without providing any context or justification for this expectation. The expert's verdict mentions that state workers have already been asked to sacrifice, suggesting that there may be reasons why raises have not been given.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that state employees have been asked to redirect 5 percent of their salary to retirement benefits and accept cuts to their health care benefits. These actions could be seen as alternative explanations for the lack of a raise, as the state government may have prioritized other areas of employee compensation.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Florida Gov. Rick Scott did not directly answer the state worker's question about raises, instead offering a quick lesson in capitalism. This suggests that the claim may falter in terms of receiving a direct and satisfactory response from the governor.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
