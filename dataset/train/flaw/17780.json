{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the difference in legal protection between a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man and an eight-year-old child.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hate crimes laws put citizens in different classes and protect some more than others, which can be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may influence the level of legal protection for different victims of attacks.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that hate crimes laws aim to provide additional legal protections to victims attacked because of their sexual orientation or gender."}
