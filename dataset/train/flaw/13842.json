{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of credit downgrades in New Jersey since Chris Christie became governor by stating there have been \"seven credit downgrades\" when in reality there have been eight adjustments downward by the three major ratings agencies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to back up the statement about credit downgrades in New Jersey. It does not provide specific details or sources for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the number of credit downgrades and by not fully explaining the context and reasons behind the downgrades.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that credit downgrades reflect solely on a governor's performance as a state CEO, without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the downgrades.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the credit downgrades, such as long-running problems with the state's pension and health care obligations or a slow economic recovery, as mentioned by Standard & Poor's in their announcement of the first credit-rating downgrade."}
