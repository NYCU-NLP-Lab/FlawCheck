{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there is one charter school that has been rated unacceptable for seven years lacks support as the troubled school was already out of business when the statement was made.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state can shut down a regular poor-performing school in as little as three years, and charter schools can be shut down even more quickly.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters as it does not take into account the greater leeway enjoyed by charter schools under state law compared to traditional public schools.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing a charter school to continue being rated unacceptable for seven years is a valid reason to crack down on all charter schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the poor performance of charter schools, such as the struggle to revoke their licenses and the disproportionate number of low-performing charter schools compared to traditional public schools."}
