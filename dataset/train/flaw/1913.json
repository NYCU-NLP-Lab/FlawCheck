{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides anecdotal evidence of at least four buyers on eBay paying thousands of dollars for empty PlayStation 5 boxes. There is no further evidence or data provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high bids for empty PlayStation 5 boxes indicate a widespread phenomenon or trend. However, the provided evidence only mentions a few instances of such bids, and it does not establish that this is a common occurrence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that some bidders mistakenly bid on the listings without carefully reading the item description, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. This suggests that the high bids may not necessarily reflect the actual value placed on empty PlayStation 5 boxes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the high bids by stating that buyers paid \"thousands of dollars\" for empty PlayStation 5 boxes. While it is true that some bids reached high amounts, it is unclear how many buyers actually paid those amounts or if the transactions were completed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that the transactions for the four listings were never completed, as confirmed by eBay. This information undermines the claim that buyers actually paid thousands of dollars for empty PlayStation 5 boxes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the transactions were never completed for the four listings, as confirmed by eBay. This contradicts the claim that buyers paid thousands of dollars for empty PlayStation 5 boxes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the situation or addressing potential counterarguments. It focuses on a few instances of high bids without considering other factors or explanations."}
