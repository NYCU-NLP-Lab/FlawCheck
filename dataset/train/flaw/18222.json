{"Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of services provided by Planned Parenthood that are mammograms and preventative health care. The expert's verdict states that \"97 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are other forms of reproductive and primary care,\" which suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the full extent of mammograms and preventative health care provided by Planned Parenthood.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence to fully substantiate the percentage of services provided by Planned Parenthood that are mammograms and preventative health care. The expert's verdict mentions a Planned Parenthood press release with a similar statistic, but not an identical one. This lack of specific and comprehensive evidence may weaken the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the services provided by Planned Parenthood. While it emphasizes mammograms and preventative health care, it does not address other services such as abortion procedures, which account for 3 percent of all services provided. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim may not provide a complete picture of Planned Parenthood's services."}
