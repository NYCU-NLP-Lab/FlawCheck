{"Lack enough support": "The claim of roughly 500,000 Georgians obtaining a Georgia weapons carry license is based on reported numbers from probate judges, which may not be consistently or accurately reported. The information has its shortcomings and some probate judges fail to report the number of applicants consistently or at all.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all Georgians who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia weapons carry license are included in the reported number of 500,000. However, there may be individuals who have obtained licenses from other counties or have moved to Cobb County with licenses from other counties, which may not be accounted for in the reported number.", "Exist alternative explanation": "State Rep. Rick Jasperse suggests that the number of licenses is actually about 750,000, which contradicts the reported figure of 500,000. This alternative explanation raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
