{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Mitt Romney refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The only evidence provided is a statement from a Romney adviser saying they will get back to the reporter on that question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's refusal to answer the question about the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act means he would have vetoed it. However, this is an assumption and cannot be proven without a clear statement from Romney himself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Romney's refusal to answer the question, such as wanting to gather more information or consulting with his advisers before making a statement. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
