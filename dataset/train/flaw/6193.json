{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are no definitive studies to prove or disprove the claim that insurance premiums decrease when licenses are granted to undocumented immigrants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing undocumented immigrants to get a driver's license and requiring them to have insurance would result in a significant drop in uninsured motorists, leading to a reduction in insurance premiums for everyone. However, the expert mentions that there are many factors involved in adjusting insurance rates, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of rate drops.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that while there is a logic behind the claim, it is challenging to attribute rate drops solely to granting licenses to undocumented immigrants. Other factors could be contributing to the decrease in insurance premiums in states that allow this practice.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict indicates that the claim may not be fully supported or substantiated, as there are no definitive studies or evidence to confirm the relationship between granting licenses to undocumented immigrants and a decrease in insurance premiums.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that in other states where illegal immigrants have been allowed to get driver's licenses, insurance premiums for everybody have gone down. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there is no conclusive evidence to support this statement.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the provided claim and expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of any exaggeration bias in the provided claim and expert's verdict."}
