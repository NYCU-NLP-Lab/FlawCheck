However, this assumption is not adequately supported or justified.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations and data that contradict the claim. It suggests that total nonfarm employment has actually increased in the mentioned states and nationwide since Trump took office, which challenges the claim's assertion that raising the minimum wage would have a greater impact on people's finances.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by providing data and evidence that challenges the assertion that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month. The expert's analysis suggests that the claim is not supported by the available facts.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
