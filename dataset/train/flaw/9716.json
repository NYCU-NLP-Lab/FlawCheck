{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of Governor Perry's comments about secession by presenting them as a casual response to a question about people shouting out the word \"secede.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully analyze the context and intent behind Governor Perry's comments.
