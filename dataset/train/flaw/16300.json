{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of dispute within the scientific community regarding the causes of global warming. The expert's verdict presents evidence from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program that contradict the claim's suggestion that the science is in dispute.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up its assertion that most or all of global warming is due to natural causes. The expert's verdict presents evidence from reputable scientific organizations that attribute the observed increase in global average temperatures primarily to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the weight of evidence supports the idea that most or all of global warming is due to natural causes. However, the expert's verdict presents evidence from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program that contradict this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for global warming and instead focuses solely on natural causes. The expert's verdict presents evidence from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program that attribute the observed global warming primarily to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting an alternative explanation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of reputable scientific organizations, such as the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which attribute the observed global warming primarily to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. The expert's verdict presents this contradiction.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of consensus among scientific organizations regarding the causes of global warming. The expert's verdict presents evidence from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program that support the conclusion that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly mention any specific instances of inconsistency or inconsistency in the claim."}
