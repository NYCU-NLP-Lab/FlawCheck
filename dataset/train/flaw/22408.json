{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of detainer requests refused by local authorities by stating that \"local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests. It only mentions a link to a news article without providing further details.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that participating in a voluntary, warrantless 'detainer' program will make the community less safe because it jeopardizes community trust. This assumption may be seen as problematic as it does not provide evidence or a clear link between detainer requests and community safety.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why local authorities may have refused detainer requests, such as concerns about civil liberties, legal issues, or disagreement with federal immigration policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that local officials in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont, and Wyoming honored all detainer requests, suggesting that detainers are relatively rare in those states. This contradicts the claim that detainers were refused in all 43 states mentioned.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing a clear and comprehensive picture of the detainer requests and how they were handled by local authorities. It lacks specific details, context, and additional evidence to support the statements made."}
