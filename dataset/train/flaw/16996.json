{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men, without providing specific evidence or data to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides anecdotal evidence from a mailer distributed by Mitt Romney's campaign and statistics from conservative bloggers and news outlets. There is no comprehensive analysis or data presented to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender pay gap within the White House is solely attributable to Barack Obama's policies and actions, without considering other factors that may contribute to the pay disparity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the gender pay gap within the White House, such as differences in job roles, experience levels, or educational backgrounds. The claim does not explore or acknowledge these potential alternative explanations."}
