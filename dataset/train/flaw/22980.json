{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is not clear what the blogger considers as a bailout and requests for information to back up the statement. This suggests that there may not be enough support for the claim that Paul Ryan voted for every bailout.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for every bailout is a negative trait, but it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were at least three votes taken by the House on bailouts, but it does not specify whether Paul Ryan voted for all of them. Therefore, there could be alternative explanations for the claim that Paul Ryan voted for every bailout."}
