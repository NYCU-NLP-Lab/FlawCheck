{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of cases being filed in the courts by stating that there are only 400,000 cases filed every year, while the expert's verdict mentions that they dispose of about 300,000 cases. This suggests that the actual number of cases filed may be higher than stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the statement about having one magistrate serving over 77,000 people. Although the expert's verdict mentions that there is a 'global average' for the number of judges and magistrates to the number of people, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for the number of people served by one magistrate. The expert's verdict mentions that in Kenya, there is one judge serving over 300,000 people, which suggests that the claim's focus on magistrates may not provide a complete picture of the judicial system.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented in the expert's verdict that the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget. This indicates that the claim may not accurately represent the allocation of resources to the judiciary.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in presenting a clear and consistent argument. The inclusion of statements about Africa Check's values, privacy policy, and support for independent fact-checking in Africa within the expert's verdict suggests a lack of focus on addressing the biases in the claim."}
