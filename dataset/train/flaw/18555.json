{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that there have been \"well over\" 54 million abortions since 1973, without providing specific data or evidence to support this number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that there have been \"well over\" 54 million abortions since 1973.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies on the use of emotionally charged language, such as \"abortion forced upon them\" and \"perverse proposal,\" which can be seen as an attempt to sway the audience's opinion rather than provide objective information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that all abortions are \"forced\" upon the babies, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not take into account the various reasons why women choose to have abortions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the number of abortions since 1973, such as changes in societal attitudes towards pregnancy and contraception, which could contribute to the overall number of abortions."}
