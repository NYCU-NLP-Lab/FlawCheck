{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to support the assertion that John McCain solicited campaign contributions from Russia.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the document in question was released by WikiLeaks in 2008 and not in 2017 as suggested by the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the document by referring to it as a \"breaking\" or \"bombshell\" revelation, even though it had been publicly available for several years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the document is authentic and accurately represents John McCain's actions, without questioning its credibility or potential motives behind its release.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential consequences and legal implications of a U.S. official soliciting illegal foreign donations, suggesting it would be \"incredibly foolish\" rather than addressing the seriousness of such actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the document, such as the possibility of it being sent to the Russian envoy unintentionally, as stated by McCain's campaign manager.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on questionable web sources and blogs as evidence, rather than reputable and reliable sources of information."}
