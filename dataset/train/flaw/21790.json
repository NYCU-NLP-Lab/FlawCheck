{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the funding is being diverted to non-road related projects. The expert's verdict states that only about 29 percent of the overall funding is being allocated to non-road projects.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the amount of funding being diverted to non-road related projects. The expert's verdict states that 29 percent of the overall funding is being allocated to non-road projects, which could be considered a significant amount.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that diverting 30 percent of the funding to non-road related projects is a negative action.

The expert's verdict mentions a chart in the governor's budget that supports the claim, but it does not provide further details or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of funding to non-road related projects. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either."}
