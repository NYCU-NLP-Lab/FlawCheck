{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of poverty among the elderly population in 1935 by stating that \"more than 50%\" lived in poverty. The expert's verdict suggests that the poverty rate for men and women aged 64 and older in 1939 was around 78%, which could be considered higher than the claim's statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement about the poverty rate in 1935. The expert's verdict mentions that data for individuals aged 65 and older are not available for the years 1960 through 1965, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the poverty rate in 1935 was significantly higher than the poverty rate in 2008 (9.7%). However, the expert's verdict mentions that data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses suggest a poverty rate of around 78% for men and women aged 64 and older in 1939, which challenges the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the poverty rate among the elderly population. It attributes the decrease solely to the effectiveness of social safety net programs without exploring other potential factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the poverty rate in 1935 due to the lack of available data and the reliance on estimates from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses. The expert's verdict suggests that the figure of 78% for 1939 may be a conservative estimate and that poverty was even higher in 1935."}
