{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of minimum wage earners who are not teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. The expert's verdict states that only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage, suggesting that a larger percentage of minimum wage earners may not fit the claim's description.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that typical minimum wage earners are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on statistics published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and research by various think tanks, but it does not provide specific data or sources to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that all minimum wage earners are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is not entirely accurate, as about 7 in 10 minimum wage workers are not teenagers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may overlook alternative explanations for the demographics of minimum wage earners. The expert's verdict mentions that a combination of teenagers, college students, and other young adults under 25 account for just over 50 percent of minimum wage workers, suggesting that there may be a broader range of individuals affected by the minimum wage."}
