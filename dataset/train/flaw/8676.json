{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because there is conflicting information from different sources regarding the authority of the Morton County Sheriff's Department to fine people bringing supplies to DAPL protesters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is based on conflicting reports and statements from different sources, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that anyone bringing supplies to DAPL protesters at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation could be fined $1,000 by the Morton County Sheriff's Department, without considering the differing views and statements from other authorities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as North Dakota's governor stated that regional authorities do not have the power to set up roadblocks or fine people carrying supplies to protesters, and that it is the responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to handle the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Morton County Sheriff's Department initially announced plans to block all supplies from entering Standing Rock camps, but later backed away and stated that they would take a more \"passive role\" by issuing fines for vehicles attempting deliveries.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential violation of human rights by describing the situation as a \"gross violation\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
