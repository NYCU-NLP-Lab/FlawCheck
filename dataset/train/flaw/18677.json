It does not explore factors such as tax credits or deductions that may have contributed to this outcome.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the percentage of American households that paid no income tax in 2009. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is correct.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times. The expert's verdict supports the claim's accuracy."}
