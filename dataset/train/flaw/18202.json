{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage. The expert's verdict mentions that there were not enough votes in the House to pass a bill, but it does not provide any concrete data or polls to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of support in the House for same-sex marriage legislation reflects the opinion of the general public. However, the expert's verdict highlights that people who contact their legislators may not necessarily reflect the opinion of the majority, and that legislators don't always vote with the majority of their constituents.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its assertion due to the lack of updated numbers or polls to support the claim. The expert's verdict mentions that the executive director of National Organization for Marriage - Rhode Island based his assertion on the belief that a majority of residents had contacted their legislators to object to same-sex marriage. However, this belief may not accurately represent the overall sentiment of the people of Rhode Island.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that calls coming into the House Speaker's office were fairly evenly divided between those in favor of same-sex marriage and those opposed. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the lack of support in the House, such as differing opinions among legislators or other factors influencing their decisions.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the level of support for same-sex marriage in Rhode Island. The expert's verdict mentions that in a survey conducted by the National Organization for Marriage - Rhode Island, a majority of those with an opinion actually endorsed same-sex marriage. This suggests that there may be a significant level of support for same-sex marriage among the residents of Rhode Island.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradictory facts in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
