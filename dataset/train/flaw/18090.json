{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Bill McCollum has accepted \"thousands\" from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood without providing specific evidence or amounts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's investigation only found a potential connection between Arnold & Porter (the lobbying firm) and Planned Parenthood, but no concrete evidence of McCollum accepting money from Planned Parenthood lobbyists.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that accepting money from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood automatically implies being influenced or in the pocket of the pro-choice group, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for any potential connection between Arnold & Porter and Planned Parenthood, such as the firm providing legal or lobbying services unrelated to financial contributions.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because the expert's investigation suggests that the claim might hold up, but it is not conclusive or definitive."}
