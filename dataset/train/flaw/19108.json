{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Romney and Ryan's stance on outlawing abortions, as it does not provide enough evidence to support the assertion that they both backed proposals to outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Romney and Ryan both supported proposals to outlaw abortions in cases of rape or incest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney and Ryan's positions on abortion are the same, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or positions that Romney and Ryan may have held on the issue of abortion, such as their stance on exceptions for the life of the mother.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting Romney's position on abortion and failing to provide accurate information about his stance on exceptions for rape and incest.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Romney has stated he would allow abortion when the life of the mother is in jeopardy, which was not initially mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of Romney and Ryan's positions on abortion by oversimplifying their stance to simply outlawing abortions in cases of rape or incest."}
