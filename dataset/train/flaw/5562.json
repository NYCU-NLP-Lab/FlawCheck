{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of pro-democracy demonstrators killed by Myanmar's military after the coup. The claim states that the photo shows demonstrators killed, but there is no direct evidence or confirmation of this in the provided information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photo shows pro-democracy demonstrators killed by Myanmar's military after the coup. The provided information includes the photo's publication on Twitter and its association with anti-coup protests, but there is no direct verification or confirmation of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo depicts pro-democracy demonstrators killed by Myanmar's military after the coup. However, the photo was previously published in relation to a different event, namely a landslide in Hpakant, Myanmar, in July 2020. Without further evidence or confirmation, it is a problematic assumption to link the photo specifically to the military's actions after the coup.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the photo, as it was previously published in relation to a landslide incident in Hpakant, Myanmar. This alternative explanation suggests that the photo may not be directly related to the pro-democracy demonstrations or the military's actions after the coup."}
