{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that at least two former first ladies, Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, have visited U.S. troops in designated combat zones since 1969.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of first ladies who have visited troops in combat zones since 1969, as it implies that Melania Trump is the only one.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Melania Trump is the first FLOTUS to visit troops in a combat zone since 1969.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that other first ladies have also visited troops in combat zones, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
