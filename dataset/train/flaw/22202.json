{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories since China joined the WTO in 2001 is supported by the expert's research using the U.S. Census data. Therefore, this bias does not exist in the provided claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert acknowledges that while China joining the WTO has had a significant and negative effect on American manufacturing, it is not the sole factor responsible for all the lost factories.
