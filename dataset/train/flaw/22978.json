{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that fresh protests have erupted in the UK against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The image used in the claim is old and has been previously associated with protests outside the Chatham House think tank in London. This suggests an alternative explanation for the image rather than it being a recent protest against President Kenyatta.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used is from a previous protest and not a recent one.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent and significance of the protests by presenting them as fresh and widespread, while the evidence suggests otherwise.", "Understate": "It is difficult to determine if there is any understatement bias in the claim as it does not provide enough information about the actual extent or nature of the protests.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an old image as evidence of fresh protests, which undermines its credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protests mentioned are recent and specifically against President Kenyatta, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption."}
