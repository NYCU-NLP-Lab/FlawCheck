{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decline in West Virginia teacher pay rank by stating that it \"plummeted\" from 30th to 48th. The data shows a decline, but the term \"plummeted\" implies a more drastic drop.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the statement that West Virginia teacher pay rank declined under Democratic control. It only mentions the change in rank without providing a comprehensive analysis or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Democratic control and the decline in teacher pay rank. It attributes the decline solely to Democratic control without considering other factors that may have contributed to the change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in West Virginia teacher pay rank, such as economic factors, changes in education policies, or budget constraints.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that West Virginia's teacher pay rank fell even further after the period mentioned. The claim states that the rank declined from 30th to 48th, but later data shows that it fell to 49th.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the decline in West Virginia teacher pay rank by only focusing on the period from 1990 to 2015. The data mentioned indicates that the decline started around 1970 and continued beyond 2015.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the decline in teacher pay rank. It simplifies a complex issue by attributing it solely to political control without considering other variables."}
