It is stated as a fact without any further information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the audience is aware of the context and background information related to the topic of electricity generation from wind. It does not provide any explanation or context for the statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the electricity generation sources in the three states mentioned.
