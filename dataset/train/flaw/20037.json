{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photo by stating that it is the \"only authentic photo in the world\" of Emperor Qianlong. However, it is later revealed that the photo was taken nearly 100 years after Qianlong's death, making it impossible for it to be an authentic photo of him.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo was taken in the late 19th century, long after Qianlong's death. This contradicts the initial claim that the photo shows Emperor Qianlong.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the photo is of Emperor Qianlong. The only evidence provided is the photo itself, which is later proven to be taken after his death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo is of Emperor Qianlong based solely on the caption provided. However, this assumption is proven to be false when the true origins of the photo are revealed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the photo is not of Emperor Qianlong but of unidentified individuals during the H.M.S. Challenger expedition. This alternative explanation is supported by the description of the photo provided by the Natural History Museum in London.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an inaccurate and misleading assertion about the photo's subject. It fails to provide accurate information about Emperor Qianlong and the true origins of the photo."}
