{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating because it states that Chris Christie \"cut equal pay for women,\" implying that he actively took measures to decrease pay for women.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Christie's actions were solely motivated by considering equal pay for women as \"senseless bureaucracy,\" without considering other potential reasons for his decisions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Christie's actions resulted in a reduction in equal pay for women.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Christie's actions, such as concerns about the specific provisions of the bills or their potential impact on businesses.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it presents the viewpoint of U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz without providing a comprehensive analysis of Christie's overall stance on equal pay for women.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the vetoed bill on narrowing the wage divide, as suggested by the research conducted by Yasemin Besen-Cassino."}
