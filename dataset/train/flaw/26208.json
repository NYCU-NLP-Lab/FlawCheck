{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the timing of the permission to engage and the mention of RPG in relation to the belief of the group being unarmed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that the group of men on the street was believed to be unarmed prior to the mention of RPG.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the permission to engage was given based solely on the mention of RPG and before the Reuters cameraman pulled up his camera, without considering other factors or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the soldiers may have had other reasons to believe the group was armed or posed a threat, aside from the mention of RPG."}
