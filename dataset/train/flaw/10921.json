{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"300,000 voters were turned away by the state's strict voter ID law\" lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence that such a large number of voters were actually turned away from polling places due to lack of photo identification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state's strict voter ID law was the sole reason for the alleged turning away of voters. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there were various factors at play and that there is no direct evidence linking the voter ID law to the alleged turnout.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump won the state of Wisconsin by a margin of 22,000 votes, not 27,000 votes as mentioned in the claim. This discrepancy undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of voters allegedly turned away by stating it as 300,000, which is 11 times higher than the actual margin of victory. This exaggeration may be used to imply that the election was \"rigged\" or unfair.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and accurate representation of the situation. It fails to acknowledge the ongoing recount and the expectation that Trump will still have won the state even after the recount. This omission weakens the claim's argument.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the alleged turning away of voters. The expert's verdict mentions that there were multiple factors at play, including the availability of free state IDs and the impact of the voter ID law on different racial and ethnic groups."}
