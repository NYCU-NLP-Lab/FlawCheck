{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the investigations and speculation on democracy, downplaying the extensive social media influence campaign conducted by Russia.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of the Mueller report, which concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion, not just through a couple of Facebook ads.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of Russia's efforts by characterizing it as merely \"buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent,\" ignoring the broader social media campaign and computer-intrusion operations carried out by Russia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the investigations and speculation have had a much harsher impact on democracy than the Russian interference.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the investigations and speculation have been more harmful to democracy than the Russian interference, without providing substantial evidence or rationale for this assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that both the Russian interference and the investigations/speculation have had negative impacts on democracy, rather than one being more harmful than the other."}
