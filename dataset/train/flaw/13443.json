{"Understate": "The claim may understate the issue of low teacher pay in Oklahoma by stating that they are \"close to striking\" and \"poorest paid teachers in the US.\" The expert's verdict confirms that Oklahoma's teachers are indeed among the lowest paid in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that Oklahoma gives nearly $500 million in tax handouts to energy companies. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim largely checks out, but there may be some minor caveats or limitations in the data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between low teacher pay and tax handouts to energy companies in Oklahoma. While the claim presents this as a cause-and-effect relationship, it does not provide sufficient evidence to support this assumption."}
