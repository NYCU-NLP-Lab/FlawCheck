{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does conduct monitoring of vaccine safety, as stated by experts and the agency itself.", "Understate": "The claim understates the efforts made by the Health and Human Services in monitoring vaccine safety, as they have established systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse events.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post and does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the lack of specific documents being turned over by the agency implies a lack of monitoring of vaccine safety, which is not necessarily true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the absence of certain reports, such as administrative or procedural reasons, rather than a complete absence of monitoring."}
