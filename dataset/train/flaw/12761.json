However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the settlement was related to removing inactive voters from registration rolls and did not involve any admission of fraudulent voting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that California did not admit to any fraudulent voting. The expert's verdict provides statements from California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, both denying the existence of illegal votes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the settlement with Judicial Watch as an admission of illegal voting. The expert's verdict clarifies the purpose of the settlement and refutes the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the settlement with Judicial Watch.
