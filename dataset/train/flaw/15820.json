{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of sending more girls to school on boosting an entire country's GDP. The expert's verdict mentions that the findings are more limited than many people understand and that the \"girl effect\" seems to be stronger in middle-income countries compared to poorer nations.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy. The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal relationship between sending more girls to school and boosting a country's GDP.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that a stronger economy can provide resources and incentives to educate more women, which in turn can boost the economy. However, it also mentions that in some regions, social and religious reasons may limit women's ability to work or fully benefit from their education. This alternative explanation suggests that factors other than education alone can impact a country's GDP.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between educating girls and boosting a country's GDP. The expert's verdict highlights the limitations and complexities of this relationship, indicating that the claim may oversimplify a complex issue."}
