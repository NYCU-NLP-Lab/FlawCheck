{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that school students in Central India were shouting pro-Pakistan slogans, when in fact they were shouting \"Long live Sabir Sir\" which sounds similar to \"Long live Pakistan\".", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that the students were shouting pro-Pakistan slogans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the students were shouting pro-Pakistan slogans based on a misunderstanding of what they were actually saying.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the situation, stating that the students were shouting in support of their principal due to an internal issue between the school principal and authorities."}
