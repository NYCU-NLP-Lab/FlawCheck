{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the \"war on coal\" by stating that there is no war on coal, despite the rhetoric from Republicans and concerns raised by the public.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in coal production and jobs in Ohio is solely due to the actions of the Obama administration, without considering other factors that may have influenced these numbers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in coal production and jobs in Ohio, such as market demand or technological advancements, that are not addressed in the claim."}
