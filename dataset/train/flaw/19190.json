{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of temples discovered inside Muslim homes after demolition for the Kashi Vishwanath corridor. The expert's verdict mentions that \"at least 40 ancient temples\" were rediscovered, but the claim asserts that \"45 old temples were discovered inside these houses.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the demolition of Muslim homes for the construction of the corridor is solely based on religious grounds. The expert's verdict mentions that the government is providing compensation for the demolished houses, but the claim implies that the houses were demolished specifically because they belonged to Muslims.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that 45 temples were discovered inside Muslim homes. The expert's verdict does not mention any specific evidence or sources either.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor Project aims to provide direct access to pilgrims between the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the ghats of river Ganga. The claim, however, does not consider alternative explanations for the demolition of houses and focuses solely on the discovery of temples inside Muslim homes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that all the people named in the list of properties purchased for demolition are Hindus. The claim implies that Muslim homes were demolished for the construction of the corridor."}
