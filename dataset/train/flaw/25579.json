{"Exaggerate": "The claim of saving \"our nation more than $2 trillion\" is an exaggeration because the updated estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is $1.75 trillion.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accuracy because it relies on an outdated estimate from the CBO, which was later revised.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it only cites the GOP proposal and an outdated CBO report, without considering the revenue and saving sides of the program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that repealing Obamacare would result in significant savings without considering the potential increase in deficits, as concluded by the CBO in a previous analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the reduced cost estimate, such as improvements in health care efficiencies and fewer cancellations of insurance plans."}
