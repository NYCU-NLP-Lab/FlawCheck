However, there is no evidence or explanation provided to support this assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the issue by suggesting that the removal of the word \"Hindu\" from the form is comparable to the actions of the Britishers and Mughals. This comparison may be seen as an exaggeration or an attempt to create controversy.", "Falters at times": "The claim is based on tweets and statements from individuals, some of whom have been found sharing misinformation in the past. This raises questions about the reliability and credibility of the sources.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the use of the term \"Non-Minority\" in the form. It is possible that the term was used to encompass all non-minority religions, including Hinduism, rather than specifically excluding the Hindu religion."}
