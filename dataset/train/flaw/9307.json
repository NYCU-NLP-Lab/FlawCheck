{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the prevalence or frequency of students tricking their instructors into believing their exam booklets were lost. The expert's verdict mentions that there are \"no shortage\" of such tales, but it doesn't provide any concrete evidence or statistics to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the existence of the described scenario. It relies on anecdotal evidence and urban legends, rather than presenting factual data or research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the instructor would believe the student's trick and award them a higher score. This assumption may not always hold true and can vary depending on the instructor's awareness and vigilance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the student's success in receiving an undeserved A. It solely focuses on the student's trickery, without exploring other factors that could have influenced the instructor's decision."}
