{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to confirm that Rick Perry spoke favorably of binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas in 2001. The provided information only mentions that Santorum insinuated this, but there is no direct evidence or specific source cited.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Santorum's statement about Perry's speech is accurate and reliable, without questioning or verifying the source of this information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Perry's speech in 2001, such as discussing the concept of binational health insurance without necessarily expressing support for it. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state Department of Insurance in Texas is not aware of insurers offering cross-border plans, suggesting that Perry's alleged support for binational health insurance may not be accurate.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential concerns and criticisms related to binational health insurance, particularly regarding the quality of care provided by Mexican health care providers and the lack of state monitoring.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and direct connection between Rick Perry's speech in 2001 and his stance on binational health insurance. The information provided is mostly background information about the concept of binational health insurance and its implementation in other states, rather than directly addressing Perry's alleged support."}
