{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the aerial view of tents is related to the protesting farmers. The only evidence provided is social media posts and a reverse image search, which leads to a travel website featuring pictures from the Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the aerial view of tents is directly linked to the farmers' protest without providing any concrete evidence or verification. It relies on social media posts and captions without considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the aerial picture of tents is from the Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013, as confirmed by the photographer and the travel website. This suggests that the claim's association of the tents with the farmers' protest may be incorrect.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the aerial picture of tents is not related to the protesting farmers but rather from a different event, the Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013. The photographer himself confirmed this fact.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the misinformation being spread on social media. It mentions that the tweet was deleted, but it does not highlight the potential impact of the misinformation being shared and retweeted by hundreds of people.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim."}
