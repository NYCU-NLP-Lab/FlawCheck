{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that telling Siri to \"charge my phone to 100 percent\" will cause it to dial 911 or summon emergency services. The expert's verdict mentions that there was a bug in the past, but it was reportedly fixed within a day. However, there is no current evidence or proof provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Siri will surreptitiously dial 911 or summon emergency services when prompted with the specific phrase. However, the expert's verdict states that telling Siri \"charge my phone to 100 percent\" will not do anything but prompt an apologetic response that the request is not within her abilities. This contradicts the assumption made in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the rumored feature of Siri dialing emergency services when prompted with the phrase is not true. The expert's testing and Twitter users' attempts were unsuccessful in activating Siri's supposed secret 911 call feature.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential consequences or implications of Siri dialing 911 or summoning emergency services without the user's intention. It suggests that the feature could be used as a furtive way of contacting help in threatening situations, but it does not fully explore the potential negative outcomes or complications that could arise from such unintended calls.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the rumor of Siri dialing emergency services may have evolved from a bug associated with Siri in the past. This alternative explanation implies that the claim's assumption of intentional functionality may be incorrect or exaggerated."}
