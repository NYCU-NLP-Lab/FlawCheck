{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the trade loss with Canada by stating it is close to $100 billion a year, while the official statistics show a trade surplus of $2.8 billion in 2017.", "Understate": "The claim understates the trade surplus with Canada by not acknowledging the official statistics that show a surplus.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or data to substantiate the $100 billion loss.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trade deficit with Canada represents a loss, which is a problematic assumption as economists do not universally view bilateral balances as significant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the trade deficit may be due to trade in goods only and not services, as well as the inclusion of re-exports in the $100 billion figure."}
