{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated because it presents the $6.2 trillion figure as a definite estimate of the long-term deficit caused by Obamacare, when in reality it is based on a specific scenario and assumptions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide detailed information or evidence to back up the $6.2 trillion estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the GAO report definitively states that Obamacare will add $6.2 trillion to the long-term deficit, when in fact the report presents two different scenarios with varying outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for the impact of Obamacare on the long-term deficit, as different scenarios and assumptions can lead to different conclusions."}
