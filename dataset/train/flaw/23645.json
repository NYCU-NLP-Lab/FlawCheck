{"Exaggerate": "The claim of the photograph showing a lion and a zebra peacefully drinking together exaggerates the coexistence and peaceful behavior between these animals in the wild.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that lions and zebras peacefully drink together in the wild.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph accurately represents the behavior of lions and zebras at a watering hole, which is a problematic assumption given the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that the photograph was digitally created for an advertisement, thus challenging its authenticity."}
