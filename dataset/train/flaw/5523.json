{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which countries are making money off of peacekeeping troops. While there is a financial incentive for certain nations, money is not the only factor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that countries are contributing troops solely because they are making money off of them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that countries are contributing troops primarily for financial gain, without considering other motivations such as gaining field experience, training, or international prestige.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the alternative explanation that countries may contribute troops for reasons other than financial gain, such as fulfilling their international obligations or promoting stability in conflict-ridden regions."}
