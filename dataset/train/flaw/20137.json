{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Joe Biden that \"150 million people have been killed [by guns] since 2007\" is an exaggeration. The actual number of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. during that period is estimated to be around 429,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it contradicts the available data on firearm-related deaths. The number provided by Biden is significantly higher than the actual statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "Biden's statement assumes that all firearm-related deaths since 2007 are directly attributable to the immunity given to gun manufacturers. This assumption is problematic as it oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to gun violence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in firearm-related deaths since 2007, such as changes in gun ownership rates, mental health issues, or other social factors. Biden's claim solely attributes the increase to the immunity given to gun manufacturers.", "Falters at times": "While Biden's statement can be seen as a momentary lapse or mistake, it still reflects a significant factual error. This suggests that the claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in this claim. Biden's statement significantly overstates the number of firearm-related deaths since 2007.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual number of firearm-related deaths since 2007 is much lower than the number stated by Biden."}
