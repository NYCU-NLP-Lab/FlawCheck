{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the difference between the amount set aside for debt repayment and the money allocated for development expenditure. Without specific numbers or evidence, it is difficult to determine the extent of the exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that the amount set aside for debt repayment is much higher than the money allocated for development expenditure. Without sufficient supporting information, it is challenging to evaluate the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the amount set aside for debt repayment should not be higher than the money allocated for development expenditure. However, it does not provide any rationale or context to support this assumption, making it a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in allocation between debt repayment and development expenditure. It presents a simplistic view without exploring other factors that may influence budgetary decisions."}
