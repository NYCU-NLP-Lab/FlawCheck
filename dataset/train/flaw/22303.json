{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential harm caused by radiation from thermometer guns to the brain. The expert's verdict states that the claim is false and provides evidence from experts stating that the thermal gun only measures temperature with infrared radiation, which is reflected by objects and does not use laser light or radioactive beams. However, it is possible that the potential harm caused by prolonged exposure to infrared radiation is being understated in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence from experts and health authorities stating that the claim is false. The expert's verdict includes statements from Indonesian health ministry official Achmad Yurianto and the US Food and Drug Administration, which contradict the claim. Therefore, the claim lacks sufficient evidence to support its assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that radiation from thermometer guns causes \"damage\" to the brain. The expert's verdict provides evidence from experts and health authorities stating that this assumption is incorrect. The assumption is based on misinformation and lacks scientific support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that thermometer guns only measure temperature with infrared radiation, which is reflected by objects. The expert's verdict suggests that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of how thermometer guns work and their potential impact on the brain."}
