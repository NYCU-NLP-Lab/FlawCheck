{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that a Huntley and Palmers biscuit tin included risqu\u00e9 images on its lid. It is based on a collection of biscuit tins accumulated by Count de Salis and a tin featuring an illustration of an Edwardian garden party.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of risqu\u00e9 images on the biscuit tin was a deliberate act of revenge by a disgruntled, sacked employee. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or direct statements from the company or employees involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the risqu\u00e9 images on the biscuit tin lid, such as a mistake or oversight during the design or manufacturing process. The claim does not explore or consider these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the naughty details on the tin lid remained unnoticed until a shopkeeper spotted them with a magnifying glass years later. This contradicts the idea that the inclusion of the risqu\u00e9 images was a deliberate act of revenge by a disgruntled employee.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the risqu\u00e9 images on the biscuit tin lid by describing them as \"scabrous\" and implying that they were a major scandal or controversy. The evidence provided suggests that the images went unnoticed for a long time and were not widely known or discussed.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and concise explanation of how the risqu\u00e9 images came to be part of the biscuit tin artwork. It provides a possible explanation involving a disgruntled employee, but this explanation is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact or consequences of the inclusion of risqu\u00e9 images on a product marketed for children. It does not explore the potential backlash or negative effects on the company's reputation or sales."}
