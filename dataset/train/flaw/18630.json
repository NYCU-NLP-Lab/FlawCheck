{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of safety for women who are not in college compared to those who are in college. The statement suggests that it is significantly safer to not be in college, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that it is safer to not be in college than to be in college regarding sexual assault against women. The evidence provided is based on limited surveys and studies that do not include non-students for comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the risk of sexual assault is significantly higher for women in college compared to their non-college-bound peers. This assumption may not be supported by comprehensive data or a systematic study.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the higher rates of sexual assault among college women, such as increased reporting or awareness on college campuses, rather than solely attributing it to being in college."}
