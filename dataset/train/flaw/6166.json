{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated in stating that Tim Kaine \"reduced higher education funding by 25 percent\".

The expert's verdict does not address this assumption directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations for the claim."}
