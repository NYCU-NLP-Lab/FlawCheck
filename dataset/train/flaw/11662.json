{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as there is no official announcement or confirmation from any reliable source about the reunion of the Friends cast.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actors from Friends are reuniting for another season of the series based on a Facebook post with misspellings and a newly created account, which is a problematic assumption.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the unlikelihood of a Friends reunion by not emphasizing the repeated disclaimers from the show's creators and cast members that such an event will never happen.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no official announcement or confirmation has been made by any cast member, NBC, or the production companies involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the Facebook post, such as a hoax or a fan-made announcement without any basis in reality."}
