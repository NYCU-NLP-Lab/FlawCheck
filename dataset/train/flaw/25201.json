{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of nuns who were barred from voting by stating that \"Ten retired nuns were barred from voting in the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary.\" The evidence suggests that some nuns were turned away, but it does not specify the exact number.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the nuns were barred from voting solely due to a lack of photo identification. The evidence presented suggests that the nuns had alternative forms of identification, such as passports, but chose not to present them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the nuns were barred from voting solely due to a lack of photo identification, without considering other potential reasons for their inability to vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence suggests that the nuns had alternative forms of identification but chose not to present them. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for their inability to vote, such as their own decision not to comply with the identification requirements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the nuns did have alternative forms of identification, such as passports, which were acceptable under Indiana's voter ID law.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the situation. It presents a one-sided view without considering the alternative explanations or the nuns' own choices in not presenting their alternative forms of identification."}
