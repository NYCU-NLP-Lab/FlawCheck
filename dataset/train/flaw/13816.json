{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of reducing pension payments by stating that it cost billions of dollars and was like borrowing at a very high interest rate. This is because the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support these statements.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the role of other factors in contributing to Illinois' pension debt, such as economic downturns, mismanagement, or inadequate funding policies. The claim solely attributes the debt to the reduction in pension payments by the General Assembly.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that reducing pension payments cost billions of dollars and was like borrowing at a very high interest rate. It relies on the opinion and statements of Governor Bruce Rauner without providing additional sources or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in pension payments directly caused the increase in pension debt without considering other potential factors or variables that could have contributed to the debt.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the pension debt, such as changes in demographics, investment performance, or the overall financial health of the state. It solely focuses on the reduction in pension payments as the primary cause."}
