{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Vice President Biden's involvement in pressuring Ukraine to fire the prosecutor. The expert's verdict states that Biden's position was in line with official U.S. foreign policy and was supported by governments and anti-corruption organizations in Europe.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Vice President Biden \"forced\" Ukraine to fire the prosecutor. The expert's verdict mentions that Biden did pressure Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, but there is no evidence connecting it to his son's role in the Ukrainian gas company Burisma.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct connection between Vice President Biden's actions and the company paying his son. However, the expert's verdict states that there is no evidence linking the prosecutor's firing to his son's role in the company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Vice President Biden's position, stating that it was in line with official U.S. foreign policy and was supported by governments and anti-corruption organizations in Europe. This suggests that there may be alternative reasons for his actions beyond personal gain."}
