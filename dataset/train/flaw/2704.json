{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that \"4,400 Americans are dead, 30,000 severely wounded and more than 100,000 are suffering from serious health problems related to post-traumatic stress syndrome.\" The expert's verdict contradicts this by providing different numbers for American troops killed and wounded in Iraq.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered to understate the number of Americans who are suffering from serious health problems related to post-traumatic stress syndrome. The expert's verdict does not provide an alternative number or refute this specific part of the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the numbers mentioned. The expert's verdict relies on data from GlobalSecurity.org and the U.S. Department of Defense to verify the number of American troops killed and wounded.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal link between the war in Iraq and the health problems related to post-traumatic stress syndrome. The expert's verdict does not address this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the number of American casualties and health problems mentioned. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations either."}
