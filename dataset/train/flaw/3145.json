{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Romney wrote in his book that his health care plan should be expanded nationwide and then removed that statement in the paperback version. However, the expert's verdict explains that the difference between the editions was due to the changing context of the health care debate, not a deliberate removal of the statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Romney removed the statement from his book. The expert's verdict provides the actual text from both editions, which shows that the statement was modified but not completely removed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in the book's content was intentional and meant to hide Romney's previous support for a nationwide health care plan. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the change was a result of the evolving health care debate and not a deliberate attempt to contradict previous statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the change in the book's content, stating that it was influenced by the evolving health care debate and the similarities between Romney's plan and the Democratic plan that passed without a public option."}
