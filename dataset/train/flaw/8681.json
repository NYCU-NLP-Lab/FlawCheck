{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of insecurity associated with sending Social Security checks through the postal service. The expert's verdict states that the requirement for electronic payment transfers was not due to security concerns.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Social Security checks have not been sent through the postal service since 2013. The expert's verdict mentions that about 850,000 checks are still mailed each month.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for not sending Social Security checks through the postal service is due to security concerns. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the switch to electronic payment was mandated by a 1996 federal law, not because of security concerns.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by the expert's verdict, which highlights the 1996 federal law requiring electronic payment transfers as the reason for the change, not security concerns."}
