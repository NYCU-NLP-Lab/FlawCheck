{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that it is against the law for parents to tell their parents what they were tested on, when in reality, it is against the law for students to share test specifics after the test.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that parents are being told it is against the law to share test information with them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current testing rules prevent parents from knowing what their children were tested on, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why students may be hesitant to share test information with their parents, such as fear of disappointing them or facing consequences for poor performance."}
