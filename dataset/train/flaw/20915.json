{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential for mRNA vaccines to alter or damage human DNA. The expert's verdict explains that this assertion is scientifically baseless and there is no evidence to support it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to back up the assertion that mRNA vaccines can alter or damage human DNA. The expert's verdict states that this is a scientifically baseless claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that mRNA vaccines directly intervene in the genetic material of the patient and alter their individual genetic material. However, the expert's verdict explains that this is not the case and there is no scientific basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations or scientific explanations for the mechanism of mRNA vaccines. The expert's verdict provides a scientific explanation for why mRNA vaccines do not alter human DNA or cause genetic damage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts factual information provided by the expert's verdict, which states that mRNA vaccines do not alter or damage human DNA. The claim presents a false assertion that is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions within the claim itself.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information. It presents an exaggerated and unsupported assertion rather than downplaying or understating the potential effects of mRNA vaccines."}
