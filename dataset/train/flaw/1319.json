{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any changes or refinements made to the global surface temperature records are politically motivated and aimed at rewriting history.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation of faked data, as it relies on a comparison of two versions of the GISTEMP record without considering the reasons for the changes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on new data, statistical analyses, and historical insights, which is a standard practice in climate science.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the accusation of faked data without providing substantial evidence or considering the scientific process behind data refinement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the changes in the GISTEMP record, such as improved measurement techniques or data corrections."}
