{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that 57 mega dams were included in the manifesto. It only mentions that Ruto was correct about the party's manifesto pledge on dams, but there is no further information or evidence provided.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Ruto was mostly correct in his claims about the firing of ministers and the development of public land, but it also points out that he was not entirely accurate in his claim about the number of ministers asked to step aside. This suggests that Ruto's statements may not always be completely accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the construction of 57 mega dams is a feasible and realistic goal. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any analysis or evidence to support or challenge this assumption. It is unclear whether the construction of such a large number of mega dams is technically, financially, and environmentally feasible.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not mention any alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the claim. It simply states that Ruto was correct about the party's manifesto pledge on dams without considering any other possible interpretations or motivations behind this pledge.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state that the claim exaggerates the number of mega dams included in the manifesto. However, since there is no specific evidence or data provided to support the claim, it is possible that the claim may be an exaggeration or an overstatement.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any indication that the claim understates the number of mega dams included in the manifesto. However, without specific evidence or data, it is difficult to determine if the claim is an understatement.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not mention any contradictory facts regarding the claim. It only states that Ruto was correct about the party's manifesto pledge on dams. However, without further evidence or data, it is unclear if this claim contradicts any established facts."}
