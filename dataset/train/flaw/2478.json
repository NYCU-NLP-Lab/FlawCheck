{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the national debt by stating that it added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year. The expert's verdict clarifies that these numbers are not overall debt totals but rather long-term projections of the costs of maintaining Social Security and Medicare under present-day conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the stated numbers. The expert's verdict mentions that the numbers cited by the claim come from a House Budget Committee presentation and Government Accountability Office reports, but it clarifies that these numbers are projections and not overall debt totals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inclusion of entitlement spending significantly increases the national debt. However, the expert's verdict explains that the numbers cited by the claim are projections of the costs of maintaining entitlement programs over 75 years and not actual debt totals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the numbers cited in the claim are projections of the \"fiscal gap,\" which is a measure of the shortfall between revenues and spending promises for entitlement programs. This alternative explanation suggests that the numbers do not represent the actual national debt but rather the estimated costs of maintaining entitlement programs."}
