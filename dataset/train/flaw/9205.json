{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sen. Robert Menendez is not currently on trial for corruption and was not convicted. His co-defendant was also not convicted on prostitution charges.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Menendez's co-defendant was \"convicted and is getting life in prison\" in a case involving selling underage girls into prostitution, which is inaccurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the allegations made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Menendez is guilty of corruption and involvement in underage prostitution without any solid evidence or conviction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Menendez was tried on corruption charges but was not convicted, and his co-defendant was found guilty of defrauding Medicare in an unrelated case."}
