{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which ozone pollution in Rhode Island comes from outside sources. The expert's analysis suggests that the issue is more complicated and that the chemistry of ozone and its distribution is not solely determined by sources outside the state.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that 95% of ozone pollution in Rhode Island comes from outside sources, particularly the Midwest. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to ozone pollution and may not accurately represent the situation in Rhode Island.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 95% of ozone pollution in Rhode Island comes from outside sources. The expert's analysis highlights the complexity of ozone chemistry and the need for further investigation to determine the true sources of pollution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there are alternative explanations for the sources of ozone pollution in Rhode Island, including local factors such as NOx emissions from the interstate highway. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that the majority of ozone pollution comes from outside the state."}
