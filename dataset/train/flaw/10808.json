{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the estate tax by stating that only \"two out of every 1,000 people\" paid it in 2016. This could be seen as downplaying the significance of the tax.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that the estate tax is primarily paid by the ultra-wealthy and that the majority of people will never encounter it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose or impact of the estate tax, such as its potential role in wealth redistribution or revenue generation for the government.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the use of the term \"death tax\" by Republicans, stating that it is a marketing tactic rather than an accurate description of the estate tax.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the estate tax by suggesting that it is only paid by the ultra-wealthy and that it is not a common tax.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of the estate tax as a tax that the vast majority of people will never encounter, as it does not provide enough evidence or context to support this assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the estate tax is primarily paid by the ultra-wealthy without providing sufficient evidence or considering other factors that may influence its impact."}
