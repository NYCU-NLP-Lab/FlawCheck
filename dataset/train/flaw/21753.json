{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the sources provided by the claimant did not provide a definitive source for the claim. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claimant's statement required deeper research and that the proportion of out-of-wedlock births has recently been stagnant. This suggests that the claim may not hold true in all cases and may falter at times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the economic role of single mothers is significant for the child based on the statistic that more than half of women under 30 who give birth do so outside of marriage. However, this assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other factors that contribute to the economic role of single mothers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decline in marriage rates and the acceptance of having children outside of marriage are contributing factors to the increase in out-of-wedlock births. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the phenomenon mentioned in the claim."}
