{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Facebook's stance on military emblems by stating that they do not consider them \"appropriate\" on their social network, without providing any evidence or official statement from Facebook to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Facebook deems military emblems inappropriate. The expert's verdict provides evidence to the contrary, stating that verified Facebook pages of military branches frequently and proudly display their emblems.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Facebook's objection to the display of military emblems is the reason for the removal of posts, without considering the possibility that it may be due to the objectionable material accompanying the emblems.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the claim, stating that instances where Facebook removes posts with military emblems are often due to the objectionable material accompanying the emblems, rather than the emblems themselves.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Facebook does not consider military emblems inappropriate, as stated by a representative from the company who confirmed that the emblems do not violate Facebook's community standards.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate information by suggesting that Facebook objects to military emblems, despite evidence to the contrary."}
