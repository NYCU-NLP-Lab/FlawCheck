{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact on the deficit by stating that \"$65 billion would be added to the deficit if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes,\" as the expert's analysis shows different figures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the stated amount of $65 billion being added to the deficit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing the tax cuts for people on the highest incomes to expire would directly result in a specific amount being added to the deficit, without considering other factors or economic dynamics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests alternative figures and sources, indicating that there are alternative explanations and perspectives on the impact of allowing the tax cuts to expire."}
