{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the folded American flag is \"Reserved Only For Fallen Veterans,\" when in fact, members of Congress routinely present flags that have flown over the U.S. Capitol as gifts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up its assertion that the folded flag is reserved only for fallen veterans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Pelosi's act of gifting a folded flag to George Floyd's brother goes against a tradition reserved only for military families, which is not accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no prescriptive rules stating that a flag cannot be given or folded by anyone, including Pelosi.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists, as the claim fails to consider that the folded flag was given as a symbol of shared commitment to securing justice for George Floyd and all victims of police violence, rather than solely as a military tradition."}
