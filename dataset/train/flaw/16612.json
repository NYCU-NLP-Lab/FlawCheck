{"Exaggeration": "The claim \"Crime in Germany is way up\" exaggerates the extent of the increase in crime.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that crime in Germany has significantly increased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between migration and increased crime without providing substantial evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the data provided by the German government, which shows a decrease in overall crime rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The increase in non-German suspects may have alternative explanations other than migration, such as changes in law enforcement practices or reporting methods."}
