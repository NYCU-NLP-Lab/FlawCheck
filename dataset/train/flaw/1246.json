{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that BJP leaders were thrashed in the northeast during a door-to-door campaign for CAA, NRC. The only evidence provided is a video circulating on social media, which is later debunked as a three-year-old incident from West Bengal.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident shown in the video actually took place in Darjeeling, West Bengal, and not in the northeast during a door-to-door campaign for CAA, NRC.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the video as evidence of BJP leaders being thrashed in the northeast, while it is actually a video from a different location and time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of BJP leaders being thrashed in Darjeeling, West Bengal, is related to the door-to-door campaign for CAA, NRC in the northeast, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the incident being a result of local political conflicts in Darjeeling, rather than a response to the CAA, NRC campaign.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by presenting the video as evidence of BJP leaders being \"thrashed\" during the campaign, when it actually shows a specific incident from a different context.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
