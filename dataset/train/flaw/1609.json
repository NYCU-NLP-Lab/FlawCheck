{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the tax cuts on real wages by stating that they fell by 1.8 percent. It is important to note that this is a single measurement and may not reflect the overall trend in wages.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on data from the PayScale Index, which is a calculation made by a private group. This data may not have the same level of credibility or robustness as official statistics compiled by the federal government.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the tax cuts and the decline in real wages. It does not consider other factors that could have influenced the change in wages during that period.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in real wages, such as changes in labor market conditions or other economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Paul Ryan that wages are rising. This contradiction suggests a lack of consensus or agreement on the state of wages and undermines the certainty of the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering in its argument by relying on a single measurement from the PayScale Index without considering other official statistical series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the potential impact of the tax cuts on real wages by only focusing on a 1.8 percent decline. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall effect on wages."}
