{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the problem by stating that 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida were not delivered. The expert's verdict mentions that the number is based on a tweet and that the actual situation might not be as severe as portrayed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a tweet and an article from Raw Story as sources, which may not provide enough evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if the mail-in ballots had been delivered, the battleground state of Florida could have turned blue. This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the complex factors that determine election outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that postal workers were manually postmarking ballots for expedited delivery, resulting in ballots never being scanned into the system. This alternative explanation suggests that the undelivered ballots may not necessarily indicate a failure of the USPS.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from a spokesman for Broward County, Florida, who claims that there were zero undelivered ballots in the county. This contradicts the claim that 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida were not delivered.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on social media posts and articles from Raw Story, which may not always provide accurate or reliable information."}
