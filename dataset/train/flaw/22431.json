{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Indian PM Modi by stating that he is consoling a 'martyr' widow on the telephone, implying a level of emotional support that may not be accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading video that has been shared on social media platforms, without providing substantial evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is recent and related to a specific event (the suicide attack in Indian-administered Kashmir), without verifying the actual timeline or context of the footage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video actually shows Modi speaking to a woman whose husband was killed at one of his rallies, which provides an alternative explanation to the claim that he is consoling a 'martyr' widow."}
