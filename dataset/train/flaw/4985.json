{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the existence of confinement camps by using language like \"internment camps\" and \"concentration camps\" to describe government-run quarantine facilities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the idea that Canada is building confinement camps. The provided information only mentions government-run quarantine facilities for international travelers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the quarantine facilities are designed to house a broad spectrum of people, not just travelers, without providing clear evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the purpose of the quarantine facilities, such as addressing the Covid-19 fourteen-day quarantine requirements for international travelers."}
