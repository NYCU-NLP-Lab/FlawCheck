{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"ten percent of violent deaths in the U.S. each year are due to strangulation\" lacks sufficient evidence or citation to support its validity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistic of ten percent is accurate without providing clear data or sources to back it up.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided for the statistic or any other factors that may contribute to violent deaths in the U.S.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the prevalence of strangulation as a cause of violent deaths if the statistic is accurate.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear whether the claim contradicts any factual information as the evidence to support or refute it is not provided.", "Exaggerate": "It is unclear if the claim exaggerates the prevalence of strangulation as a cause of violent deaths since there is no clear evidence to support or refute the statistic.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing sufficient evidence or citation to support the statistic, which raises doubts about its accuracy."}
