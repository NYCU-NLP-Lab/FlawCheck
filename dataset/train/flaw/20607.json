{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one example of a past president, Richard Nixon, holding meetings without an American interpreter. It does not provide additional evidence or examples to support the claim that this was a common occurrence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Nixon held meetings without an American interpreter, it is therefore acceptable for Trump to do the same. However, this assumption may not be valid as each president's actions and circumstances can vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Nixon held meetings without an American interpreter, such as his strained relationship with the State Department or concerns about leaks. It is not clear whether these same reasons apply to Trump's meeting with Putin.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of Trump's meeting with Putin without an American interpreter. The expert's verdict describes it as \"definitely unusual,\" suggesting that it may be more significant than just a historical precedent set by Nixon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump's meeting with Putin without an American interpreter is unusual. This contradicts the usual practice of having an aide or administration official and an American interpreter present during meetings with foreign heads of state."}
