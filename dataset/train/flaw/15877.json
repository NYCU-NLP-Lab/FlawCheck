{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the last ice age was caused by a cataclysmic collision of an asteroid contradicts scientific evidence that shows ice ages are primarily driven by cycles of ice ages over millions of years.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of erosion and sediment deposits as the \"far and away\" number one cause of sea level rise, which is not supported by scientific research that attributes sea level rise primarily to global warming.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating biases in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making false claims about river sediments, cliff rocks, and ice in Antarctica during a debate about the causes of sea level rise.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed by scientific evidence or consensus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that erosion and sediment deposits are the primary cause of sea level rise, which is a problematic assumption that goes against scientific consensus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for sea level rise, such as global warming and the melting of ice sheets."}
