{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the job losses when President Obama took office. The expert's analysis shows that the actual job losses were 17% higher than the claimed number.", "Understate": "The claim understates the duration of consecutive job growth. The expert's analysis shows that the last time the United States lost jobs was 22 months ago, not 24 as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement of consecutive job growth for 24 months. The expert's analysis shows that job growth was below 100,000 in 7 out of the 22 months.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that job growth is an indicator of a recovering economy, without considering other economic factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the job growth, such as the natural growth of the workforce or other economic policies."}
