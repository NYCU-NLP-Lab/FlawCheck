{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the issue by stating that Mitt Romney \"failed to disclose\" his corporation in Bermuda on seven different financial disclosures. While it is true that he did not disclose it on those specific disclosures, it is unclear if he failed to disclose it on other disclosures or if he has disclosed it on more recent disclosures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Mitt Romney \"failed to disclose\" his corporation in Bermuda. The expert's verdict mentions that the Romney campaign did not respond to requests for more current information on the status of the corporation, so it is uncertain if there is additional information that could support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's ownership of the Bermuda corporation is a problematic issue or implies wrongdoing. However, the expert's verdict mentions that offshore holdings may be perfectly legal and that Romney's investments are managed by a blind trust, following all U.S. laws and taxes being paid appropriately. The assumption of wrongdoing is not supported by the information provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's ownership of a corporation in Bermuda. The expert's verdict mentions that offshore holdings may be used for legal purposes, such as tax planning, and does not definitively state any wrongdoing on Romney's part."}
