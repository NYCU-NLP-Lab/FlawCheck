{"Exaggeration": "The claim states that \"Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time.\" This may be an exaggeration as there is no specific evidence or data provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that the available evidence is murky and that it is difficult to generate consistent results for this claim. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert also notes that the employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is imperfect for answering this question. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption or interpretation of the data."}
