{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the fiscal cliff deal \"ultimately raised taxes\" is contradicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that the deal will actually cut the money the federal government raises through taxes by $3.6 trillion through 2022.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the fiscal cliff deal on taxes, as it fails to consider the overall tax cuts implemented by the deal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides the opinion of one congressman, Tom Price, without providing additional evidence or analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fiscal cliff deal resulted in a tax increase without considering the broader context and impact of the deal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the conflicting viewpoints on whether the deal hiked taxes or cut them can be attributed to a matter of perspective."}
