{"Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the quote by James Cameron. While the claim only mentions that Cameron chose a cop as the villain in part because \"cops think of all non-cops as less than they are,\" the actual quote attributed to Cameron in the expert's verdict states that \"Cops think all non-cops as less than they are, stupid, weak and evil. They dehumanize the people they are sworn to protect and desensitize themselves in order to do that job.\" The claim fails to mention the full extent of Cameron's statement, potentially downplaying its severity.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason James Cameron chose a cop as the villain in \"Terminator 2\" is because \"cops think of all non-cops as less than they are.\" This assumption may be problematic as it generalizes the beliefs and attitudes of all cops, which can be seen as an overgeneralization and unfair characterization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why James Cameron chose a cop as the villain in \"Terminator 2.\" It solely focuses on the idea that cops view non-cops as inferior. However, there could be other factors or creative decisions involved in Cameron's choice that are not explored in the claim."}
