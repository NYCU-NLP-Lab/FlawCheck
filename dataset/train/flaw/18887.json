{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the benefits of Wisconsin's high-risk pool by stating that people could go to any doctor or hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than under Obamacare today.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential limitations and challenges of high-risk pools, such as whether there would be enough public funding allocated to make insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between the number of plans and the cost of premiums and co-pays in Wisconsin's high-risk pool versus Obamacare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high-risk pool in Wisconsin was universally successful and could be replicated on a national scale, without considering the potential differences and challenges in other states.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in premiums and co-pays under Obamacare, such as changes in healthcare costs, regulations, or other factors."}
