{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of terrorists at Guantanamo Bay who went back into battle by stating it as \"about 30 percent\", when in reality it includes both confirmed and suspected cases of re-engagement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that \"a dozen or so\" terrorists killed Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all prisoners who re-engaged in terrorism after release from Guantanamo Bay are \"not good people\" and \"the worst of the worst offenders\", without providing evidence for this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that the majority of released detainees who re-engaged or were suspected of re-engaging were released before Barack Obama took office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths of Americans in battle, such as the involvement of other non-Guantanamo Bay detainees or factors unrelated to released prisoners."}
