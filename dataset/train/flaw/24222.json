The product, called \"Mensez,\" has not been fully developed or even exist in prototype form.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove the effectiveness or feasibility of the labial glue as a menstrual alternative.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a chiropractor is qualified to develop a product for women's menstrual needs without firsthand knowledge of female anatomy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim raises the possibility that the inventor, Dan Dopps, may have ulterior motives or biases against women, as suggested by his inflammatory comments and lack of understanding of female anatomy."}
