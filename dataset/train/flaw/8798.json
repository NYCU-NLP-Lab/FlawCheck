{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the government's ability to force citizens to be vaccinated by misrepresenting the statements made by the Minister for Housing and the Nationals MP during a parliamentary session. The misleading video selectively cuts out crucial parts of their speeches to create a false impression that the government is actively seeking to force vaccination on citizens.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a misleading video that distorts the statements made by the Minister for Housing and the Nationals MP. The full context of their speeches, which is available in the original footage, contradicts the claim that the government can force citizens to be vaccinated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the rushed law change mentioned in the misleading video enables the government to force citizens to be vaccinated. However, the actual statements made by the Minister for Housing and the Nationals MP indicate that the legislation is focused on future-proofing and may include the potential requirement for vaccination in certain situations, such as entering New Zealand.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the government can force citizens to be vaccinated. The original footage of the parliamentary session, which was compared to the misleading video, clearly shows that the statements made by the Minister for Housing and the Nationals MP were taken out of context and do not support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, which is that the opposition party, Advance NZ / New Zealand Public Party, published the misleading video to create fear and misinformation about the government's vaccination policies. This alternative explanation suggests a biased intention behind the creation and dissemination of the video."}
