{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the time it would take for the economy to reach pre-pandemic levels by stating it would be achieved by 2025, while the expert's verdict states it would be in 2024.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that the economy wouldn't reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025. The expert's verdict provides the correct information from the CBO report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CBO report supports the statement that the economy wouldn't reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025, which is contradicted by the actual findings of the report.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact stated in the CBO report that the economy would reach pre-pandemic levels in 2024, not 2025.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation for the discrepancy, suggesting that the statement was referencing GDP instead of employment."}
