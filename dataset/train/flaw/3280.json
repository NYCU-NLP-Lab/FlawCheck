{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in gas prices by stating that it has increased by 25% when the actual increase is 15.9%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in gas prices is solely due to President Trump's actions, without considering other factors such as global economic conditions or geopolitical events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that there are other factors contributing to the rise in gas prices, including threats of a trade war with China, tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the price increase."}
