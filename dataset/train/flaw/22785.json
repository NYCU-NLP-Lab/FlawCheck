{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that there are \"zero dollars\" going to homeless veterans, when in fact, the American Rescue Plan includes $750 million for housing veterans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that there are no funds allocated for homeless veterans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $86 million spent on hotel rooms for immigrants means that there are no funds available for homeless veterans, which is a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the American Rescue Plan includes funding for housing and other support services for veterans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the funds allocated for immigrants and homeless veterans may come from different sources or be part of different programs."}
