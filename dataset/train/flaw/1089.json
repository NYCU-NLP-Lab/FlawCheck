{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the success of each budget under the Corbett administration by stating that they all finished \"in the black\" without increasing broad-based taxes.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the deficits that occurred during Governor Wolf's term by not mentioning them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to fully substantiate the assertion that each Corbett budget finished in the black.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a positive general fund balance at the end of each fiscal year means the budget was truly balanced and successful, without considering other factors or long-term implications.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the positive general fund balance, such as potential one-time federal stimulus funds or other financial maneuvers."}
