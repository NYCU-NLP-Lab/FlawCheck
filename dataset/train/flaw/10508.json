{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict states that the evidence supporting the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before winning the 2008 election is slim and ultimately insufficient.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama sent William Miller to Iran in 2008 to establish a back channel and inform the Iranians about friendlier terms if he were to win the election. However, this assumption is not adequately supported.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based solely on the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert, who has made this claim multiple times. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or perspectives regarding the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict includes information about Obama's administration pursuing back-channel communications with Iran after he took office, which contradicts the claim that these communications were sought before the 2008 election.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent and significance of the alleged back-channel communication, as it suggests that Obama sent Miller to establish a back channel and inform the Iranians about potential friendlier terms if he were to win the election. However, the evidence supporting this claim is limited."}
