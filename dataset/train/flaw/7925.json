{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Roy Barnes has been \"fighting hard\" to let illegal immigrants vote. The provided evidence suggests that Barnes filed a lawsuit challenging voter identification laws, but it does not support the claim that he was actively advocating for illegal immigrants to vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a website sponsored by the Republican Governors Association and a recorded message as evidence. There is no additional evidence or data provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Barnes' involvement with Georgia Appleseed, a nonprofit that provides advice on opening bank accounts without a Social Security number, means he was helping illegal immigrants get the vote. This assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Barnes' actions, such as his belief that voter identification laws were unconstitutional or his involvement with Georgia Appleseed for reasons unrelated to illegal immigration and voting."}
