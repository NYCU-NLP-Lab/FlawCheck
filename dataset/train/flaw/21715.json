More information or sources would be needed to fully support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths of the sisters. While it is stated that their symptoms were \"inline with COVID\" and that one sister had tested positive, there could be other factors contributing to their deaths that are not explored in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all thirteen sisters who died were tested for COVID-19, but it is stated that not all of them were tested. This assumption could be problematic as it may not accurately represent the cause of their deaths.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence or indication that the claim contradicts any factual information."}
