{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City. The evidence provided only states that 53% of \"frontline\" workers in the city are immigrants, but this definition does not include all essential workers, such as government workers and first responders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigrants make up a majority of essential workers without considering alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the composition of essential workers in New York City.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the composition of essential workers in New York City that are not considered in the claim. The claim does not explore other factors that may contribute to the demographics of essential workers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive definition of essential workers and relying on a specific definition from the New York City comptroller's office, which may not align with other definitions used by the state or other organizations.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the percentage of immigrants among essential workers in places like New York City since the evidence provided only mentions that 53% of \"frontline\" workers are immigrants, but this does not include all essential workers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the prevalence of immigrants among essential workers in places like New York City since the evidence provided does not support the claim that immigrants make up a majority of essential workers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the definition of essential workers used in the claim (based on the New York City comptroller's office) does not include all categories of workers listed in the state's definition, potentially leading to an inaccurate representation of the demographics of essential workers."}
