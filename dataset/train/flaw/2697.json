Paul Ryan without providing further details or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting the fiscal plan crafted by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan automatically means supporting the privatization of Social Security, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Duffy's support of the fiscal plan, such as supporting certain aspects of it but not necessarily advocating for the privatization of Social Security."}
