{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"long gas lines forming in North Korea\" is considered exaggerated by the expert. The expert states that while there have been gasoline shortages in North Korea, the idea of \"long gas lines\" is exaggerated due to the country's top-down control system and minimal levels of car ownership.", "Lack enough support": "The expert mentions that there is fragmentary news reporting out of Pyongyang regarding gasoline supplies in North Korea. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient evidence or support for the claim of \"long gas lines.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported gasoline shortages in North Korea are a direct result of the sanctions package approved by the United Nations. The expert points out that it is unclear whether these particular sanctions could have acted quickly enough to cause \"long gas lines\" within a week.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the gasoline shortages in North Korea began amid rumors that China was considering halting all crude oil sales. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the shortages, such as changes in oil supply from China."}
