{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which New York state gets back less from Washington compared to other states. The expert's verdict mentions that on a per-capita basis, New York ranked fourth, indicating that there are other states that receive less federal funding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that no state gets back less from Washington than New York state. The expert's verdict mentions a study by the Rockefeller Institute of Government, but also notes that there are alternative results when population is taken into account.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that New York state is being shortchanged by the federal government without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that New York had a cumulative shortfall, but does not delve into the reasons behind it or whether it is a deliberate action by the federal government.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be alternative explanations for New York state receiving less federal funding, such as differences in population, economic factors, or other state-specific circumstances. The expert's verdict mentions that there are other states with negative balances with the federal government as well."}
