{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the number of healthcare workers who have died from COVID-19 by stating that the artwork shows \"all\" doctors and nurses killed, when in reality, it may not include all cases globally.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the accuracy of the statement that the mosaic artwork includes all doctors and nurses who lost their lives to COVID-19. The provided evidence only shows that the artwork was created using photographs of healthcare workers who died, but it does not provide comprehensive data or evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mosaic artwork accurately represents all healthcare workers who have died from COVID-19, without providing concrete evidence or data to support this assumption. It may not take into account healthcare workers from all countries or regions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the mosaic artwork, such as it representing a tribute to healthcare workers in general, rather than specifically those who died from COVID-19. The claim does not provide enough context or information to rule out alternative explanations."}
