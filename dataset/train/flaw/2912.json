{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Indians are drowning religious statues for failing to offer COVID-19 protection. The evidence provided in the form of a Facebook post and video footage does not establish a widespread trend or provide a comprehensive understanding of the motivations behind these actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Indians are accepting Jesus in large numbers as a replacement for their religious statues. However, there is no substantial evidence provided to support this assumption. The claim relies on a single Facebook post that may not accurately represent the beliefs and actions of the entire Indian population.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Indians may be engaging in the act of drowning religious statues. It does not explore other cultural or religious practices that may be associated with the ritual depicted in the video footage.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the actions shown in the video footage by suggesting that it represents a widespread phenomenon. The evidence provided does not establish the scale or prevalence of these actions among Indians.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the ritual of immersing religious statues is a common practice in India, particularly during festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi. The claim presents the act of drowning statues as a new phenomenon caused by the perceived failure of the statues to offer COVID-19 protection, which contradicts the historical and cultural context of the ritual.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not directly relevant to the central assertion. The inclusion of information about COVID-19 cases and deaths in India, as well as the historical context of the ritual, does not directly support or refute the claim about Indians drowning statues.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
