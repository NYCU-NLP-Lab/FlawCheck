{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the financial situation of Americans by stating that \"half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that 52 percent of U.S. workers have less than $10,000 in total savings and investments, but this does not necessarily represent all Americans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on a survey of workers and retirees, which may not accurately represent the entire American population. The expert's verdict also mentions that the survey does not include homes or defined benefit plans, which could affect the overall savings picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having less than $10,000 in savings automatically leads to bankruptcy and financial disaster. The expert's verdict includes a quote from Sanders stating the potential consequences, but it does not provide concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the survey results show an increase in the percentage of workers reporting less than $10,000 in savings and investments from 2009 to 2014. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the financial situation of Americans, such as economic factors or changes in retirement plans.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not accurately representing the financial situation of all Americans. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is based on a specific survey of workers and retirees, which may not be representative of the entire population.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the financial situation of Americans.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts any known facts."}
