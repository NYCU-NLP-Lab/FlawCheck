{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the lack of budget allocation to the judiciary by stating that it does not even get 1% of the national budget. This bias suggests that the actual budget allocation may be higher than implied.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the workload of the judiciary by stating that only about 300,000 cases are disposed of while an average of 400,000 cases are filed every year. This bias suggests that the actual number of cases being handled by the judiciary may be higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget. This bias suggests that the claim lacks enough supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that one judge serving over 300,000 people and one magistrate serving over 77,000 people is a problematic situation. However, it does not provide further explanation or evidence to support this assumption. This bias suggests that the claim relies on a problematic assumption without sufficient justification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the budget allocation to the judiciary or the workload of judges and magistrates. This bias suggests that the claim may overlook other factors that contribute to the situation described."}
