{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that a woman shamed a Pakistani soldier at a protest in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in August 2019. The provided information includes a Facebook post, a screenshot, and a video from 2013, but there is no direct evidence or additional sources confirming the specific incident in question.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo and video from 2013 depicting women giving bangles to Pakistani security forces during a protest in Karachi is the same incident as the one described in the claim. However, there is no clear evidence or confirmation that these two events are related or that they took place in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in August 2019.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo and video are from 2013, which is six years prior to the claimed incident in August 2019. This raises doubts about the accuracy and relevance of the evidence provided to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the photo and video, which suggests that they depict a protest against claims of vote rigging in Karachi after Pakistan's general election in May 2013. This alternative explanation raises questions about the authenticity and context of the incident described in the claim.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the complexity and historical background of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. The claim briefly mentions the division of Kashmir and the two wars fought over the territory, but it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing conflict and its political complexities.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it does not make any specific claims or assertions that can be evaluated for exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a misleading Facebook post, outdated photo and video evidence, and a lack of direct evidence or confirmation of the specific incident described. These shortcomings weaken the credibility and reliability of the claim."}
