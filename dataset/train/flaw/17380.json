{"Exaggerate": "The claim in the video exaggerates by stating that Bongbong Marcos is the new vice president of the Philippines, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it misinterprets and misrepresents the information from The Manila Times article.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions taken by the Supreme Court Associate Justice Leonen indicate that Bongbong Marcos will become the new vice president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Leonen's actions, which is that he recommended a mere 'comment' on the case after sitting on it for 11 months. This does not necessarily mean that Marcos will become the new vice president."}
