{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in the minimum wage by stating that it has risen $2.35 in the last two years, which is actually the projected increase over three years if the new legislation is approved.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual increase in the minimum wage by stating that it has risen 31 percent, when in fact the increase is closer to 16.1 percent over two years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the stated increase in the minimum wage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the minimum wage increase is unacceptable and detrimental to small businesses without providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative perspectives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the minimum wage increase is not unprecedented as there have been larger percentage increases in the past, such as the 34.8 percent increase over three years in the late 1970s and early 1980s."}
