{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that Debra Medina was the No. 1 search on Google for the hour after the debate and No. 3 for the remainder of the night. The expert mentions that Google does not reveal top searches on an hour-by-hour basis and the Medina campaign did not respond to requests for clarification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the top search on Google immediately after a debate indicates significant interest or popularity. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete data or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation for Medina's claim, stating that she may have been referring to the spike in interest during the Jan. 14 debate rather than the overall number of searches for her name.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Google does not disclose specific rankings for searches on an hourly basis, as confirmed by a spokesman for Google.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the level of interest in Debra Medina by only focusing on her rankings during the debate. The expert mentions that she was the 13th \"fastest-rising\" search on Google on Jan. 14, indicating a significant increase in interest.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear and verifiable measure of Medina's search rankings on Google. The lack of response from Medina's campaign and the limitations of Google's disclosure contribute to the uncertainty of the claim."}
