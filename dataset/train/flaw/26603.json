However, the expert's research indicates that Lovejoy Surgicenter, a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center, is subject to regulation and site visits, suggesting that there may be some level of oversight and standards in place.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the perceived lack of state oversight and basic health or safety standards for abortion clinics in Oregon. The expert's research indicates that abortion clinics in Oregon may fall under different regulatory categories, such as ambulatory surgical centers, and may be subject to specific regulations and oversight within those categories."}
