{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential reduction in global temperature that could be achieved through full compliance with the Paris Agreement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the estimated reduction in global temperature.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Paris Agreement would only result in a minimal reduction in global temperature, without considering other potential factors or assumptions made by researchers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Other studies have shown greater reductions, indicating that there are alternative explanations and varying assumptions in calculating the potential impact of the Paris Agreement."}
