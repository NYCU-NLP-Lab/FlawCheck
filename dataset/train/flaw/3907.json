{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the Associated Press called Charlie Crist's attacks \"over the top,\" \"out of context,\" and \"not true.\" The expert's verdict suggests that the AP article labeled some of Crist's attacks as questionable, but does not explicitly state that they were all described in the exact terms mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that the Associated Press called Charlie Crist's attacks \"over the top,\" \"out of context,\" and \"not true.\" It simply mentions that an AP article was published, but does not provide any direct quotes or specific references to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the phrases \"over the top,\" \"out of context,\" and \"not true\" would not come from the Associated Press, a well-respected and impartial news organization. This assumption is questioned by the expert's verdict, which states that in this case, the AP did use these phrases in their analysis of Crist's attacks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the AP's characterization of Crist's attacks. It assumes that the AP's labeling of the attacks as \"over the top,\" \"out of context,\" and \"not true\" is solely due to their impartial analysis, without considering other possible factors that may have influenced their assessment."}
