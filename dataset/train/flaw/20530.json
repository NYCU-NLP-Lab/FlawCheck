{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate David Jolly's support for privatizing Social Security by stating that he \"supports privatizing Social Security\" without providing strong evidence or clear statements from Jolly himself.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information about Jolly's stance on privatizing Social Security. While the claim suggests that Jolly supports privatization based on his past advocacy and connections to individuals who favor privatization, it also mentions that Jolly has said he doesn't support the idea.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Jolly supports privatizing Social Security. It relies on indirect evidence, such as Jolly's past advocacy and connections, rather than direct statements or actions from Jolly himself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Jolly's past advocacy and connections automatically translate to his current stance on privatizing Social Security. It does not provide concrete evidence of Jolly's current position on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Jolly's past advocacy and connections to individuals who favor privatization. It does not consider the possibility that Jolly's involvement may have been purely professional or that his stance may have evolved over time."}
