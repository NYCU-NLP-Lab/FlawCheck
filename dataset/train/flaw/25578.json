{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Joe Biden's capital gains tax by stating that homeowners will owe taxes of 40% of their profit when selling their homes.

However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the tax increase would only apply to those making more than $1 million per year.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim."}
