{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration as it states that the United States spends more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and a couple of other small countries. However, the expert's verdict provides data from the OECD study showing that four countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland) actually spend more per student on secondary education than the United States.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement about the graduation rate and per-student spending. The expert's verdict mentions a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that compares per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations, but it does not provide specific data on the graduation rate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that high per-student spending should result in a higher graduation rate. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the federal government's cohort method shows the national average graduation rate to be about 81 percent, which is slightly higher than the claim's stated 80 percent. This suggests that there may be other factors influencing graduation rates besides per-student spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the federal government's National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country's wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student. This suggests that the claim's focus on per-student spending as the main factor in the graduation rate may overlook other factors such as socio-economic factors or educational policies."}
