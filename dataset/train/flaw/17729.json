{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Obama is planning on lighting the Empire State Building green to celebrate the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr on 11 September 2016. This is not accurate as the building will be lit \"Red, white and blue in memory of September 11\" on that date.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on online articles from fringe websites and does not provide any credible sources or evidence to verify the information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that lighting the Empire State Building green on 9/11 to honor a Muslim holiday would be highly insulting, given the events of 11 September 2001. This assumption may not be universally accepted and can be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the start of Eid-al-Adha was originally expected to fall on 11 September in 2016, but a number of prominent Muslim organizations declared that the festival will actually begin on 12 September. Therefore, lighting the Empire State Building green on 11 September would not align with the actual date of the festival."}
