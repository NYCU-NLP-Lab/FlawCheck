{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that there are national polls showing more Americans supporting impeachment and removal from office than those who oppose it. The claim only focuses on the swing states where a majority opposes impeachment, ignoring the broader national sentiment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data from polls to back up the statement that \"people don't want anything to do with impeachment.\" It is a general claim without sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the opinions of swing state voters represent the overall sentiment of the entire population. It assumes that the swing state polls are more relevant and accurate in determining public opinion on impeachment, which may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the difference in opinions between swing states and the national average. It does not explore other factors that could influence the support or opposition to impeachment, such as political affiliation, media influence, or specific local issues in swing states.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are national polls showing a majority of Americans supporting the impeachment inquiry and the removal of President Trump from office. It presents a skewed perspective by focusing solely on swing state polls that show opposition to impeachment.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that \"people don't want anything to do with impeachment\" by generalizing the sentiment based on swing state polls. It ignores the fact that there is a significant portion of the population supporting impeachment and removal, as shown by national polls."}
