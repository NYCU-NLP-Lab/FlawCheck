{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by stating that the governor paid his campaign staffers \"not with money, but with American Express gift cards.\" While it is true that some campaign workers were paid with gift cards, it is unclear if this was the case for all workers or if it was a common practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the governor paid all campaign staffers with American Express gift cards. The information provided only mentions one campaign worker who received gift cards instead of cash.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that paying campaign staffers with gift cards instead of cash is inherently problematic or unusual. However, it is not uncommon for campaigns to use various methods of compensation for their workers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why some campaign workers were paid with gift cards. It is possible that this was a logistical or financial decision made by the campaign or the Republican Party of Florida, rather than a deliberate choice by the governor."}
