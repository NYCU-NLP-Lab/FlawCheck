{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the petition seeking to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election by stating that the U.S. Supreme Court is deliberating on it, when in reality it was a longshot legal petition with minimal chances of being heard or decided favorably.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the U.S. Supreme Court is actually deliberating on the petition. It only mentions the existence of the petition and some details about it but does not provide concrete evidence of the court's involvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the petition seeking to overturn the election results is based on valid grounds of Russian interference. However, it does not provide enough information or evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the information it references is long outdated. This suggests that the claim is not based on the most up-to-date and accurate information.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing conflicting information about the chances of the petition being heard or decided favorably. It initially mentions that the petition has a 1% chance of being heard, but later states that it was mistakenly spread as if the Supreme Court would definitely consider nullifying the election results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the petition seeking to overturn the election results. It only focuses on the alleged Russian interference as the basis for the petition, without exploring other possible reasons or motivations behind it.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance or impact of the petition seeking to overturn the election results. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential consequences or implications of such a petition, if it were to be heard and decided favorably."}
