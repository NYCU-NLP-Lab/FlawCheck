{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the influence of super PACs by emphasizing the large amount of money raised and implying that it is primarily coming from a small number of wealthy individuals and corporations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific sources or data to support the statement that \"roughly half\" of the $180 million raised by super PACs came from fewer than 200 super-rich people and \"roughly 20 percent\" came from corporations. It only mentions that the information was obtained from articles in Politico and Roll Call.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the influence of super PACs is negative and that they skew American politics by giving outsize influence to wealthy donors. This assumption may be subjective and open to debate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funding of super PACs or the influence they have on politics. It presents the perspective that wealthy donors and corporations are the primary contributors, but it does not explore other possible sources of funding or factors influencing their influence."}
