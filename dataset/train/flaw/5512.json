{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the US has trade surpluses with each of the 20 countries is not supported by the evidence provided. The evidence shows that the US has trade deficits with several of its agreement partners.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the US has trade deficits with seven of its agreement partners, as shown by Census Bureau records.", "Understate": "The claim understates the trade deficits that the US has with some of its agreement partners. The evidence provided shows deficits ranging from millions to billions of dollars.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having trade agreements automatically leads to trade surpluses, which is not necessarily true. The evidence provided shows that the US has trade deficits with some of its agreement partners.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The evidence provided suggests that the US trade deficits with some of its agreement partners may be due to factors such as cheaper labor in those countries, as claimed by Donald Trump."}
