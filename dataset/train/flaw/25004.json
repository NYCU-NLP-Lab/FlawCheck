{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerating the situation by stating that the South African Police Service kills three times more people per capita than the United States police force. This is because the claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support this comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing specific data, statistics, or sources to back up the statement. It does not provide any information on the number of people killed by the United States police force per capita, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people killed by the South African Police Service is directly comparable to the number of people killed by the United States police force. However, it fails to consider other factors such as crime rates, population size, and socio-political contexts that may influence the comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in the number of people killed by the two police forces. It does not explore factors such as crime rates, policing strategies, or societal factors that may contribute to the disparity.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by providing unrelated information about Africa Check's values, privacy policy, and support for independent fact-checking. These statements do not contribute to the evaluation of the claim and may distract from the main argument.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting facts in the claim."}
