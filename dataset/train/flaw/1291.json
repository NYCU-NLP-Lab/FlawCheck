{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people that President Obama added to the government workforce. The actual number is 140,100, not 135,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully understand the context and breakdown of the increase in government workforce. The expert provides additional information and data to provide a more accurate picture.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hiring bureaucrats is a negative thing, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations for the increase in government workforce, such as growth in the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice. This suggests that the claim may not consider other factors contributing to the increase."}
