{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the growth rate by stating that it went up to 11% per annum in some years. The expert's verdict mentions that the growth rate was not always above 6.3%, indicating that the claim may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any supporting evidence or data to prove the statement about the growth rate. The expert's verdict mentions that the statistics came from various sources, but it does not specify if there is enough evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth rate mentioned (up to 11% per annum) applies to the entire period since 1986. The expert's verdict mentions that there were exceptions in the years 1986/87 and 2012/13 where the growth rate was not above 6.3%.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that historical data on Uganda's economy from 1986 and earlier could be sourced from global institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. This suggests that there may be alternative sources of data that could provide a different perspective on the growth rate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact mentioned in the expert's verdict that in at least 12 other financial years, GDP growth was below 6.3%. This contradicts the claim that the growth rate always went up to 11% per annum in some years."}
