{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of money sent to the border of Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger recon teams. The expert's verdict mentions that Perry's campaign and state office provided budget figures indicating that he signed into law nearly $415 million in spending on border security, which covers a longer period of time and includes various aspects of border security, not just the Texas Ranger recon teams.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the specific amount of money mentioned ($400 million) and how it was allocated specifically to the Texas Ranger recon teams. The expert's verdict mentions that more details were hard to come by, and the Department of Public Safety declined to share mission reports.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it is not consistently clear whether the $400 million mentioned is solely for the Texas Ranger recon teams or if it includes other aspects of border security. The expert's verdict mentions that sometimes Perry broadens the amount to \"a total of $400 million of state security operations,\" which suggests that the claim may not be consistently accurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $400 million sent to the border of Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger recon teams is solely responsible for addressing border security issues. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Perry described the recon teams as filling gaps left by the federal government's failure to secure the border adequately, suggesting that there are other factors and efforts involved in border security.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of the $400 million. The expert's verdict mentions that the budget figures provided cover a longer period of time and include various aspects of border security, indicating that the money may not be solely allocated to the Texas Ranger recon teams."}
