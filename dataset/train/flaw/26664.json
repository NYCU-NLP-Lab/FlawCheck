{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that the violence in Chicago attracted relatively little press coverage.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of press coverage the violence in Chicago received, as the expert's verdict mentions that the story did garner substantial news coverage, including reporting by the Associated Press and national news publications.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of press coverage for the violence in Chicago is unusual or unexpected. However, the expert's verdict explains that news outlets do not typically re-report events from the past unless there is substantial new activity related to them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the perceived lack of press coverage, such as the timing of the events or other major news stories that may have been prioritized by the media.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the violence in Chicago did receive news coverage, as mentioned by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the violence in Chicago attracted relatively little press coverage, as it does not provide any comparison or context for what would be considered \"little\" coverage.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence of the claim faltering at times, as the expert's verdict does not mention any inconsistencies or inconsistencies in the claim itself."}
