{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support as it falsely attributes a message to Dave Ramsey, who clarified that he had nothing to do with it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a cashless society would eliminate certain activities, such as odd jobs or selling used items, which is not necessarily true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for businesses going cashless, suggesting it may be due to a desire to appear cutting edge or because sales using plastic are higher.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Dave Ramsey did not write the warning about a cashless society.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Dave Ramsey's opinion on a cashless society, as he stated that it is not a topic that causes him much worry and considers the whole scenario to be kind of silly."}
