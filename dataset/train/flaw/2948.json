{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of not expanding Medicaid on rural hospitals by stating that a minimum of 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in those states. The expert's verdict states that the article in Governing did not estimate such a high percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in states that don't expand Medicaid. The expert's verdict mentions that the article in Governing did not provide such an estimate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between not expanding Medicaid and rural hospitals closing. The expert's verdict mentions that the article in Governing did not estimate hospital closures specifically due to not expanding Medicaid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential closure of rural hospitals, such as other financial factors or changes in healthcare policies. The expert's verdict suggests that the reduction of federal payments to hospitals treating uninsured patients may also contribute to the financial challenges faced by hospitals."}
