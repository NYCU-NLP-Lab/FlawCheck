{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Tom Brady actually made the statement about the NBA finals being rigged and referees taking bribes. The provided sources mention a Facebook page and a sports satire Instagram page, but there is no credible source or direct quote from Tom Brady himself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Tom Brady has faced accusations of game rigging in the past (specifically in the NFL), he would make similar accusations about the NBA finals. However, this assumption is not supported by any concrete evidence or statements from Brady.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for controversial calls or perceived biases in the NBA finals. It immediately jumps to the conclusion of rigging and bribery without exploring other factors such as human error, referee judgment, or strategic gameplay.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the provided quote is not genuine and is instead a creation of a sports satire Instagram page. This undermines the credibility of the claim and suggests that it may be exaggerating or misrepresenting the situation.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the alleged rigging and bribery in the NBA finals by stating that \"how many favorable calls are going to 'coincidentally' go the Warriors way in crucial games?\" This statement implies a significant bias towards the Warriors without providing substantial evidence to support it.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any bias being understated in the claim."}
