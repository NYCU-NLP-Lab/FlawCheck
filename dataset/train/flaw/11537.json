{"Understate": "The claim may understate Michelle Nunn's position on higher taxes, as her campaign website states that \"reform shouldn't raise taxes\" but does not explicitly deny supporting higher taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully prove that Michelle Nunn supports higher taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting Obamacare automatically means supporting higher taxes, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Michelle Nunn's statements, such as wanting changes to the tax code that are revenue-neutral rather than supporting outright tax increases."}
