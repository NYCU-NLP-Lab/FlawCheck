{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decrease in the buying power of Pell Grants over time. The expert's verdict states that the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college in the 2009-10 school year, while the claim states that it covers 34 percent today. This suggests that the claim may be slightly understating the current percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that a full Pell Grant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance in 1976 and covers 34 percent today. It relies on a document from a left-leaning think tank and does not provide additional sources or data to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative factors that may have contributed to the decrease in the percentage of costs covered by Pell Grants. It assumes that the sole reason for the decrease is the lack of funding, without considering other factors such as increasing college costs or changes in eligibility criteria.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the percentage of costs covered by Pell Grants is solely due to changes in funding levels. It does not consider other factors that may have influenced the decrease, such as rising college costs or changes in the program's structure.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the current percentage of costs covered by Pell Grants. The expert's verdict suggests that there may be some discrepancy between the claim's statement of 34 percent coverage and the maximum grant amount reported by the U.S. Department of Education.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college in the 2009-10 school year, as reported by the U.S. Department of Education. This contradicts the claim's statement that a full Pell Grant covers just 34 percent of those costs today.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim. However, without additional data or sources, it is difficult to determine the extent of the decrease in the buying power of Pell Grants."}
