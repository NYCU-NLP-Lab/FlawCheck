{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Rick Perry \"advocated to liquidate\" the state's rainy day fund, which implies a strong and direct endorsement of this action.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Rick Perry advocated for liquidating the rainy day fund.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that advocating to liquidate the fund is a negative action without providing further context or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or reasons for Rick Perry's past positions on the rainy day fund that are not explored in the claim."}
