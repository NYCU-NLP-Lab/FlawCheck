{"Understate": "The claim understates the potential threat posed by nationals from the seven countries included in President Trump's U.S. entry restriction by only considering lethal terrorist attacks and not non-lethal attacks or other terrorist activity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only presents data from 1975 to support its argument, which may not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about the current threat level.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the lack of lethal attacks by nationals from the seven countries, such as effective counterterrorism measures or other factors not considered in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the executive order did not specify the countries it referred to, but the Department of Homeland Security identified them as Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effectiveness of the U.S. entry restriction by implying that it is solely responsible for the absence of lethal attacks by nationals from the seven countries since 1975.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of lethal attacks by nationals from the seven countries justifies the U.S. entry restriction, without considering other factors or potential consequences of the policy.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information from different sources and not providing a comprehensive analysis of the data."}
