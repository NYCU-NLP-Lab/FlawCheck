{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the sentiment of small-business owners by stating that 74 percent believe Obamacare is a bad idea, when the survey actually found that 74 percent would find ways to avoid the employer mandate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclude that 74 percent of small-business owners believe Obamacare is a bad idea, as the survey only focused on the impact of the employer mandate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that finding ways to avoid the employer mandate equates to believing the entire health care law is a bad idea, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for small-business owners wanting to avoid the employer mandate, such as financial concerns or logistical challenges, which are not addressed in the claim."}
