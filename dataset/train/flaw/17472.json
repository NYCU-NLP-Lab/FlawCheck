{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that the ratio of people working for the government and working in manufacturing is an \"almost exact reversal\" of the situation in 1960. While the numbers provided by the expert support the claim, the alternative explanation suggests that the proportion of government employment has increased, but not to the extent of being an exact reversal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide additional evidence or data to substantiate the statement beyond the numbers provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ratio of people working for the government and working in manufacturing is the sole factor contributing to the financial struggles of states. It overlooks other potential factors that could impact state finances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation provided by the expert suggests that when considering the share of total U.S. employment, the proportion of government employment has increased while manufacturing employment has decreased. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of an \"almost exact reversal.\"", "Contradict fact": "There is no contradiction of fact found in the claim. The numbers provided by the expert support the claim's statement about the ratio of government employment and manufacturing employment in 1960 and 2011.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim faltering at times."}
