{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which produce in California, specifically tangerines, is being grown in toxic wastewater from oil company fracking activities. While the expert's verdict confirms that some crops in Kern County are irrigated with wastewater, the claim does not provide evidence to support the extent of this practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that produce in California, particularly tangerines, is being grown in toxic wastewater from oil company fracking activities. The expert's verdict mentions that crops in Kern County are irrigated with wastewater, but it does not specifically mention tangerines or provide extensive data on the scale of this practice.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wastewater used for irrigation is toxic and contains harmful pollutants from fracking activities. While the expert's verdict mentions that the wastewater used for irrigation comes from oil company activities, it does not explicitly state that it is toxic or contains harmful pollutants. The claim makes an assumption without providing concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the wastewater used for irrigation in Kern County is treated and tested to ensure it is safe for agricultural use. The claim does not consider this possibility and presents the assumption that the wastewater is toxic without exploring other explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the issue. It focuses specifically on tangerines and does not consider other crops or regions in California where similar practices may occur. The claim also lacks specific data or evidence to support its assertions, which weakens its overall argument.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential risks and impacts of using wastewater from fracking activities for irrigation. While the expert's verdict does not explicitly state the level of toxicity or harm in the wastewater, it does mention that the water has not been tested for safety. This suggests that there could be potential risks associated with using this water for irrigation that the claim does not fully address."}
