{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the presence of Democrat campaign donors on Mueller's team by using the phrase \"at a very high level.\" The evidence provided does not specify the number or level of Democrat campaign donors on the team.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Democrat campaign donors on Mueller's team automatically indicates partisan bias. However, the evidence does not provide sufficient support to conclude that their political affiliations would influence their work on the investigation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Mueller's team consists of Democrat campaign donors at a high level. The evidence provided only mentions concerns raised by a Republican congressman and does not provide specific information about the political affiliations of the lawyers on Mueller's team.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim suggests that the presence of Democrat campaign donors on Mueller's team may indicate bias, there could be alternative explanations for their inclusion, such as their expertise or qualifications in handling complex investigations. The evidence does not explore these alternative explanations."}
