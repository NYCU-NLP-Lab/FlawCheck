{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the Republican tax bill is \"not being scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as it is traditionally\" lacks enough support. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the Joint Committee on Taxation is responsible for scoring tax bills and has indeed scored versions of both the House and Senate bills.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the lack of scoring by the Congressional Budget Office is unusual or concerning. The expert's verdict explains that tax bills are traditionally scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, not the Congressional Budget Office.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the Joint Committee on Taxation, not the Congressional Budget Office, is responsible for scoring tax bills. The expert's verdict provides this alternative explanation and clarifies the role of the Joint Committee on Taxation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that the Joint Committee on Taxation has already scored versions of both the House and Senate bills. The expert's verdict highlights that the joint committee is the official scorekeeper for tax legislation and has provided analyses of the bill's revenue impact and its effects on different income segments.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Joint Committee on Taxation has indeed scored versions of the tax bill. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the joint committee has already published analyses of the bill's impact.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the Congressional Budget Office's role in scoring tax bills. The expert's verdict clarifies that tax bills are traditionally scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Congressional Budget Office's analysis is based heavily on the joint committee's work.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by overlooking the fact that the Joint Committee on Taxation has scored versions of the tax bill. The expert's verdict highlights the joint committee's role as the official scorekeeper for tax legislation."}
