{"Exaggerate": "There is a possibility of exaggeration in the claim as it states that every allegation made by Patrick Morrisey against Evan Jenkins was found to be false by PolitiFact. It is unclear if every single allegation made by Morrisey was actually fact-checked by PolitiFact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or references to the PolitiFact fact-checks that supposedly debunked the allegations made by Morrisey. It is therefore difficult to determine the accuracy and validity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that PolitiFact's fact-checks are completely unbiased and accurate. However, without specific evidence or references to the fact-checks in question, it is difficult to assess the reliability of PolitiFact's verdicts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the alleged fact-checks by PolitiFact. Without access to the specific fact-checks referenced in the claim, it is hard to determine if there are alternative explanations for the alleged false allegations made by Morrisey."}
