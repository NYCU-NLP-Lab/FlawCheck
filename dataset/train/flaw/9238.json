{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Bill Nelson \"doesn\u2019t pay payroll taxes for his employees\" and \"doesn\u2019t even provide them with health benefits.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the claim is referring to consultants, not employees, and that it is common for campaigns to rely on consultants early on.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Bill Nelson is avoiding payroll taxes and stealing money from Medicare and Social Security. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the Nelson campaign did not have any full-time staff to pay taxes on and that consultants are not required to have payroll taxes paid or receive health benefits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that not paying payroll taxes and not providing health benefits to consultants is equivalent to stealing money from Medicare and Social Security. The expert's verdict does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the Nelson campaign did not have full-time staff and relied on consultants. The expert's verdict suggests that hiring consultants is relatively common, especially for incumbent politicians, and that consultants are often used for fundraising, polling, and early campaign efforts."}
