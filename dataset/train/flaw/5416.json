{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the actions of the Ohio 'Oath Keepers' group by stating that they tried to charge a woman and her son to walk through a shopping mall during an event. The expert's verdict suggests that the group initially allowed the woman to walk through the venue unattended, but later asked her to pay the entry fee or be escorted through the venue.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Ohio 'Oath Keepers' group's behavior was insulting and unnecessary, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict includes conflicting accounts of the incident, with the group's representative denying the claim and providing their own version of events.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a letter written by a Bowling Green woman, but there is no additional evidence or sources provided to support her account. The expert's verdict includes conflicting accounts and statements from both parties involved, making it difficult to determine the veracity of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the incident, suggesting that the Ohio 'Oath Keepers' group may have asked the woman to pay the entry fee or be escorted through the venue because it was a closed charity event and she was seen inside the venue without an armband."}
