{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the distance that someone would have to drive for cervical cancer screening if the Texas abortion measure passes. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim states someone would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio, but there may be other clinics open for these screenings in El Paso.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that someone would have to drive 550 miles each way for cervical cancer screening. The expert's verdict mentions that there are two El Paso clinics that could potentially close, but it is unclear if there are alternative clinics or options for screenings in the area.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if the measure passes, there will be no clinics in El Paso that provide cervical cancer screenings. The expert's verdict mentions that the chairman's reference to San Antonio was not intended to imply that no El Paso facility would provide such services, and there may be other clinics open in El Paso.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative clinics or options for cervical cancer screenings in El Paso. The expert's verdict mentions that there may be other clinics open in El Paso that provide these services, but the claim does not acknowledge this possibility.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the potential impact of the Texas abortion measure on cervical cancer screening access. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim could have been clearer and that there may be other clinics open in El Paso, indicating that the claim may not fully capture the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of the Texas abortion measure on cervical cancer screening access. The expert's verdict mentions that two El Paso clinics could potentially close if the measure passes, but it does not provide further information on the availability of alternative clinics or options for screenings in the area."}
