{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the pay increase by stating it as 63 percent, without providing specific evidence of the exact increase for Jessica King.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Jessica King voted for the pay increase, as it only provides evidence of the overall increase in pay for city council members.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a pay increase for city council members automatically translates to a pay increase for Jessica King, without providing specific evidence of her individual raise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the King campaign spokesperson, stating that Jessica King voted against the pay raise and advocated for a citizen committee to review salaries. This alternative explanation challenges the claim made by the Hopper campaign."}
