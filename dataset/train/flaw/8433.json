{"Contradict fact": "The claim that players on the Philadelphia Eagles knelt in protest during the National Anthem throughout the 2017 regular NFL season contradicts the expert's verdict that the team actually stood during the anthem throughout the season and playoffs.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent of the protests by stating that all players on the team knelt, while the expert's verdict indicates that only one player, Ron Brooks, knelt during at least one pre-season game.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that players on the Philadelphia Eagles knelt in protest throughout the entire 2017 season.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all players on the team took part in the protests, which is not supported by the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the protests were in response to police brutality and social inequality, rather than being unpatriotic as some have claimed."}
