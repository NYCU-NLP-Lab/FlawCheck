{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Attorney General Eric Holder's involvement in the dismissal of the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation. The claim suggests that Holder is directly involved, but it does not provide enough evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges. It merely presents opinions and statements from Fox News pundits without providing concrete evidence or official statements from Holder himself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the dismissal of the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation is solely due to the Obama administration's lack of willingness to go after minorities for civil rights violations. This assumption may oversimplify the complex decision-making process and motivations behind the dismissal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or acknowledge any alternative explanations for the dismissal of the criminal charges. It solely focuses on the Obama administration's alleged bias and does not consider other potential factors or reasons for the decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Department of Justice filed a civil action in federal court accusing the New Black Panther Party members of engaging in voter intimidation. The claim suggests that the Department never pursued criminal charges, but it overlooks the fact that a civil action was filed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the video evidence and the potential impact it could have had on a criminal case. It suggests that the video alone should have been enough to pursue criminal charges, but it does not consider other legal factors or requirements for pursuing such charges.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting opinions and statements from Fox News pundits without providing a balanced perspective or counterarguments. It relies heavily on one side of the argument and does not thoroughly examine opposing viewpoints or additional evidence."}
