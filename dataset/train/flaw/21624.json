{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Sanders that the average American is not making a penny more than they did 45 years ago is an exaggeration, as it fails to consider the increase in real median family income over that time period.", "Contradict fact": "Sanders' claim contradicts the fact that real median family income in the United States has increased by nearly 29% over the last 45 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the assertion that the average American is not making any more money than they did 45 years ago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average American's income should have increased at the same rate as technology and worker productivity, without considering other factors that may have influenced income growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The increase in real median family income over the last 45 years could be attributed to various factors, such as economic growth, changes in labor market dynamics, and government policies, rather than solely blaming trade policies as Sanders suggests."}
