{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of American children trapped in failing government schools by using the term \"countless\" without providing any specific data or evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that \"tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list\" for school choice programs. No data or sources are provided to back up this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its support for the statement that Janiyah Davis was on a waiting list for an Opportunity Scholarship. The Philadelphia Inquirer and Associated Press investigations revealed a disconnect between the claim and the facts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that expanding school choice through Opportunity Scholarships is the only way to rescue American children trapped in failing government schools. It does not consider alternative solutions or approaches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the veto of legislation to expand school choice in Pennsylvania. It only presents the viewpoint that the governor's veto put Janiyah's future further out of reach without exploring other factors or perspectives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf did sign a budget in 2018 with a more modest increase for the Educational Improvement Tax Credit program, rather than completely vetoing legislation to expand school choice.", "Understate": "The claim understates the level of support for school choice programs by stating that only 18 states have created such programs. It does not provide information on the extent or impact of these programs in those states."}
