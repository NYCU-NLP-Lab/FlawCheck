{"Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton helped \"get done\" the Children's Health Insurance Program. The expert's verdict mentions that some claims related to her role in the program have been more careful in their wording about her role than others, indicating that there may be a lack of concrete evidence to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the late-Sen. Ted Kennedy and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch were also key figures in the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the program's success, and it may not solely be attributed to Hillary Clinton's efforts.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the role of Hillary Clinton in the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The expert's verdict includes statements from Kennedy and Littlefield, who emphasize her pivotal role in encouraging the White House to pursue the program. Therefore, the claim may not fully acknowledge the extent of her involvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton played a significant role in the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program. However, the expert's verdict mentions that she was not a legislator, did not write the law, and was not the president, indicating that her role may have been more indirect or supportive rather than directly responsible for its implementation.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear indication that the claim contradicts any established facts. However, the lack of sufficient evidence and alternative explanations mentioned in the expert's verdict may suggest that the claim could potentially contradict the fact that Hillary Clinton solely \"got done\" the Children's Health Insurance Program."}
