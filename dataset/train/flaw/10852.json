{"Exaggerate": "There is a possibility that the claim exaggerates the extent to which the corporate tax rate is the lowest since 1968. The data provided shows that the rate in 2009 was 7.1 percent, which is not significantly different from the current rate of 6.5 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of accurately representing the historical corporate tax rates in New York. While the claim suggests that the current rate is the lowest since 1968, the data provided indicates that the rate did not fall below 7 percent in later years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it is based on a single statement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo without additional evidence or data to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having the lowest corporate tax rate is a positive achievement without considering the potential consequences or impact on the state's revenue and services.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the claim, such as changes in the tax structure or the inclusion of surcharges in certain regions, as mentioned by E.J. McMahon. These factors may affect the overall comparison of corporate tax rates."}
