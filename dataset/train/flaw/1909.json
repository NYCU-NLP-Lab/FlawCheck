{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that a maulana beats a minor inside a madrasa in India. The only evidence provided is a viral video, but it is later revealed that the incident took place in Bangladesh.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident shown in the viral video is from India, without verifying the facts or confirming the location.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident actually took place in Bangladesh, not India.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the incident shown in the video is unrelated to the context of the temple incident and may have different circumstances.", "Understate": "The claim understates the importance of verifying information and fact-checking before sharing viral videos or news stories.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading headline and failing to provide accurate information about the location of the incident.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it primarily suffers from lack of support and problematic assumptions."}
