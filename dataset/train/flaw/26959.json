{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that all schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, when in reality, the length of school closures varies by province and territory.", "Understate": "The claim understates the duration of school closures in some provinces, such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland-Labrador, and New Brunswick, where schools are closed indefinitely.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that each family will receive $950 every two weeks, as a spokesperson for Canada's Minister of Finance refutes this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $950 payment applies to every family, which is not the case according to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) details provided by the expert.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim provides an alternative explanation for the school closures in Ontario, stating that the ministry of education is considering postponing the reopening date, rather than stating a definitive closure period."}
