{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership by stating that it \"knocks out 18,000 tariffs\" without providing enough context or considering the potential limitations and caveats of the tariff cuts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the Trans-Pacific Partnership eliminates 18,000 tariffs. The provided explanation and calculations are not thoroughly explained or backed by extensive data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the elimination of tariffs automatically benefits American businesses and workers without considering potential negative consequences or alternative perspectives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential benefits or drawbacks of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, such as the impact on specific industries or the potential for increased competition for American businesses.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 18,000 figure includes tariffs on American goods that are not currently exported, which means the actual number of tariffs affecting American products may be lower than stated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential economic effects of the tariff cuts and the overall impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership."}
