{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that the other candidates have each voted a billion dollars worth of votes to raise taxes, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the other candidates have raised taxes. The article mentions that the tax hikes were approved by a Republican-controlled Legislature and a Republican governor, suggesting that it was not solely the candidates' actions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting to raise taxes is inherently negative, without considering the context or reasons behind those votes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article provides an alternative explanation for the tax hikes, stating that they were an adjustment to restore the state's buying power lost to inflation and some considered it a user fee."}
