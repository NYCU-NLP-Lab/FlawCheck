{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Jeb Bush \"significantly cut early voting\" prior to the 2008 presidential election. The expert's verdict mentions that while Bush did sign a bill in 2005 that set new limits on early voting, he had also signed a bill in 2004 that allowed early voting and provided for a statewide maximum of 14 early voting days and at least eight hours of voting per day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jeb Bush's decision to cut early voting was specifically aimed at diminishing turnout in minority communities. However, the expert's verdict does not provide sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to quantify the extent of the early voting cuts made by Jeb Bush.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were reports of issues and lack of oversight at some early voting sites, which could have influenced the decision to cut early voting hours. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decision, beyond solely targeting minority communities.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately portraying the actions of Jeb Bush regarding early voting. The expert's verdict states that while Bush did sign a bill in 2005 that set new limits on early voting, he had also signed a bill in 2004 that allowed early voting.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the complexity of the issue. The expert's verdict mentions the 2004 law signed by Jeb Bush that allowed early voting and provided for a statewide maximum of 14 early voting days and at least eight hours of voting per day. This suggests that the claim's assertion of \"significantly\" cutting early voting may not fully capture the nuances of the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Jeb Bush did sign a bill in 2004 that allowed early voting, which is mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
