{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of Rep. Southerland's vote on the government shutdown, stating that it cost taxpayers $24 billion and hurt businesses, families, seniors, and veterans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Rep. Southerland \"voted to keep the shutdown going.\" It does not provide any specific instances or voting records to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. Southerland's vote for three House bills stripped of Obamacare funding prior to Oct. 1 is evidence that he did not support or vote for the government shutdown. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider other factors or motivations behind his vote.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Rep. Southerland's vote, such as his stance on Obamacare or other political considerations, which are not explored in the claim."}
