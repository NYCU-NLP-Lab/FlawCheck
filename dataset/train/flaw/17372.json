{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the CCTV footage does not have a time or date stamp to indicate when or where the blast took place. Additionally, a reverse image search shows that the video has been online since 2007, which contradicts the claim that it shows the Pulwama attack in 2019.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from 2007 and shows a blast in Iraq, not the Pulwama attack in Kashmir.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the footage is from a blast in Iraq and not related to the Pulwama attack in Kashmir.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the misinformation as it falsely attributes the footage to the Pulwama attack, potentially misleading viewers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the CCTV footage is related to the Pulwama attack without sufficient evidence or verification.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim as it presents the footage as evidence of a bomb attack in Kashmir, Pulwama.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and failing to provide accurate context or verification for the footage."}
