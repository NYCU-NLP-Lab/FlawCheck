The expert's verdict states that vaccination is not a ticket out of quarantine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the CDC can detain anyone with a fever, which is not entirely accurate. The expert's verdict clarifies the specific conditions under which quarantines can be implemented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a specific interpretation of the CDC's power to detain individuals, but the expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and clarifies the details of quarantines and isolation measures."}
