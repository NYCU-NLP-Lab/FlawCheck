{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the coins by suggesting that they were minted by the East India Company and have a connection to the construction of Lord Ram's temple.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or historical documentation to support the assertion that the coins were minted by the East India Company.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Lord Ram's image on the coin and the mention of the lotus flower and Diwali celebration in Ayodhya are proof of a connection to the construction of Lord Ram's temple, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of Lord Ram's image on the coin, such as religious or cultural symbolism, rather than a direct connection to the construction of a temple."}
