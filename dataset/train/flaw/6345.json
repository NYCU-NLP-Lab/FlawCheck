{"Understate": "The expert's verdict states that the questions in the meme have rational answers and fail to prove Biden's presidency is illegitimate. This suggests that the claim may be understating the evidence and arguments supporting Biden's presidency.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that USA TODAY has previously fact-checked claims that Biden illegally won the election and is an illegitimate president, and none were true. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support or evidence to back up its questioning of Biden's presidency.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that QAnon followers are looking for evidence to undercut Biden's presidency and allow QAnon prophecies to prevail. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption that QAnon prophecies are valid and Biden's presidency is illegitimate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Biden decided to fly to Washington for Inauguration Day instead of taking Amtrak due to ongoing threats of far-right extremism. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Biden's actions that are not related to the legitimacy of his presidency.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is false regarding the military band playing \"Hail to the Chief\" and Biden receiving a 21-gun salute. This suggests that the claim may contradict factual information."}
