{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Georgia has had the nation's busiest Court of Appeals for a decade or more lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The article only provides anecdotal statements from individuals without presenting any concrete statistics or comparative analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of cases handled by a court directly correlates with its busyness or workload. However, the article does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The article mentions that the Georgia Court of Appeals has a unique provision in the state constitution that mandates quick resolution of appeals within two court terms. This could potentially explain why the court appears busy, as cases are processed more rapidly compared to other courts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided in the article, which states that the Court of Appeals' caseload has been relatively steady in recent years and peaked in 1995. This contradicts the claim that the court has been the busiest for a decade or more.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the workload or busyness of other intermediate courts of appeals in the country. The article does not provide a comprehensive comparison or analysis of caseloads in other states, making it difficult to determine if Georgia truly has the busiest court.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and well-supported argument for Georgia having the busiest Court of Appeals. The article raises doubts about the claim's validity by highlighting the lack of public vetting and the added costs to taxpayers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Georgia's Court of Appeals being the busiest in the nation. The article does not provide any information on the potential impact or implications of this supposed distinction, making it unclear why it is relevant or important."}
