{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" caps are made in China lacks sufficient evidence to support it. There are conflicting reports and statements from different sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of Trump's campaign hats are made in China based on a comment made by State Rep. Celia Israel. However, there is evidence to suggest that the official campaign hats are made in the USA.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be knockoff versions of the hats that are made in China, while the official campaign hats are made in the USA."}
