{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the role of Charlie Crist in the passage of ObamaCare by stating that it \"all started\" with his support for the stimulus.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to establish a direct causal link between Charlie Crist's support for the stimulus and the passage of ObamaCare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Charlie Crist's support for the stimulus automatically translates into support for ObamaCare, without considering any potential differences or nuances in his position.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the passage of ObamaCare that do not solely rely on Charlie Crist's support for the stimulus, such as the actions and decisions of other politicians or factors beyond Crist's influence.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its attempt to establish a clear and direct connection between Charlie Crist's support for the stimulus and the passage of ObamaCare, as acknowledged by the expert's verdict."}
