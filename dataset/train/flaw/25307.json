{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that every single strawberry served to Members of Congress will have passed through the hands of an undocumented immigrant, which may not be true for all strawberries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that every single strawberry served to Members of Congress is handled by undocumented immigrants. The evidence provided only shows the prevalence of undocumented workers in the agricultural industry.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all strawberries served to Members of Congress are sourced from farms that employ undocumented immigrants, which may not be accurate as there are various sources and suppliers for strawberries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of strawberries served to Members of Congress, such as strawberries sourced from farms that employ documented workers or strawberries imported from other countries.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the involvement of undocumented workers in the strawberry industry, as the evidence provided suggests that a significant percentage of fruit and nut hired workers do not have work authorization.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it relies on statements made by a specific individual (Rep. Luis Gutierrez) and may not represent a comprehensive view of the strawberry industry as a whole.", "Contradicts fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim as the evidence provided supports the presence of undocumented workers in the agricultural industry, but it does not specifically address the claim itself."}
