{"Exaggerate": "The claim includes exaggerated language, such as \"insanity marches on\" and \"You cannot make this stuff up,\" which may be used to heighten emotions and create a sense of alarm.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photograph shows a Muslim TSA agent patting down a nun. The expert's verdict mentions that the assumption of the women's religious affiliations is based on their mode of dress and not verified by the photographer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that it is problematic or unusual for a Muslim TSA agent to be screening a nun, suggesting a bias against Muslims or a belief that their religious affiliation should disqualify them from certain roles.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the photograph, suggesting that it may not be related to the claims made about President Obama, Muslims, or national security. This suggests that there may be alternative interpretations or contexts for the image.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential reasons for additional screening of individuals wearing head coverings or loose garments, such as the nun's habit. The expert's verdict mentions that the TSA website states that people with such attire may undergo additional security screening, but the claim does not acknowledge this possibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph predates Barack Obama's election to the White House, indicating that it cannot be directly linked to \"Obama's America\" as suggested in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making assumptions about the religious affiliations of the individuals in the photograph without verified evidence. It also falters by connecting the photograph to political or religious narratives without sufficient support."}
