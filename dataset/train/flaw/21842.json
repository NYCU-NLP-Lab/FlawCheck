{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Crist that the economic turnaround started at the end of his term can be seen as an exaggeration because there is limited evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to back it up, as the data shows mixed results and does not definitively prove that the economic turnaround started at the end of Crist's term.", "Problematic assumption": "Crist assumes that the economic recovery was solely due to his acceptance of stimulus money and his actions as governor, without acknowledging other factors that may have contributed to the recovery.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The data suggests that the economic recovery may have been a result of actions taken by Crist's successor, Governor Scott, rather than solely attributable to Crist's term in office.", "Falters at times": "Crist's claim falters because the data shows a mixed picture of economic indicators during his term, with some improvements but also continued decline in certain areas.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that Crist is understating any facts or downplaying the impact of his actions on the economy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the economic recovery actually started during Scott's term as governor, rather than at the end of Crist's term."}
