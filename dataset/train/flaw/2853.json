{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Louis Cheskin's advice by stating that he advised McDonald's not to do away with the golden arches because they looked like \"mother McDonald's breasts.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Cheskin did suggest that customers would unconsciously associate the arches with a \"pair of nourishing breasts,\" but it is misleading to say that he advised McDonald's during the logo's creation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about Louis Cheskin's advice. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are references to Cheskin's association of the arches with \"Freudian implications in the subconscious mind\" and \"Mother McDonald's breasts\" in the July 1995 issue of Reader's Digest and a Tennessee daily newspaper.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Louis Cheskin's advice was the sole reason for McDonald's decision to keep the golden arches. However, the expert's verdict suggests that Cheskin's advice was one of the factors considered by McDonald's when they were considering abandoning the arches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for McDonald's decision to keep the golden arches or consider other factors that may have influenced their choice. The expert's verdict also does not provide alternative explanations, but it mentions that Cheskin's advice was not the only factor considered by McDonald's."}
