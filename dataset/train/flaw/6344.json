{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which the FBI \"didn't act\" when the gun store reported Mateen's attempted purchase of body armor and bulk ammunition. The expert's verdict suggests that the FBI did investigate Mateen in the past for terrorism ties, although the investigations were closed without taking action.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing enough context or information about the actions taken by the FBI in response to the gun store's report. The expert's verdict suggests that the FBI had limited options in dealing with individuals on a terrorist watch list who want to buy weapons or explosives.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that the FBI \"didn't act\" when the gun store reported Mateen's attempted purchase. The expert's verdict provides some information about the FBI's investigations and limitations, but more evidence may be needed to fully evaluate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may assume that the FBI's lack of immediate action in response to the gun store's report is evidence of their failure to act. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the FBI's options and procedures in dealing with individuals on a terrorist watch list may have contributed to the delay in taking action.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the FBI's actions or lack thereof. The expert's verdict suggests that the FBI's investigations of Mateen in the past, as well as their limitations in dealing with individuals on a terrorist watch list, may have influenced their response to the gun store's report."}
