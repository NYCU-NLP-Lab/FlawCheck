The expert's verdict highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the circumstances surrounding the team's footwear choices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for why the Indian football team played barefoot at the 1948 Olympics.
