{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that a \"large majority\" of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim and not U.S.-born. The expert requested documentation from the speaker but received none. Only vague references to \"numerous publications and blogs\" were provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the beliefs of a \"large majority\" of Republicans can be accurately determined without providing any specific data or sources. This assumption is problematic as it lacks concrete evidence.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the percentage of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim and not U.S.-born. The expert mentions polls conducted in different states and national polls that indicate varying percentages. However, without specific data, it is difficult to determine the actual extent of this belief among Republicans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the beliefs of Republicans. It assumes that these beliefs are solely based on misinformation or bias, without considering other factors that may contribute to these beliefs, such as political ideology or disagreement with Obama's policies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that multiple polls have been conducted on this topic, which have shown varying percentages of Republicans holding these beliefs. The claim presents a blanket statement about the beliefs of a \"large majority\" without acknowledging the diversity of opinions within the Republican Party.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing consistent and reliable evidence to support the assertion. The expert mentions polls conducted in different contexts and states, which may not provide a comprehensive picture of the beliefs of Republicans as a whole.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the extent of the belief among Republicans. While some polls have shown a significant percentage of Republicans holding these beliefs, it is unclear if it can be generalized to a \"large majority\" without more specific and comprehensive data."}
