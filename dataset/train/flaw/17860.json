{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the claim that the photograph shows an \"inflatable dam\" holding back flood waters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the dam in the photograph is inflatable, which is not supported by the expert's verdict. The expert states that the dam is actually filled with water, not air.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the dam in the photograph is not inflatable but filled with water.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the use of the term \"inflatable\" to describe the dam, as it is not accurate.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanations being presented in the claim."}
