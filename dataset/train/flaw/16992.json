{"Exaggerate": "The claim includes strong language and vivid descriptions of the practice, such as \"stray dogs being skewered on hooks and dragged behind boats as live shark bait\" and \"other dogs and kittens have been chomped up and swallowed by sharks.\"", "Understate": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or statistics to support the extent of the practice or the number of animals affected. It only mentions a single incident involving a six-month-old labrador pup.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to back up the allegations. It mentions that the RSPCA plans to petition the French government and includes a petition link, but there is no additional information or data provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of live dogs as bait for shark-fishing is a widespread and accepted practice on R\u00e9union Island, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or perspectives for the alleged practice. It does not explore whether this practice is culturally accepted or if there are any regulations or enforcement measures in place to address animal cruelty."}
