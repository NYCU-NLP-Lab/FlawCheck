{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Bernie Sanders' voting record on Trump's defense budgets by stating that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to have voted against all of them, when in fact there is another candidate, Tulsi Gabbard, who has also voted against all three of Trump's defense authorization bills.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Sanders' campaign did not provide evidence to support the claim that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to have voted against all of Trump's defense budgets.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against defense budgets is a positive attribute, without providing any explanation or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict highlights the existence of another candidate, Tulsi Gabbard, who has also voted against all of Trump's defense budgets, providing an alternative explanation to Sanders' claim of being the only candidate to do so.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bernie Sanders did not vote on the recent defense spending bill that he publicly opposed, therefore he cannot claim to have voted against it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by stating that Bernie Sanders has voted against all of Trump's defense budgets, when in reality he has missed some votes and has not voted against all of them.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim."}
