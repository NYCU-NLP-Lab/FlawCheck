{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the funding gap between the prison system and the University of Wisconsin System by stating it as a \"dubious distinction\" and framing it as the first time in the state's history.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or figures to support the comparison between prison system spending and university spending in 2011.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the funding allocation between the prison system and the University of Wisconsin System is solely determined by the governor's budget decisions, ignoring the influence of policy changes made under previous Republican and Democratic governors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the funding gap between the two agencies was the result of years of policy changes made under both Republican and Democratic governors prior to Scott Walker, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the disparity in funding.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the funding gap between the prison system and the University of Wisconsin System had been narrowing in the four budgets before Scott Walker's tenure as governor."}
