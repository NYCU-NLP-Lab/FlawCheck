{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no recent media report about a Jain monk fasting unto death against cow slaughter in India. It also states that the images of the viral picture and the Jain monk mentioned in a 2011 article do not match.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the emaciated man in the photograph is a Jain monk fasting unto death to stop cow slaughter in India. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the photograph resembles the ancient Jain religious ritual of Sallekhana/Santhara, which is not common in Jainism and is only undertaken by monks, nuns, and lay followers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, suggesting that the person in the viral picture is practicing the ancient Jain ritual of Sallekhana/Santhara, rather than fasting unto death to stop cow slaughter in India."}
