{"Lack enough support": "The claim that President Trump wrote personal checks to tornado victims in Nashville, Tennessee lacks evidence or any news articles, videos, or photographs to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that no other president in history has ever written personal checks to disaster victims, which is a problematic assumption as it is not supported by any evidence or comparison to other presidents' actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that Trump had his \"personal accountant\" with him during the visit, but there is no mention of an accountant accompanying him on the trip. The claim's reference to Trump's \"personal accountant\" likely refers to Allen Weisselberg, who did not accompany Trump on this trip.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that Trump flew into the area in a helicopter, but he actually traveled to Nashville via Air Force One.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Trump wrote personal checks to all those in need, without any evidence to support this.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to support the claim, and it understates the lack of proof by presenting it as a rumor on Facebook rather than a verified fact.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of accuracy and reliability by using a photograph from a different event in Alabama in 2019 to support the claim about Trump writing personal checks in Nashville in 2020."}
