{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the content of the emails by stating that they explicitly discussed \"the location of Ambassador Stevens.\" The emails mentioned in the expert's verdict only refer to Stevens' whereabouts in general terms and do not provide specific details.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton discussed the location of Ambassador Stevens in the released emails. The expert's verdict mentions that there are only six possibly relevant emails, and they do not provide concrete evidence of discussing Stevens' location.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that discussing Stevens' location in the emails automatically implies the transmission of classified information. However, the expert's verdict does not explicitly state that the information discussed in the emails was classified.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the information about Stevens' location in the emails is similar to what was publicly shared in the media at the time. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the emails contained exclusive or classified information.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by presenting a misleading or exaggerated interpretation of the contents of the emails. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced understanding of the emails, indicating that they discuss Stevens' location in general terms rather than specific details.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the complexity of the issue by simplifying it to a single statement about discussing Stevens' location. The expert's verdict delves deeper into the context, timing, and content of the emails, providing a more comprehensive analysis."}
