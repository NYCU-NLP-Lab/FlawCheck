{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that health insurance premiums have increased by \"more than 105 percent\" since 2013. The expert's verdict confirms that premiums have indeed increased, but it does not provide evidence to support the specific percentage mentioned in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the assertion that premiums have increased by over 105 percent since 2013. The expert's verdict mentions a report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and eHealth, but it does not directly link these sources to the specific percentage mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in health insurance premiums is solely due to the Obamacare law. While the expert's verdict confirms that premiums have increased, it does not explicitly state that the increase is solely attributable to the Obamacare law. There may be other factors contributing to the rise in premiums.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that premiums have increased by exactly 105 percent since 2013. The expert's verdict confirms that premiums have increased but does not provide evidence to support the specific percentage mentioned in the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the increase in health insurance premiums. The expert's verdict and the information provided support the notion that premiums have indeed increased.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times. The expert's verdict and the information provided support the claim that premiums have increased.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the increase in health insurance premiums. The expert's verdict does not provide alternative explanations either."}
