{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single leaked email without providing further evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the compilation of a list of potential Muslim and Asian-American candidates for cabinet posts automatically means that non-Muslims were excluded from consideration for top posts, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the list by suggesting that it was a deliberate effort to hire only Muslim people for administration cabinet positions, when in fact, it was a compilation of potential candidates from specific demographic groups.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting the story as if it were new and relevant in 2019, when it was originally published in 2016 and lacked timely relevance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore the possibility that lists of candidates from other demographic groups were also compiled to promote general diversity in the Obama administration's ranks, suggesting alternative explanations for the compilation of the list."}
