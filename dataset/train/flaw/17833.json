{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the video by stating that an audience member scared Donald Trump at a rally by screaming \"Allahu Akbar.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the audio in the video was manipulated to create this false impression.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video accurately represents an audience member scaring Donald Trump, but the expert's verdict reveals that it was a protester who rushed the stage, not an audience member, and the audio was manipulated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the incident, such as the protester's motive or intentions, which the expert's verdict provides by quoting the protester's statement denying any intention to attack Trump."}
