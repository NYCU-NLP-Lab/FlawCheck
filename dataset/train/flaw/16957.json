{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh, while the expert's verdict clarifies that she actually won 75% of the vote. This indicates an exaggeration in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. It is not clear where this information came from, which suggests a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the percentage of votes received by Hillary Clinton in Pittsburgh is relevant to the discussion about the Paris climate agreement. This assumption may be problematic as it does not directly address the issue at hand.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that President Trump invoked the city of Pittsburgh to justify his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim made by Pittsburgh's mayor, such as using the vote percentage to counter Trump's argument."}
