{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the angle at which the Boeing 737 Max plane takes off, suggesting it is at a 90-degree angle.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the steep takeoff shown in the video is a popular stunt at airshows and not a regular occurrence during commercial flights.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or specific information about the maximum angle the plane reached in the video.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video accurately represents the plane taking off at a 90-degree angle, without considering the possibility of camera perspective and angle.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the steep takeoff is a result of camera perspective and angle, rather than the actual angle at which the plane is taking off."}
