{"Contradict fact": "The claim that President Trump cancelled Michelle Obama's school lunch program is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the program was not cancelled but rather some of the nutritional guidelines were relaxed.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the changes made by the Trump administration to the school lunch program by implying a complete cancellation when only some guidelines were rolled back.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that President Trump cancelled Michelle Obama's school lunch program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Michelle Obama had a specific school lunch program that was cancelled by President Trump, when in reality she was an advocate for healthier lifestyles and pushed for better nutritional standards as part of the \"Let's Move\" initiative.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the Trump administration rolled back some of the nutritional guidelines for school lunches set by the Obama-era legislation, rather than cancelling the program entirely."}
