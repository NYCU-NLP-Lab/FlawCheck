{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Diahann Carroll publicly praised and defended President Donald Trump and pleaded with Democrats to end their criticism of him. There is no evidence of any television appearance or interview by Carroll during the stated period, and no evidence of any kind that Carroll made the specific statements mentioned in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Diahann Carroll made the statements attributed to her in the meme without providing concrete evidence or verification. It is problematic to accept the statements as true without sufficient proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is a possibility that the meme and the attributed statements were fabricated or falsely attributed to Diahann Carroll. Without further evidence, it is reasonable to consider alternative explanations for the origin and authenticity of the statements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence of Diahann Carroll publicly praising and defending President Donald Trump or pleading with Democrats to end their criticism of him. The lack of supporting evidence contradicts the claim's assertion.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of Diahann Carroll's support for President Donald Trump by stating that she \"pleaded\" with Democrats to end their criticism. Without evidence, it is difficult to determine the true extent of Carroll's views or actions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a meme and blog posts from disreputable sources as the main evidence for Carroll's alleged statements. The lack of credible sources weakens the claim's credibility.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the lack of evidence and credibility behind the attributed statements. It does not fully address the fact that there is no verifiable proof of Carroll making the specific statements mentioned in the claim."}
