{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau transferred control of the Canadian border to the United Nations. The expert's verdict clarifies that the agreement signed by Trudeau does not usurp control of national borders and instead respects sovereignty and each nation's control of their own international boundaries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the signing of the UN Global Compact on Migration by Trudeau means a betrayal of Canadian sovereignty. However, the expert's verdict explains that the agreement upholds the sovereignty of states and their obligations under international law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Trudeau's actions will lead to the silencing of critical speech or the wiping out of Canada's borders. The expert's verdict provides a counter-argument based on the content of the agreement itself.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the UN Global Compact on Migration does not transfer control of national borders to the United Nations. The expert's verdict provides evidence from the agreement itself that reaffirms the sovereign right of states to determine their national migration policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided perspective by portraying Trudeau's actions as a betrayal and a step towards a 'post-national state.' The expert's verdict offers an alternative explanation by providing the content of the agreement and highlighting its emphasis on cooperation, sovereignty, and international law."}
