The expert's verdict provides a timeline and statements from Casten and his campaign that contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Casten demanded impeachment before the release of the Mueller report, without providing any evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Casten did not publicly support impeachment until after the release of the report.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Casten's actions and assumes that his support for impeachment was solely based on partisan politics.

The expert's verdict provides evidence and statements from Casten and his campaign that contradict the claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the timeline of Casten's support for impeachment by suggesting that he demanded impeachment before the release of the Mueller report.

The expert's verdict provides a more detailed analysis of the timeline and statements from Casten and his campaign to clarify the situation."}
