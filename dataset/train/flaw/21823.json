{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Rick Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships in half, when in reality it refers to the number of scholarships distributed, not the total dollars spent or the amount of individual scholarships.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Rick Scott actually cut Bright Futures scholarships in half. The evidence provided only shows that the number of scholarships distributed decreased due to higher eligibility requirements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the number of scholarships distributed is solely due to Rick Scott's actions, without considering the role of the Legislature and the previous governor, Charlie Crist, in implementing higher eligibility requirements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the decrease in the number of scholarships distributed, which is the implementation of higher eligibility requirements by both the Legislature and the previous governor, Charlie Crist."}
