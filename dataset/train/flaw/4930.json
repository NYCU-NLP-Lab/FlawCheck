{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual risk posed by the radioactive salmon found in British Columbia by emphasizing that the radiation levels were low and below government exposure risk metrics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the radioactive salmon pose a risk to human health. The expert's verdict mentions that only one salmon specimen tested positive for Fukushima radiation, and the radiation levels were low.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of radioactive salmon in British Columbia is directly linked to the Fukushima nuclear disaster without considering other potential sources of radiation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of cesium-134 in the marine waters off the coast of western North America, other than the Fukushima disaster.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the only salmon specimen found with detectable levels of cesium-134 in North America was in Osoyoos Lake, British Columbia, and no other radioactive salmon have been found.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the risk to human health posed by the radioactive salmon by using sensational language and stating that it is a \"risk\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on lazily researched, error-riddled assertions and flawed reporting, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
