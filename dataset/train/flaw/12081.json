{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the increase in poverty rates by stating that there are \"more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s.\" While the official poverty rate has increased, the extent of the increase may be subject to interpretation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that there are more poor people today as a percentage of the population compared to the 1970s. The expert's verdict mentions the official poverty rates, but it does not provide additional data or analysis to fully support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in poverty rates is solely due to the failure of anti-poverty measures and the allocation of funds. It does not consider other factors such as changes in the economy, job market, or societal dynamics that may contribute to poverty rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions factors such as declining work rates, stagnant wages, the rise of female-headed families, inferior education, and immigration as potential contributors to the increasing poverty rate. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in poverty rates beyond the claim's focus on the effectiveness of anti-poverty measures."}
