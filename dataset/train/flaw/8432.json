{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the potential impact on the United States' GDP by stating that it would cost approximately $164 billion over a decade. This is a significant amount and could be seen as an overstatement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a report from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning organization. While the report may provide some support for the claim, it is important to consider if there is enough evidence from other sources to fully substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and deporting legal workers would directly result in a specific cost to the United States' GDP. This assumption may not take into account other factors that could influence the economy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could impact the United States' GDP. It focuses solely on the potential cost of ending TPS and deporting legal workers, without considering other economic factors that could influence GDP growth or decline."}
