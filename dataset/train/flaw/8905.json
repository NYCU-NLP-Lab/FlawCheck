{"Lack enough support": "The claim that New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country is supported by data from the U.S. Census and the Tax Policy Center, which show that New Hampshire ranks third in average property tax per person. However, the data is from 2009, and more recent information is not provided. Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support to determine if the claim still holds true.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having the third-highest property tax in the country is not a desirable way to fund a government. However, this assumption is not supported with further evidence or reasoning, making it a problematic assumption.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the issue by stating that New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country. While it is true based on the available data from 2009, it does not account for potential changes in property tax rates in other states since then. Therefore, the claim may be an exaggeration if more recent data is considered.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and up-to-date picture of New Hampshire's property tax ranking. The data provided is from 2009, and there is no information on how the ranking may have changed over the years. This lack of up-to-date information can lead to uncertainties and falters in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why New Hampshire has high property taxes. It only mentions that New Hampshire relies heavily on property taxes as a revenue source due to the absence of income and sales taxes. However, there may be other factors contributing to the high property tax rates in the state, such as local government spending or property values.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the issue of high property taxes in New Hampshire. It acknowledges that the state ranks among the highest in property taxes based on available data from 2009.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts. It is supported by data from the U.S. Census and the Tax Policy Center, which show that New Hampshire ranks third in average property tax per person in 2009."}
