{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that the state budget funded technical colleges at 1989 levels, implying a significant lack of funding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that technical colleges were funded at 1989 levels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that funding levels from 1989 are inherently inadequate for technical colleges without providing a clear justification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the funding levels of technical colleges, such as changes in funding priorities or allocation methods, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the actual funding levels for technical colleges, as it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all funding sources and factors.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the actual funding levels for technical colleges by focusing solely on state funding and not considering other sources of funding."}
