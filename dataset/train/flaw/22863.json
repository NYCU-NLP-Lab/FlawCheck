{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the discovery of the submerged city of Heracleion was not made in October 2017, but rather in 1999.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the discovery by describing it as \"enormous in the historical preservation community\" and stating that it has been commissioned by museums around the world.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the claim of the discovery in October 2017.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the submerged city of Heracleion was thought to be lost under the sea for good, without providing any evidence or context for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the city of Heracleion, also known as Thonis-Heracleion, was subsumed by the Mediterranean over time due to soil erosion and rising sea levels, and was rediscovered in 2000."}
