{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because while Theresa Greenfield has not taken money directly from corporate PACs, she has received contributions from leadership PACs that receive a sizable chunk of their funding from corporate PACs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Greenfield has taken a pledge against corporate PAC donations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that refusing corporate PAC money is a major sacrifice for Democratic challengers, without providing evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Greenfield's funding, such as the possibility that the leadership PAC donations she has received may still tie her to special interests, even if they are not directly from corporate committees.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Greenfield has not taken any donations directly from corporate PACs, as confirmed by a review of her Federal Election Commission filings.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact or influence of leadership PAC donations, as campaign finance experts suggest that they may not grant the same access as direct corporate PAC donations.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the grassroots nature of Greenfield's campaign by stating that it is \"by Iowans, for Iowans,\" without providing evidence or context to support this claim."}
