{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the percentage of Texas high school graduates who go on to achieve a national certificate or a college degree. The expert's verdict mentions that the state's commissioner of higher education stated that just 20 percent of Texas eighth-graders earn a college degree or other advanced certificate within 11 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that only 20 percent of Texas high school graduates achieve a national certificate or a college degree.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that achieving a national certificate or a community college degree is equivalent to achieving a college degree. This assumption may not be accurate as the level of education and opportunities associated with each credential may vary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low percentage of Texas high school graduates who go on to achieve further education. Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to resources, and educational policies may contribute to this outcome."}
