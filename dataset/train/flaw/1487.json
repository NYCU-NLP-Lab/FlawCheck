{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential harm of the radiation exposure from TSA body scanners by comparing it to just three minutes of air travel, which may not accurately represent the level of radiation exposure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific data to support the assertion that the radiation from TSA body scanners is equivalent to three minutes of air travel at 30,000 feet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the radiation exposure from TSA body scanners is not harmful, but there may be alternative perspectives or studies that suggest otherwise.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding the safety concerns of TSA body scanners, as pilots and passengers have expressed fears and opposition to the protocols."}
