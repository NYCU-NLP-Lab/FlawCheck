There is no evidence or research to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or research to support the assertion that children have killed over 100,000 people in video games and online activities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of virtual kills in video games directly translates to real-life violence, which is a problematic assumption. There is no clear correlation between virtual violence and real-life actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the relationship between video games and violence, such as the influence of other factors like upbringing, mental health, and social environment."}
