{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street\" lacks direct evidence or a specific poll that supports this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a significant portion of the country that believes Obama has been too soft on Wall Street, but without concrete data, it is uncertain whether this assumption is accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why people might think Obama has been too soft on Wall Street, such as political opponents' anti-business rhetoric or differing opinions on financial regulations."}
