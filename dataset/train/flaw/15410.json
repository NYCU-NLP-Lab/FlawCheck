{"Understate": "The expert states that they would expect everyone past junior high school to recognize these old routines, implying that it is common knowledge and not a significant issue.", "Lack enough support": "The expert provides personal anecdotes and examples to support their claim, but there is no empirical evidence or extensive research cited to back up the assertion that newspaper reporters fall for old funny name gags.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert assumes that because they have observed instances of these gags being used, it means that newspaper reporters as a whole fall for them. This assumption may not be accurate or representative of the entire profession.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the Baltimore Sun article was eventually amended to quote Jack Morris rather than Jack Mehoff, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations for the use of funny names, such as typographical errors or intentional misquotes."}
