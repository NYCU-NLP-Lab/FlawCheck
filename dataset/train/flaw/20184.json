{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they requested details from the White House to verify the claim but did not receive a response. Without this information, they cannot reach a definitive determination on the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that one-third of Biden's appointees were first- or second-generation immigrants without providing specific evidence or a comprehensive list of appointees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that without knowing which appointees the claim refers to, it is difficult to determine the accuracy. There could be alternative explanations or interpretations for the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that they did not receive a response from the White House, and it is not clear how many officials Biden had appointed at the time. This lack of information may lead to uncertainties or gaps in the claim's accuracy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of diversity in Biden's administration by focusing only on first- or second-generation immigrants and not considering other aspects of diversity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the 2018 data published by the Pew Research Center, which states that 26.4% of the U.S. population were first- or second-generation immigrants. The claim suggests a higher proportion of immigrant representation in Biden's appointees without providing concrete evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of immigrant representation in Biden's appointees by stating that one-third of them were immigrants or children of immigrants without providing sufficient evidence or a comprehensive list of appointees."}
