{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the percentage of minimum wage workers who earn more money the following year. The claim states that \"two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year,\" while the expert's verdict reveals that it is actually two-thirds of those who continue to work, or 51 percent of all minimum wage workers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all minimum wage workers have the opportunity to gain skills and increase their wages within a year. However, the expert's verdict mentions that some minimum wage workers may choose to leave the labor force, which suggests that not all workers have the same opportunities for wage growth.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that two-thirds of minimum wage workers earn more money within a year. The expert's verdict mentions two papers that address the claim, but it is unclear if these papers provide comprehensive and conclusive evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why minimum wage workers may earn more money within a year. The expert's verdict mentions that some workers may leave the labor force or become unemployed, which could impact the percentage of workers who experience wage growth.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that it is not two-thirds of all minimum wage workers who earn more money within a year, but rather two-thirds of those who continue to work. This contradicts the initial claim's statement that two-thirds of all minimum wage workers achieve wage growth.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration of the wage growth experienced by minimum wage workers. While the claim suggests that a significant majority of workers achieve higher wages within a year, the expert's verdict reveals that it is actually around 51 percent of all minimum wage workers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the wage growth experienced by minimum wage workers. The claim's statement that two-thirds of all workers achieve wage growth within a year is not entirely accurate, as clarified by the expert's verdict."}
