{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"every income tax bracket will increase\" if Democrats get their way. While it is true that tax brackets will increase if no Congressional intervention occurs, it is not accurate to say that every single bracket will increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or support for the statement that \"every income tax bracket will increase.\" It is a general statement made by Rep. Mike Pence without providing any data or analysis to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Democrats want all tax brackets to increase. However, it does not provide any evidence or quotes from Democrats supporting this assumption. It is important to consider alternative viewpoints and motivations before accepting this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for tax policy. It presents a binary scenario where either Democrats get their way and all tax brackets increase or they don't and no tax brackets increase. There may be other options or compromises that could be considered."}
