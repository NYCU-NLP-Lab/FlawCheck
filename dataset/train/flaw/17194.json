{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as important details about the incident, such as the nature of the absentee ballots and whether they were completed by voters or blank, are unknown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of mail-in ballots in the ditch is evidence of voter fraud or wrongdoing, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the mail-in ballots being found in the ditch, such as a mishandling or delivery error by the postal service, rather than intentional tampering or fraud.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and complete picture of the incident, as some important details remain unknown.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the incident by not providing enough information about the potential impact on the election or the number of ballots involved.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim, as it is confirmed that three trays of mail, including mail-in ballots, were found in a ditch. However, the claim may be used to support false claims of widespread voter fraud, which contradicts the fact that voter fraud is rare.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the incident itself, but it may be used to exaggerate the prevalence or impact of voter fraud related to mail-in ballots."}
