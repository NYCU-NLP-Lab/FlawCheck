{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences for tenants who fail to pay rent due to the lack of government housing subsidy programs. The expert's verdict mentions that eviction procedures may begin if rent is not paid, but it does not elaborate on the potential impact on the tenants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to determine whether the landlord, Annette Cowen, would have the ability to carry out evictions if the government shutdown continued to stop landlords from receiving federal subsidies. The expert's verdict states that it is unclear whether Cowen would have the ability to carry out evictions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tenants are solely responsible for paying their rent and that the landlord has no obligation to provide any assistance during the government shutdown. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative solutions or support for tenants during this situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the landlord's directive to tenants. It is possible that the landlord's actions were influenced by other factors or concerns not mentioned in the claim."}
