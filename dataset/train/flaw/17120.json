{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential impact of the health care reform plans on reducing the costs of health care. The expert's verdict mentions that the Senate bill would increase total national health expenditures by $234 billion between 2010 and 2019, which suggests that the claim's assertion of reducing costs may be exaggerated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the health care reform plans will reduce the costs of health care. The expert's verdict includes statements from President Obama and Senate Democrats, but it does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict includes statements from both Democrats and Republicans, highlighting differing opinions on the impact of the health care reform plans on reducing costs. Republican Senator Charles E. Grassley argues that the Senate bill would not reduce the unsustainable growth in health care spending and may even increase costs. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim's assertion of reducing costs may be open to debate."}
