{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the need to vote by mail on the same day by stating that \"if you are voting by mail, you need to vote TODAY.\" This creates a sense of urgency that may not be entirely accurate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that states have their own laws about deadlines for receiving mail ballots. It fails to acknowledge that the deadlines vary by state and that voters should check with their local elections officials for accurate information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that \"USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day.\" It does not provide any specific evidence or source to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a national deadline to vote by mail, which is not accurate. It overlooks the fact that states have different deadlines and requirements for mail-in ballots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the alternative options available to voters, such as using official ballot drop boxes or drop-off sites instead of relying solely on mail-in ballots."}
