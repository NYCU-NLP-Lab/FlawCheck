{"Lack enough support": "The claim that bitter almond trees were banned in America in 1995 because it treats and prevents cancer lacks sufficient evidence to support it. There is no evidence corroborating this claim outside of its widespread repetition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the ban on bitter almond trees was enacted solely because it contains high levels of the cancer-fighting vitamin B17. However, there is no clear information about the legal status of bitter almonds, and the FDA's regulations allow almond paste and extract manufacturers to use the nuts as long as their products do not contain excessive levels of hydrocyanic acid.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the ban on bitter almond products may not be solely due to their potential cancer-fighting properties. The FDA's regulations indicate that bitter almonds are restricted due to their toxicity, and the agency allows their use in certain products as long as safe levels of hydrocyanic acid are not exceeded. This alternative explanation suggests that the ban may be more related to safety concerns rather than solely based on their cancer-fighting potential."}
