{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the maps show \"all the fires burning in Australia,\" when in reality they only show a limited number of fires detected by satellite data.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that the maps show all the fires in Australia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the maps accurately represent the severity and extent of the fires, when in fact the colors and icons on the maps represent the time of detection rather than the severity of the heat.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the maps, as they are sourced from MyFireWatch, a government site that detects heat sources in general, not exclusively bushfires."}
