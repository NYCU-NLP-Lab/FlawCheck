{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of China's currency manipulation by stating that it was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006. It is unclear if this is an accurate representation of the actual manipulation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to substantiate the accusation that Portman failed to address China's currency manipulation. The expert's verdict mentions that Fisher's spokesman cited several news articles from early 2006, but it is unclear if these articles provide substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that addressing China's currency manipulation was solely within Portman's authority and responsibility as the trade representative. It may be a problematic assumption to attribute the failure to address the issue solely to Portman.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Portman's actions or decisions as the trade representative. It assumes that Portman's support for free trade led him to give China a pass, without considering other factors that may have influenced his decisions.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if the claim contradicts any specific facts, as the provided information does not mention any specific contradictory evidence.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as the provided information does not provide specific details or comparisons that can be evaluated for exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication that the claim falters at times, as the provided information does not mention any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim."}
