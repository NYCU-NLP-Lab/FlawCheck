{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Obama that he has accomplished \"about 60 percent\" of his promises can be seen as an exaggeration, as it is higher than the percentage of promises categorized as \"Promise Kept\" or \"Compromise\" by the PolitiFact's Obameter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed up by specific evidence or data. It is based on President Obama's own assessment without providing specific details or examples of the promises fulfilled.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that fulfilling 60 percent of promises in three years is a significant achievement. However, this assumption may be subjective, as the significance of the percentage can vary depending on the nature and importance of the promises made.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as differences in how promises are categorized or assessed by different sources. The White House spokesperson's mention of \"achieved or made progress\" as the standard for assessing progress on the agenda suggests a potential difference in interpretation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times, as it relies on the accuracy and completeness of the promises tracked by the Obameter. The caveat mentioned by PolitiFact that some promises have not been updated in a year or more raises questions about the reliability of the data.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the progress made by President Obama if the Obameter's categorization of promises does not fully capture the extent of the accomplishments. This bias is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict but can be inferred based on the discrepancy between the claim and the Obameter's breakdown of promises.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only 30 percent of promises have been categorized as \"Promise Kept\" by the Obameter, which is significantly lower than the claimed 60 percent. This discrepancy indicates a contradiction between the claim and the available data."}
