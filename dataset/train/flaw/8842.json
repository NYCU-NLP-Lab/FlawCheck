{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of tax reform by stating that 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses. While there have been benefits reported, it is unclear if the number is accurate or if all the reported benefits are directly attributable to tax reform.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month. The evidence provided only mentions the estimate made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, but there is no further data or analysis to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the benefits received by workers are solely due to the tax reform, without considering other potential factors that may have influenced companies' decisions to provide raises or bonuses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the possibility that some of the reported benefits, such as bonuses, may have already been planned before the tax law was passed in order to retain workers in a tight labor market.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of tax reform by not acknowledging that the actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than the stated 90% estimate, according to an expert at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center."}
