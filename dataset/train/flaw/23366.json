{"Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility of nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) by presenting the government's current stance as definitive and implying that there are no plans for a pan-India NRC.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively state that the NRC will not be implemented nationwide. While the government has stated that no decision has been taken yet, it does not provide definitive evidence that a nationwide NRC will not be implemented in the future.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government's current stance on NRC is a guarantee that it will not be implemented nationwide. However, the government's past statements and the use of phrases like \"till now\" suggest that the possibility of a pan-India NRC cannot be completely ruled out.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the government's statement that no decision has been taken on a nationwide NRC. It is possible that the government is currently focused on implementing the NRC in specific regions or states before considering a nationwide rollout.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the government has not explicitly stated that NRC will not be implemented pan-India but has used phrases like \"at present\" or \"till now,\" leaving room for future decisions on a nationwide NRC.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the government's statement by presenting it as the \"first official confirmation\" and implying that it settles the debate on nationwide NRC, when in reality, it may be subject to change or further clarification.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the government's stance on NRC and relying solely on a single statement in the Lok Sabha, without considering other sources or statements made by government officials."}
