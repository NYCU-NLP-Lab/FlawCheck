{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a single video and does not provide any additional evidence or data to back up the assertion that the Uber vehicle was truly driverless at the time of running the red light.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Uber vehicle shown in the video was driverless, without providing conclusive evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the Uber vehicle shown in the video may have been driven by a human, despite having the capability to operate without a driver. This alternative explanation is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not clearly establish whether the Uber vehicle was truly driverless or if human error was involved. The expert's verdict mentions that Uber attributed the incident to human error.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the possibility of human involvement in the incident, as it focuses on the driverless aspect of the Uber vehicle running the red light without providing enough information about the potential role of a human driver.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Uber vehicle involved in the incident was not part of the self-driving pilot and was not carrying customers, as stated by Uber in their statement.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it simply states that a video shows a driverless Uber running a red light in San Francisco. However, the lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim could be seen as an exaggeration of the driverless aspect of the incident."}
