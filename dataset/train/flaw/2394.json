{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of deaths caused by botched surgeries by stating that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries. The actual study cited in the expert's verdict estimates that medical errors, including various types of errors beyond just botched surgeries, contribute to 251,454 deaths per year.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence. The person making the claim, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., refused to provide information to back up his claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of deaths caused by botched surgeries is solely the responsibility of doctors. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the study on medical errors includes a range of errors beyond just botched surgeries, such as communication breakdowns and medication mistakes, which may involve multiple healthcare professionals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that there is a need to transform the medical community due to the deaths caused by botched surgeries. However, the expert's verdict points out that no demand has been made by President Obama, the attorney general, or Black Lives Matter to transform the medical community in response to medical errors."}
