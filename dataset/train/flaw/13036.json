{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of homeless people found dead on the streets of Chicago due to record-low temperatures. Only seven deaths in various states had been linked to the extreme cold front, and none of the reported victims were listed as homeless.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to verify the claim that 15 homeless people were found frozen to death on the streets of Chicago.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 15 deaths were directly caused by the record-low temperatures, without providing any evidence or confirmation from authorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only one fatality was reported in Chicago during the storm, and it was an unidentified man hit by a snowplow.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the deaths of homeless people, as there is no evidence linking their deaths directly to the extreme cold weather."}
