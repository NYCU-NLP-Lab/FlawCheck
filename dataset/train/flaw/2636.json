{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the budget resolution on Pell Grants by not fully explaining the non-binding nature of the resolution and its limited effect on actual funding cuts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that Kelly Ayotte voted for a budget with $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The evidence provided includes statements from both campaigns and budget policy experts, but it does not provide a clear and definitive answer.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for a budget resolution automatically translates to supporting specific cuts to Pell Grants, which may be a problematic assumption as budget resolutions are broad and non-binding documents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Kelly Ayotte's votes on the budget resolution, such as supporting the overall package while opposing specific provisions."}
