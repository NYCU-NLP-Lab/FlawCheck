{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of \"Islamic-inspired terrorist attacks\" between 1970 and 2015 by stating that there were 157,519 attacks, while the actual number reported by the expert is 157,204.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented by the expert that the number of attacks is false and that the actual number is lower.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to back up the stated number of attacks.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 157,519 attacks were \"Islamic-inspired,\" which is not supported by the expert's statement. The expert mentions that the database does not systematically classify all attacks by ideology.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the number of attacks, such as attacks inspired by other ideologies or motivations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting an inaccurate number of attacks, which undermines its credibility.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
