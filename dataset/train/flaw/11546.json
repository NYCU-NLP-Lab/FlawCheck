{"Exaggerate": "The claim of the murder rate in Austin being \"up a whopping 83 percent\" is an exaggeration. The actual increase in the murder rate is 44 percent, according to the September 2015 report.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a small sample size of monthly reports, which can be misleading.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the murder rate is solely due to \"liberal compassion\" shown to convicts by President Barack Obama and others, which is a problematic assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not considering other periods of time when the murder rate in Austin may have increased even more, such as in May 2015 when it had ballooned 129 percent from the previous year.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in the murder rate in Austin, such as changes in socioeconomic factors or other local factors."}
