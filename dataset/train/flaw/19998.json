{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the amount of public funding for stadiums by only stating that 47 percent of the total cost came from public sources. There could be additional public funding not accounted for in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that 47 percent of the total cost came from public sources. It relies on a statement made by Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Duriya Farooqui without providing further evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 47 percent figure represents a significant amount of public funding for stadiums. However, without further context or comparison to other stadiums or time periods, it is unclear whether this percentage is high or low.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funding of stadiums, such as private funding or other sources of revenue. It presents the 47 percent figure as the primary source of funding without exploring other possibilities."}
