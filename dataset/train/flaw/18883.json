{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or research to support the assertion that a dentist can determine if someone has performed fellatio. The expert's verdict mentions limited research and isolated case reports, suggesting that there is not enough evidence to make a conclusive statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that dentists have the ability to accurately determine if someone has performed fellatio based solely on oral examination. The expert's verdict explains that several other potential causes would have to be ruled out before attributing any markings or injuries to fellatio.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the difficulty of identifying fellatio-related signs during a dental examination. The expert's verdict mentions that unless the patient is very young or shows signs of abuse, dental professionals generally do not consider bruising on the soft palate as indicative of fellatio.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the act of performing fellatio can, in some cases, leave visible markings or lesions in the mouth. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that such outcomes are not common and that dental professionals cannot regularly determine if someone has performed fellatio based on these markings alone.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for any markings or injuries found in a person's mouth, other than fellatio. This implies that attributing such findings solely to fellatio may not be accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and conclusive statement about a dentist's ability to determine if someone has performed fellatio. The expert's verdict highlights the limited research, various potential causes, and the need to rule out alternative explanations, indicating that the claim may not hold true in all cases."}
