{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the future deficits by stating that there will be an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. The expert's verdict indicates that the actual projected increase in public debt is $77 trillion over 30 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific sources or evidence to back up the statement about the projected deficits. The expert's verdict mentions that they had to reverse-engineer the dollar amounts using percentages from a report to check the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the projected deficits of $129 trillion are accurate and certain. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the figure of $77 trillion is specifically for public debt, which is the smaller of the two debt measurements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not mention any alternative explanations for the claim."}
