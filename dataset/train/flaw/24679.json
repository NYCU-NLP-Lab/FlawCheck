{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that Gareth Southgate is wearing a waistcoat with the words \"It's Coming Home\" repeatedly written on it, but the expert's analysis states that none of the genuine photographs of Southgate feature those words on his clothing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Gareth Southgate is wearing a waistcoat with the words \"It's Coming Home\" on it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the waistcoat worn by Southgate is related to the unofficial slogan of his club, but the expert's analysis suggests that there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis provides an alternative explanation for the waistcoat's popularity, attributing it to the \"Gareth Southgate effect\" and increased sales of waistcoats by the official suit supplier to the England team."}
