{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake. The claim is based on a statement made by Donald Trump during a speech, but there is no additional information or sources provided to verify this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that changing an early ballot is a common practice in Wisconsin, stating that \"very few people have done\" it prior to the 2016 election. However, this assumption is not supported by any evidence or data, and it is unclear how common or easy it is to change an early ballot in Wisconsin.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for why someone might want to change their early ballot. It only presents the option of changing a ballot if a mistake has been made, without exploring other potential reasons for wanting to change a vote.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and concise explanation of the process for changing an early ballot in Wisconsin. It provides some information about spoiling a ballot and requesting a new one, but the details are scattered throughout the text and may be confusing or unclear to readers.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact or consequences of changing an early ballot. It does not discuss any potential limitations, restrictions, or challenges that individuals may face when trying to change their vote."}
