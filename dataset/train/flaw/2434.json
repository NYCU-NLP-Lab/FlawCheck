{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of remittances on South and Central American countries by stating that they receive over 15 percent of their GDP in remittances. The expert's verdict mentions that no countries in South America have remittances anywhere near that percentage of GDP.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement about South America. The expert's verdict mentions that they could not find any countries on that continent with remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all remittances sent from the U.S. to Mexico are from illegal immigrants. The expert's verdict mentions that it's hard to determine how much remittances are sent by undocumented immigrants, as U.S. citizens and legal immigrants also send money.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the remittances sent to South and Central American countries. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim's statement about South America is not supported by data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no South American countries have remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual amount of remittances sent to Mexico. The expert's verdict mentions that the latest World Bank estimates show that Mexico received more than $25.6 billion in remittances from individuals in the United States in 2015, which is higher than what the claim states."}
