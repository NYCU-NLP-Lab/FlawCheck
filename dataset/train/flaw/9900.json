{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misinterpretation of an amendment to a law governing presidential transitions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law passed under Trump gives outgoing presidents control of American armed forces after Inauguration Day, which is not supported by the actual amendment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden became the president on January 20, 2021, and not Donald Trump.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of control that outgoing presidents have over the armed forces, suggesting that Trump could issue orders for all branches of the armed forces even though he was no longer commander in chief.", "Understate": "No significant understatement bias is evident in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by misrepresenting the amendment and its implications.", "Exist alternative explanation": "No alternative explanation bias is evident in the claim."}
