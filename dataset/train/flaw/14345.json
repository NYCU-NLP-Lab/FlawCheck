{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Joel Osteen's failure to provide shelter from the winter cold. The expert's verdict mentions that Osteen's church, Lakewood, was designated as a warming center and that hundreds of people arrived for shelter. However, it does not provide specific information on whether the church was able to accommodate all those in need or if there were any limitations or issues in providing adequate shelter.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Joel Osteen failed to provide shelter from the winter cold. The expert's verdict mentions that Osteen's church was designated as a warming center and that hundreds of people arrived for shelter. It also confirms the church's announcement and the government's confirmation. However, there is no further information or evidence provided to evaluate the effectiveness or adequacy of the shelter provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joel Osteen failed to provide shelter from the winter cold based on previous criticisms and controversies surrounding his actions during Hurricane Harvey. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the church was designated as a warming center and that Osteen himself confirmed the availability of shelter. Without more specific information or evidence, it is difficult to determine the validity of the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Joel Osteen's actions. The expert's verdict mentions that the church was designated as a warming center and that Osteen confirmed the availability of shelter. This suggests that there may be reasons or circumstances that could explain any perceived delay or hesitation in providing shelter, which the claim does not acknowledge.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joel Osteen failed to provide shelter from the winter cold. The expert's verdict mentions that the church was designated as a warming center and that Osteen confirmed the availability of shelter. This contradicts the claim's assertion that Osteen failed to provide shelter."}
