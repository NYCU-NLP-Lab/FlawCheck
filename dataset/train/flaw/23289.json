{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of gun-related crimes committed by legal gun owners, as it focuses on the majority being committed by illegal gun owners without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or statistics to back up the statement that the majority of gun-related crimes are committed by illegal gun owners.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that laws limiting the rights of law-abiding gun owners are unnecessary because most gun crimes are committed by illegal gun owners. This assumption may be problematic as it oversimplifies the complex issue of gun violence and does not take into account other factors contributing to crime.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for gun-related crimes that are not addressed in the claim, such as the role of mental health, socioeconomic factors, or access to firearms through legal channels.", "Contradict fact": "Without specific data to support the claim, it is difficult to determine if it contradicts any factual information. However, the claim may contradict the fact that there is a significant portion of gun-related crimes committed by legal gun owners, as suggested by some studies and experts.", "Exaggerate": "It is unclear if the claim exaggerates the extent of gun-related crimes committed by illegal gun owners, as there is no specific data provided. However, without sufficient evidence, the claim may be seen as an exaggeration.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to gun-related crimes and oversimplifying the issue by solely focusing on illegal gun owners."}
