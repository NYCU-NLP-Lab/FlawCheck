{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of gas produced by fracking on climate change, stating that it is worse than coal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that methane emissions from fracked shale gas are \"horrendously high\" without providing specific data or comparative analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to climate change, such as the lifetime and persistence of carbon dioxide emissions from coal."}
