{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the effectiveness of vaccination in reaching herd immunity by stating that \"the way to reach \u2018herd immunity\u2019 is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 is still a matter of debate and has been estimated to range between 50% and 90%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that achieving herd immunity is solely dependent on vaccination, without considering the potential role of natural infections in developing immunity. The expert's verdict mentions that immunity can be reached through natural infections as well.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support for the statement that \"the way to reach \u2018herd immunity\u2019 is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 is still uncertain and varies depending on factors such as the infectiousness of the disease.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or strategies for achieving herd immunity, such as a combination of vaccination and natural infections. The expert's verdict mentions that immunity can be developed through natural infections as well as vaccination.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by oversimplifying the concept of herd immunity and presenting it as a straightforward solution. The expert's verdict highlights the complexity and ongoing debate surrounding the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 is still uncertain and subject to ongoing research and debate. The expert's verdict mentions that researchers have not yet determined a concrete herd immunity threshold level for COVID-19."}
