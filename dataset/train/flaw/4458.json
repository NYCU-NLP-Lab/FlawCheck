{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of manuka honey by stating that it is \"better than all known antibiotics.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to back up the assertion that manuka honey is superior to all known antibiotics. The expert's verdict mentions that manuka honey has additional antimicrobial properties, but it does not provide enough evidence to support the claim fully.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that manuka honey's potential to avoid antibiotic resistance and fight certain strains of bacteria makes it better than all known antibiotics. This assumption may be problematic as there may be other factors to consider in determining the effectiveness of antibiotics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could contribute to the effectiveness of antibiotics. It solely focuses on the potential benefits of manuka honey without acknowledging other treatment options or approaches."}
