{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Senator Bill Nelson's decision on the Keystone pipeline by stating that he \"chose to side with President Obama\" against it. This implies that his decision had a significant impact on the project, which may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that Senator Bill Nelson actually chose to side with President Obama against the Keystone pipeline. It is merely an assertion made by a pro-Connie Mack super PAC without providing specific examples or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting President Obama's decision on the Keystone pipeline is against the interests of the people of Florida. It assumes that the project would lead to lower gas prices, more jobs, and greater energy security, without providing evidence to support these assumptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Senator Bill Nelson's stance on the Keystone pipeline. It presents his decision as a choice to side with President Obama, without considering other potential factors or reasons for his position.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making generalizations and oversimplifications. It portrays Senator Bill Nelson as a \"lockstep liberal\" without considering the complexities of his stance on the Keystone pipeline or other issues."}
