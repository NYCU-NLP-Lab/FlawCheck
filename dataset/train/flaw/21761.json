{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of the cancer vaccine by stating that it is already saving thousands of people, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it has only improved survivability in some cases and that the number of people \"cured\" is conflated with the total number of people treated.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that the cancer vaccine is already saving thousands of people.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cancer vaccine has cured thousands of people, without providing sufficient evidence or clarifying the distinction between those treated and those \"cured.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or treatments for cancer, as it presents the Cuban vaccine as the ultimate cure for cancer without mentioning other ongoing research or potential alternatives.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Cuban treatment is not a vaccine in the preventative sense, as clarified by the expert's verdict. It is an immunologic cancer therapy that provokes an immune response to attack the cancer's ability to grow.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information about the Cuban cancer vaccine, such as referring to it as a vaccine in the preventative sense and implying that it has already cured thousands of people.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
