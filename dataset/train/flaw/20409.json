{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the transportation funding bill by stating it as a \"billion-dollar tax increase for Georgians.\" The bill is projected to raise close to $1 billion a year, but it is not explicitly stated that it will be solely funded by taxes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the transportation funding bill is a tax increase. It is based on a tweet from Debbie Dooley, who is associated with the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots, but no additional sources or evidence are provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transportation funding bill is a tax increase without considering the possibility that it includes a mix of taxes and fees. The article mentions that the bill includes a single excise tax on gasoline, fees for electric car and heavy truck drivers, and a $5 per-night fee on hotel/motel stays.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the funding bill, such as the need to address the state's backlog of transportation projects or the shift from sales and excise taxes to a single excise tax on gasoline.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the transportation funding bill includes a mix of taxes and fees, not just a tax increase. The article provides information on the different revenue sources included in the bill.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
