{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it suggests that Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns used the same tactics and techniques as Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign criticized in 2018, without providing enough evidence or clear examples to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or specific examples to demonstrate that Obama's campaigns used the same tactics and techniques as Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by equating the actions of Obama's campaigns with the actions of Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign, without considering the differences in scale, intent, and potential rule-breaking or criminality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may have influenced the tactics and techniques used by Obama's campaigns, such as changes in technology, campaign strategies, or legal and ethical considerations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama campaign accessed voters' Facebook information with their permission, while Cambridge Analytica allegedly accessed data without users' consent.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential rule-breaking and nefariousness of Cambridge Analytica's actions compared to the actions of Obama's campaigns, as suggested by investigative reports and allegations of criminality."}
