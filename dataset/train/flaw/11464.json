{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential threat of panther attacks by stating that there has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida, while the expert's verdict acknowledges that there have been instances of panthers attacking livestock and pets.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that there has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no verified panther attack on a human in modern times, but it does not provide comprehensive historical data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of recorded panther attacks on humans means that they have never occurred. However, this assumption may overlook unreported or undocumented incidents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the absence of panther attacks, such as the natural behavior of panthers to avoid human encounters or the effectiveness of existing protective measures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been instances of panthers attacking livestock and pets, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the absence of panther attacks by stating it as an absolute truth without acknowledging the limitations of available data or the potential for unreported incidents.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a sweeping statement about the entire history of Florida without providing specific evidence or historical records to support it."}
