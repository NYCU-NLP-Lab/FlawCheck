{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement that the Earth \"has not warmed for the last 17 years\" by ignoring the overall trend of rising temperatures over the past century.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a lack of significant warming in the past 17 years contradicts the theory of climate change, which is a problematic assumption as climate change involves long-term trends and not just short-term fluctuations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it cherry-picks a specific time period (17 years) without considering the broader context of long-term temperature trends.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the lack of significant warming in the past 17 years, such as natural climate variability and the influence of other factors on short-term temperature fluctuations."}
