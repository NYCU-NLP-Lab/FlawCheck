{"Understate": "The claim may understate Hillary Clinton's position on separating commercial banking and speculative banking by not providing a comprehensive analysis of her stance on the issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Hillary Clinton \"couldn't bring herself\" to support the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's failure to mention the separation of commercial and speculative banking means she is against it, without considering alternative reasons for her omission.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Clinton has not explicitly supported the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, such as considering it a less effective solution or having alternative approaches to regulating the banking industry."}
