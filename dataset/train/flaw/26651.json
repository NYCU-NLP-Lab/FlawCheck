{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual beer excise tax rates in Tennessee by only considering the flat per-barrel excise tax paid directly to the state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one source, the Tax Foundation map, to support the assertion that Tennessee has some of the lowest beer excise tax rates in the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flat per-barrel excise tax is the only factor to consider when determining the beer excise tax rates in Tennessee, without considering additional taxes such as the wholesale tax mentioned by the brewmaster.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations for the perceived low beer excise tax rates in Tennessee, such as the inclusion of other taxes or fees that are not accounted for in the Tax Foundation map.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the contention made by the Tennessee Malt Beverage Association, which argues that the taxes Tennesseans pay for beer are among the highest in the nation."}
