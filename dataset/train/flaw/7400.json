{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by President Trump that it is \"statistically impossible\" for him to have lost the election is an exaggeration. There is no statistical evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "President Trump and his legal team have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of widespread voter fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "President Trump's claim that the election was \"rigged\" is based on a problematic assumption that has not been substantiated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that President Trump's claims of election fraud are an attempt to deceive the public and push conspiracy theories, rather than being based on factual evidence."}
