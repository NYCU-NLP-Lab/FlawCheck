{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that it is easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors. This assumption may not be entirely accurate and could be based on limited evidence or biased perspective.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the US has an easier time obtaining flight manifests from EU nations compared to EU nations obtaining them from their own neighbors. Without concrete evidence, the claim may be lacking in credibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that the negotiation and implementation of the United States\u2013European Union Agreement on Passenger Name Records began before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. This contradicts the implication that Clinton played a significant role in negotiating the agreement.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and lengthy process involved in negotiating the agreement. It suggests that the agreement was solely a result of Clinton's involvement, while in reality, it was part of a series of negotiations spanning a decade.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the perceived security deficiencies among EU nations, such as differences in intelligence sharing practices or other factors beyond the ease of obtaining flight manifests. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
