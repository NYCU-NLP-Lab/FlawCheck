{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of prisoners released from federal prison under the Obama administration by stating that 38,000 prisoners were released, when in reality the decline in the federal prison population was about 12,000 people.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific details to back up the statement that 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the decrease in the federal prison population is solely due to the release of prisoners under the Obama administration's criminal justice reforms, when there may be alternative explanations for the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decline in the federal prison population, such as changes in sentencing policies or shifts in crime rates, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the 38,000 figure does not reflect the number of federal inmates who were actually released under or because of the Obama administration.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual decrease in the federal prison population, as it only focuses on the decline of 12,000 people from the start to the end of Obama's presidency, while ignoring the larger decrease from the peak at the end of 2012 to the end of 2018.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by using misleading data and comparisons, such as comparing the high point under Obama with the federal prison count almost two years into Trump's presidency."}
