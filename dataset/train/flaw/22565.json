{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the complexity of the tax code by stating that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes. The expert's verdict suggests that this may be a political spin on the facts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the assertion that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes. This lack of support makes the claim questionable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax code is so complicated that the majority of Americans cannot do their own taxes without professional help. This assumption may not be accurate and could be subjective.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the complexity of the tax code and the need for professional help, such as political motivations or differing perspectives on tax policy."}
