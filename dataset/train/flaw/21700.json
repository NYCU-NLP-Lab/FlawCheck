{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Adam Schiff approves questions from witnesses. It states that \"the rules\" do not allow any witnesses to be questioned unless the question is approved by Adam Schiff, which is not entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its assertion that Adam Schiff has complete control over which questions are approved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of involvement of the President's legal counsel is a biased rule, without considering the reasons or legal procedures behind this decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the involvement of the President's legal counsel is incorporated into the phase handled by the House Judiciary Committee."}
