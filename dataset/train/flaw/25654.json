{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people who lose their private insurance every year due to employment changes. The actual number is not 50 million, but rather \"just under 50 million\" according to the analysis cited by the Sanders campaign.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the analysis cited by the Sanders campaign is based on a survey from 2014 and population estimates, which may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all individuals who quit their jobs, go unemployed, or have their employer change their insurance policy will lose their private insurance. This assumption may not hold true in all cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the number of people who lose their private insurance, such as individuals voluntarily choosing to switch to a different insurance plan or being eligible for other forms of coverage."}
