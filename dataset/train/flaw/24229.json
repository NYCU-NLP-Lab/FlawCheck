{"Understate": "The claim may be considered an understatement because the expert's verdict states that the average family brings home $4,469 less (and $5,702 less when using median income) than they did five years ago. The claim only mentions a decrease of $4,000, which is slightly lower than the actual decline in income.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the assertion that the average family is bringing home $4,000 less than five years ago. However, the expert's verdict provides data from the U.S. Census Bureau that confirms the decrease in family income.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in average family income is a result of economic stagnation. While the expert's verdict mentions economic stagnation as a major talking point, it does not explicitly state that it is the cause of the decrease in income.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the decrease in average family income. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the decline in income is a result of the recession that began in 2007.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or data provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the decrease in average family income. The expert's verdict confirms the decline in income based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times or present inconsistent information. The expert's verdict supports the claim and provides additional data to back it up."}
