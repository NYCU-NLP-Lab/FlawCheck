{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the change in law carried by State Sen. Paul Bettencourt stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district. It is not clear how the change in law directly led to the prevention of the tax increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in law was solely responsible for stopping the tax increase. It does not consider other potential factors or variables that could have influenced the decision of the Dallas school board.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the change in law by not highlighting any potential negative consequences or unintended effects that may have resulted from the higher voting threshold imposed on local taxing units.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why the Dallas school board failed to approve the tax hike, other than the change in law. The claim does not explore or consider these alternative explanations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear causal link between the change in law and the prevention of the tax increase. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis or explanation of how exactly the change in law influenced the decision of the Dallas school board.", "Contradict fact": "No contradictory facts were identified in the provided information.", "Exaggerate": "No evidence of exaggeration was found in the provided information."}
