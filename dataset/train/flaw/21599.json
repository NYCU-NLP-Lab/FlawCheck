{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that ABVP members in Assam were protesting against NRC, CAB, and CAA.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo circulating on social media accurately represents the views and actions of ABVP members in Assam, which is later proven to be false.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the original banner in the photo actually supports the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and not protests against it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The conflicting reports about the origin of the photo (Ahmedabad rally vs. JNU campus) suggest that there might be alternative explanations for its context and purpose."}
