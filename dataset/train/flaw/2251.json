{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Marco Rubio \"skipped 18 defense votes including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.\" While Rubio did miss 18 defense votes, they were all related to a single bill, and he actually voted for the overall bill, including the amendment to arm the Kurds.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide the full context of the missed votes and the reasons behind them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that missing these specific votes indicates a lack of support for arming the Kurds to fight ISIS, without considering other factors or explanations for Rubio's absence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Rubio's missed votes, as he was campaigning for president at the time and may have had scheduling conflicts or other priorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rubio actually voted for the overall bill, including the amendment to arm the Kurds, while Ted Cruz voted against it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by failing to provide the full picture and misleads viewers by not mentioning that all of Rubio's skipped votes were related to one bill."}
