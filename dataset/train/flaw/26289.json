{"Understate": "The claim may understate the flammability of Under Armour garments compared to other garments of their type. The expert's verdict provides evidence of a ban on certain lines of synthetic clothing, including Under Armour, due to their substantial burn risk.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Under Armour garments are more flammable than other garments of their type. The expert's verdict provides some anecdotal evidence and information about flammability regulations, but it does not directly compare Under Armour garments to other similar garments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Under Armour garments are inherently more flammable than other garments of their type without providing clear evidence or a basis for this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions a ban on synthetic clothing, including Under Armour, due to burn risks, but it does not explicitly state that Under Armour garments are more flammable than other similar garments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that clothing containing synthetic materials like polyester can melt and fuse to the skin when exposed to extreme heat and flames, leading to disfiguring burns. This suggests that the flammability of Under Armour garments may be due to the materials used, rather than being specific to the brand itself. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Under Armour garments are more flammable than other garments of their type."}
