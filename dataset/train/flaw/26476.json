{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential tax savings for some households, as it assumes the typical household claims a standard deduction rather than itemizing deductions. This could result in lower savings for households that itemize deductions, such as for medical expenses, which would be eliminated under the House bill.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one example of a median household of four in Wisconsin getting a $2,000 tax cut. More data and examples would be needed to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the House Republican tax plan is designed to be a middle-class tax cut, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the complaints about the tax plan from big businesses, which are not addressed in the claim."}
