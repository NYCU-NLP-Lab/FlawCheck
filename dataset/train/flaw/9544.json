{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the possibility that a megalodon capsized a South African charter vessel in April 2013. The provided evidence suggests that this claim is based on a fictional episode of a television show and lacks substantive evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no genuine inquiry or controversy among legitimate scientists regarding the possibility of megalodons still existing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the event of a megalodon capsizing a South African charter vessel actually occurred, despite the lack of evidence or reporting on such an event.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the alleged capsizing of the South African charter vessel, such as natural causes or other marine creatures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the current scientific belief that megalodons have been extinct for more than a million years."}
