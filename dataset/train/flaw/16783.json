{"Contradict fact": "The claim initially suggests that Mamata Banerjee and Amit Shah are holding an envelope with 'Jai Shri Ram' written on it, but the expert's verdict contradicts this by stating that the image is photoshopped.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove the authenticity of the image or the message it conveys.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image is genuine and mocks Mamata Banerjee for her supposed hypocrisy, without providing any substantial evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the image is photoshopped and that the original photograph was taken during a meeting between Mamata Banerjee and Amit Shah to discuss the National Register for Citizens (NRC) exercise."}
