{"Exaggerate": "The claim of having the \"fastest growing airport in America\" may be an exaggeration, as there are other airports experiencing significant growth as well.", "Lack enough support": "The claim of attracting \"nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs\" does not provide enough evidence or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the growth of the airport and the increase in jobs are directly credited to the actions of the county government, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The growth and job creation at the airport may be primarily driven by consolidations and convulsions in the airline business, rather than the actions of the county government."}
