{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which schools are removing analog clocks. The expert's verdict mentions that schools in the UK are not replacing analog clocks in all classrooms, but it does not provide information about the frequency or scale of this practice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that schools are removing analog clocks because students no longer know how to tell time. The expert's verdict mentions that some UK sources suggested replacing analog clocks in examination halls due to difficulties estimating time remaining, but it does not provide comprehensive data or research on the topic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of analog clocks is solely due to students' inability to tell time. However, the expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as minimizing disruptions during exams, may also contribute to this practice.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that one alternative explanation could be teaching students how to read analog clocks instead of removing them. This suggests that there are alternative approaches to addressing the issue, which contradicts the claim's implication that removing analog clocks is the only solution."}
