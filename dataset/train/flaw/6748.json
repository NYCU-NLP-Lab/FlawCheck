{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Mason Classical Academy never adopted Common Core in the first place, so the improvement in test results cannot be linked to abandoning Common Core.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of abandoning Common Core on the school's test results, implying that it caused the results to go from mediocre to outstanding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a causal relationship between abandoning Common Core and the school's improved test results.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that abandoning Common Core was the sole factor contributing to the school's improved test results, without considering other possible factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that four public schools that participate in Common Core ranked above the Mason Classical Academy in Mathematics."}
