{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Obamacare on taxes by stating that it raises 18 different taxes, while the expert's analysis finds that only five taxes might apply to individuals making less than $250,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that Obamacare raises 18 different taxes. The expert's analysis finds that there are only five taxes that might apply to individuals making less than $250,000.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the promise made by President Obama not to raise taxes for families making less than $250,000 is contradicted by the fact that Obamacare raises taxes. However, the expert's analysis shows that the taxes raised by Obamacare mostly target health insurance companies, drug manufacturers, medical device makers, or high earners, not individuals making less than $250,000.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the taxes raised by Obamacare. The expert's analysis shows that these taxes are primarily aimed at specific industries or high earners, rather than individuals making less than $250,000."}
