{"Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the state's tax burden has caused the loss of 190,000 residents in 2009. More evidence or data would be needed to fully support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state's tax burden is the sole or primary factor causing residents to leave. There may be other factors at play, such as job opportunities, cost of living, or personal circumstances, that contribute to people moving out of the state.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the loss of residents, such as the decline of wealthy households moving into the state, as mentioned in the Boston College study."}
