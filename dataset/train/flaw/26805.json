{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check\" is based on a study that only surveyed 251 people out of 2,568 households. This small sample size may not provide enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 35.7 percent of respondents who reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer means that those guns were purchased without a background check. It may be a problematic assumption to equate \"obtaining from somewhere other than a licensed dealer\" with \"no background check.\"", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been re-rated from Mostly True to Half True, indicating that the claim may not always hold up under scrutiny or may have some inconsistencies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there has been criticism of the claim and that the statistic has been repeated and questioned after the Newtown school shooting. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the data that challenge the claim."}
