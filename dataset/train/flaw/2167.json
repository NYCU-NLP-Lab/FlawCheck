{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential job growth that would result from the USMCA trade deal.

However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the U.S. International Trade Commission's analysis does not provide yearly job growth figures, but rather estimates the impact of the trade deal after six years of implementation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. International Trade Commission's analysis does not project job increases on a yearly basis, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in this claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim faltering at times in this case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation mentioned in the expert's verdict for the claim made by Larry Kudlow."}
