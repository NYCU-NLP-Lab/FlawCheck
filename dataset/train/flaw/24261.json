{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the law by stating that it outlaws abortion before most women even know they're pregnant. The experts mention that it is unclear when \"most women\" know they're pregnant, but it is acknowledged that women who are actively trying to conceive tend to know sooner.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it lacks specific data on when \"most women\" know they're pregnant. However, it is acknowledged that women who are not actively trying to conceive are less likely to be aware of a pregnancy until well after six weeks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of specific data on when \"most women\" know they're pregnant. The experts mention that they couldn't find data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law is one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country, but this is not explicitly addressed by the experts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of an alternative explanation being presented in the claim or by the experts."}
