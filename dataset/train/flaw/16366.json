{"Exaggerate": "It is possible that the claim exaggerates the impact of the Say Yes Buffalo program on graduation rates. The claim states that graduation rates have increased from \"around 48 percent\" to \"64 percent\" since the program launched. However, the available data shows that the graduation rates in the district have fluctuated between 46.8 percent and 61.7 percent, with the latest data indicating a rate of 64 percent when including August graduates. Therefore, the claim may be exaggerating the extent of the improvement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support in terms of providing specific data or evidence to back up the statement. While it mentions the graduation rates before and after the program's implementation, it does not provide additional information or sources to verify the accuracy of the claim. This lack of supporting evidence weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in graduation rates. It attributes the improvement solely to the Say Yes Buffalo program without exploring other factors that may have contributed to the increase. Factors such as changes in educational policies, teaching methods, or socio-economic conditions could also have influenced graduation rates in the district. The claim's failure to acknowledge these alternative explanations introduces a potential bias."}
