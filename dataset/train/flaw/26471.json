{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the money taken by the Clinton Foundation is \"clearly illegal\" without providing sufficient evidence or legal analysis to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific examples or evidence to demonstrate that the donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments are illegal.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that donations to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state are equivalent to money sent directly to her, without considering the foundation's separate legal entity and governance structure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the donations, such as the foundation's global programs and the tailored grants for specific missions that are usually provided by foreign governments."}
