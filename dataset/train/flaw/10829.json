{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating McCaskill's independence by stating that nonpartisan experts consistently rank her as one of the most independent senators. The evidence provided only shows that she is ranked as one of the least likely to vote in line with her own party, not as one of the most independent overall.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim provides evidence from Congressional Quarterly, GovTrack, and National Journal to support McCaskill's independent streak. However, it is unclear if this evidence is enough to fully support the claim that she is consistently ranked as one of the most independent senators.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being ranked as one of the most independent senators is a positive attribute. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential drawbacks or criticisms of being independent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of alternative explanations being considered in the claim."}
