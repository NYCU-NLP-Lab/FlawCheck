{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the safety of Cross River state by stating that it has the least total crime in the country, whereas the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that at least 20 other states have fewer instances of crime.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is not backed up by the best available statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported crime statistics accurately reflect the actual crime rate in Cross River state. However, the director of household statistics at the bureau mentioned that there could be unreported crimes, and under-reporting is often an issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the low reported crime rate in Cross River state, such as the fear of victimization by the police, which may deter people from reporting crimes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that 1.61% of all crimes in the country are in Cross River state, which is higher than the 1.1% claimed by the governor.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as the governor himself later bemoaned the state's security challenges, which contradicts his initial claim of Cross River being the safest state."}
