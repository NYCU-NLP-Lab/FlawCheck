{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides financial documents listing the banks that have provided credit for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which supports the claim that Wells Fargo and Chase are invested in the pipeline.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the banks' funding of the pipeline constitutes a violation of Indigenous rights and a threat to water sources and burial grounds. This assumption may be problematic as it does not provide concrete evidence or analysis to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore alternative explanations for why Wells Fargo and Chase may be invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline, such as potential financial benefits or legal obligations. This lack of exploration suggests a bias towards presenting only one perspective."}
