{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of seats lost by the BJP with a margin less than 2000 votes. The expert's verdict confirms that only two candidates actually lost by such a margin.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a tweet from a TV channel and a deleted tweet from a BJP MP, both of which do not provide concrete evidence or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if there had been a 3% increase in voting, the entire game would have changed. However, this is a problematic assumption as it does not take into account other factors that could have influenced the election results.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that only two BJP candidates actually lost with a margin below 2000 votes, while the claim states that 36 candidates lost by such a margin.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the number of seats lost by the BJP and by not providing accurate information.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the BJP lost the election due to factors other than the margin of votes, such as the popularity of the AAP or the overall political climate in Delhi."}
