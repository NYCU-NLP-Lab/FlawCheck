{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the financial losses of the United States Postal Service (USPS) by stating that they \"lose a fortune\" with Amazon. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the USPS has reported significant losses, but it does not support the claim that they are losing a substantial amount of money solely because of Amazon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the USPS is losing money specifically because of its dealings with Amazon. The expert's verdict mentions that the details of the USPS's deals with private shippers like Amazon are not made public, so it is difficult to determine the exact financial impact of the Amazon deal on the USPS.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the USPS is losing money solely because of its association with Amazon. However, the expert's verdict explains that the USPS's financial woes are attributed to various factors, including a 2006 law and the decline in first-class mail revenue. This undermines the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the USPS's financial losses, such as the decline in first-class mail revenue and the pre-funding of future retirees' health benefits. This suggests that there are other factors contributing to the financial woes of the USPS, not just its association with Amazon.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the USPS deals with private shippers like Amazon at a break-even venture. The expert's verdict mentions that the USPS is required by law to price parcel delivery above its cost, and the USPS has stated that their competitive package products, including those delivered for Amazon, cover their costs.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim or the expert's verdict faltering at times."}
