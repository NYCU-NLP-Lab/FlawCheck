{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the BJP and RSS engaged in an organized campaign to photoshop an image of Pranab Mukherjee wearing an RSS cap. This implies a deliberate and widespread effort to deceive.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide concrete evidence or sources to support the allegation that the BJP and RSS photoshopped the image. It relies on tweets from Congress leaders and supporters as well as the mention of an article written by a suspended Congress leader.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image was photoshopped by the BJP and RSS without providing any evidence to support this assumption. It also assumes that the BJP and RSS engaged in a \"dirty tricks\" campaign.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image was photoshopped by suggesting that it is the \"actual picture\" on the left and the photoshopped version on the right. This contradicts the evidence that the image was indeed manipulated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the photoshopped image, such as the possibility that it was created by individuals unrelated to the BJP and RSS."}
