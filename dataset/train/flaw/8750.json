{"Contradict fact": "The claim suggests poor hygiene conditions at a food factory in Malaysia, but the expert's verdict states that the claims are false and the photo does not belong to the Malaysian company in question.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single photo and does not provide any additional evidence or information to support the assertion of poor hygiene conditions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo depicts poor hygiene conditions at a food factory in Malaysia, but the expert's verdict reveals that the photo is actually from a factory in China and is unrelated to the Malaysian company.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the photo, stating that it was taken in a Chinese factory before the Chinese New Year Festival in 2014 and that the employees in the photo had already resigned. This contradicts the claim that the photo shows poor hygiene conditions at a food factory in Malaysia."}
