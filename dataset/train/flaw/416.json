{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of government debt growth during the first 29 months of the Obama administration by stating it as \"$4 billion per day\" when it is actually around $3.75 billion per day.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to directly attribute the debt growth to President Obama, as it does not consider the debt inherited from the previous administration or other factors contributing to the debt growth.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government debt growth is solely the responsibility of President Obama without considering other factors or parties involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the debt growth, such as new legislation enacted under the previous administration or other external factors."}
