{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the influence and involvement of George Soros in bankrolling John Kasich's super PAC. The expert points out that there is no evidence of a secret conspiracy or clandestine donations, and that donors to super PACs are public.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that millionaires are working side by side with George Soros to fund Kasich's super PAC. The expert mentions that there are only two individuals linked to Soros who have donated to the super PAC, and their donations are not indicative of a widespread network.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the donations from individuals linked to George Soros automatically mean that Soros himself is controlling and manipulating Kasich's campaign. The expert argues that these donations do not necessarily reflect Soros' political philosophies and that the donors have also supported Republican causes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the donations to Kasich's super PAC. The expert suggests that the donors may have their own motivations and political affiliations that are not directly tied to Soros.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no campaign finance rules preventing Soros from openly donating to a super PAC. The expert points out that there is no need for Soros to hide his donations if he were artificially manipulating Kasich's campaign.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in presenting a coherent and well-supported argument. The expert highlights the lack of evidence and the implausibility of a secret conspiracy involving Soros and Kasich's super PAC."}
