{"Lack enough support": "The claim that people with Type-A blood are more susceptible to COVID-19 is based on a preliminary draft of a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in any journal. The study is also limited in sample size and geographic scope, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings.", "Falters at times": "The expert points out that the study is a draft and not yet confirmed or disconfirmed by additional studies. This suggests that the claim may not be entirely reliable or conclusive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that blood type is a significant factor in determining susceptibility to COVID-19. However, the expert mentions that the association between blood type and vulnerability to infection with multiple viruses is not yet fully understood or confirmed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert highlights that while the study provides an interesting observation, it is important to wait for additional studies to confirm or disconfirm the findings. This implies that there may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the susceptibility to COVID-19, beyond just blood type."}
