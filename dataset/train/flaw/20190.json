{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decrease in violence during the time in office, stating a specific percentage (15%) without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is actually less violence today compared to the time the claim refers to. The expert's verdict states that the violent crime rate was 5.1% lower in the previous year compared to 2016.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the specific percentage decrease in violence during the time in office.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in violence during the time in office is solely attributable to the actions or policies of the individuals in question, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the decrease in violence, such as the continuation of the decline in the first half of 2020 despite an increase in homicides. This implies that factors other than the actions of the individuals in office may have influenced the levels of violence."}
