The video provided in the report is unrelated to the actor's arrest and only shows the arrest of two women suspected of selling drugs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actor's arrest is related to his role in a TV show critical of the police, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the PDEA spokesman confirmed that the actor has not been arrested for any drug-related offense.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the actor's arrest that are not mentioned in the claim."}
