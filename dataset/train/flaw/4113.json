{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Governor Scott Walker took $1 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman, when in fact the money was given to a super PAC supporting Walker, not directly to him or his campaign.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the businessman is \"pro-Putin,\" as there is no direct evidence of this.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the donation from the businessman implies a connection between Walker and Putin, without providing substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the donation, such as the businessman's support for Walker's political ideology or policies, rather than a direct connection to Putin."}
