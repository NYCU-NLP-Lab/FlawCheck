{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the damage to the NDTV van, as the journalist from NDTV mentioned that while the van was damaged, it was not torched.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or official tweet from BBC Hindi to confirm that they reported the incident of the NDTV van being torched.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the screenshot shared by the DD News anchor is true and accurate, without verifying its authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the NDTV van was not specifically targeted and that several media OB vans were torched by a mob in Lucknow during the protests against the Citizenship Act.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the screenshot shared by the DD News anchor is fake, as confirmed by the editor of BBC Hindi.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the violence and damage during the protests in Lucknow by focusing only on the NDTV van, while several other vehicles, including police vehicles and media OB vans, were also torched."}
