{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the potential consequences of President Trump's impeachment by stating that \"everybody would be very poor.\" The expert's verdict suggests that there is no concrete evidence to support this claim and that the market did not have a significant reaction to Trump's legal troubles.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Trump's impeachment would lead to catastrophic financial ramifications and that the country's economy depends solely on his \"thinking.\" This assumption is not supported by sufficient evidence and can be seen as problematic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that \"everybody would be very poor\" if President Trump were impeached. The expert's verdict mentions that the market did not react significantly to Trump's legal troubles, indicating a lack of support for the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation by stating that the market expects Trump to avoid impeachment unless the special counsel investigation can directly tie him to collusion with Russia. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that everyone would be very poor if Trump were impeached."}
