{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Obama's 2012 policy on younger immigrants by suggesting that it directly \"created\" the flood of children at the border. While the policy may have played a role, it is not the sole cause of the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Obama's policy directly caused the influx of children at the border. It is based on conservative talking points and opinions rather than concrete evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the children currently arriving at the border were directly influenced by Obama's 2012 policy. However, it is important to consider other factors such as violence, poverty, and instability in their home countries as potential motivations for migration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in children crossing the border, such as the conditions in their home countries or changes in immigration enforcement policies under the Trump administration."}
