{"Exaggerate": "The claim that President Obama's health care reform \"slashed $500 billion from Medicare\" is an exaggeration. The expert's verdict states that the law actually reduces the growth of Medicare spending by just over $500 billion over 10 years, not taking $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that $500 billion was slashed from Medicare.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any reduction in the growth of Medicare spending is equivalent to slashing funds from Medicare. However, the expert's verdict explains that the intention behind reducing the growth in Medicare spending is to offset the overall cost of the health care reform law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claim, such as the fact that Medicare spending would have grown at a faster rate without the health care reform law. This suggests that there are alternative factors influencing Medicare spending."}
