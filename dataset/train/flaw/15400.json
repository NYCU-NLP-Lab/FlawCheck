{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Biden's tax proposal by stating that it will take a 40 percent cut of profits from Americans who sell their home, while in reality, only those making over $1 million in taxable income annually would be subject to the 39.6 percent tax rate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the current capital gains tax rate for the highest income bracket, which is 20 percent, compared to Biden's proposed 39.6 percent tax rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that Biden's tax proposal will result in a 40 percent cut of profits from home sales.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax proposal will apply to all Americans who sell their homes, without considering the income threshold of $1 million that Biden's plan specifies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations or consider other factors that may affect capital gains taxes or the housing market."}
