{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the use of drones by PETA to follow hunters in other countries, as it is stated that PETA is \"using this really fancy drone\" when in reality they have only announced their intention to acquire drones for monitoring hunters.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of PETA's drone usage, as it is mentioned that PETA plans to use drones domestically and abroad, but the claim focuses only on their use in other countries.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or information to support the assertion that PETA is actively using drones to follow hunters in other countries. It only mentions the announcement of PETA's intention to acquire drones.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that PETA's use of drones to monitor hunters is a \"war against animal cruelty,\" which may be a problematic assumption as it implies a biased perspective on hunting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for PETA's interest in acquiring drones or their potential use for monitoring hunters."}
