{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the woman constable was raped and murdered. The photographs and social media posts circulating are not enough to establish the veracity of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman constable's death was the result of rape and murder without any concrete evidence or official confirmation. It jumps to a conclusion without proper investigation or verification.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the woman constable died in a road accident, not as a result of rape and murder. The claim is therefore in direct contradiction to the available facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by linking it to the alleged rape case in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras. It tries to draw parallels between the two incidents, even though they may be unrelated.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting unverified information and relying on social media posts and photographs without proper investigation or confirmation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the woman constable's death, stating that it was a result of a road accident. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim of rape and murder."}
