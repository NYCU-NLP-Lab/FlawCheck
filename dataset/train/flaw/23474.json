{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the job gains in Texas by stating that 1.4 million jobs were created, while the expert's verdict states that the actual number is 1.36 million jobs.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the job losses in the rest of the country by stating that 400,000 jobs were lost, while the expert's verdict does not provide a specific number for job losses in the rest of the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific sources or data to support the numbers mentioned, which may indicate a lack of enough support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that job creation in Texas is solely attributed to Rick Perry's policies as governor, without considering other factors that may have contributed to job growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that Texas accounted for 27 percent of the net jobs gained in the 43 states that gained jobs since 2000, which suggests that job growth in Texas may not be solely due to Perry's policies."}
