It relies on general statements and quotes from Marco Rubio without providing concrete proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Ted Cruz's involvement as a lawyer representing the Chinese company, such as fulfilling his professional duties or advocating for fair legal processes, which are not considered in the claim."}
