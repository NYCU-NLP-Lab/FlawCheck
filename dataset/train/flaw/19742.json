{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the incident by stating that a CPM worker posing as a Kerala policeman incited violence at Sabarimala.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that the person in the photograph is a CPM worker posing as a policeman.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person's hairstyle is evidence that he cannot be a police officer, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the possibility that the person in the photograph is actually a policeman and not a political worker, as confirmed by the Kerala police."}
