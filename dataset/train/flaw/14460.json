{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the events by stating that Thomas Fitzpatrick \"borrowed\" a plane, implying that he had permission to use it, when in fact he stole it.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the severity of Fitzpatrick's actions by describing them as a \"bar bet\" when he actually flew a stolen plane while intoxicated and without lights or radio.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify all the details, such as the exact nature of the original bet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Fitzpatrick's actions were solely motivated by a drunken bet, without considering other possible reasons for his actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Fitzpatrick's actions, such as mental health issues or reckless behavior unrelated to a bet."}
