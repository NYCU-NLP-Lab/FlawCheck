{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the United States has the third-highest rate of homicides worldwide.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that excluding four major cities would dramatically change the ranking of the United States in terms of homicide rates, without providing substantial evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Falters at times": "The claim is ambiguous and unclear about the specific metrics used to measure homicides, such as whether it includes all intentional homicides or just gun-related ones, and whether it refers to the murder rate or the absolute number of murders committed.", "Exaggerate": "The claim potentially exaggerates the ranking of the United States in terms of homicides by not providing accurate and comprehensive data. It implies that the United States is among the top three countries in terms of murders, which is not supported by reliable statistics.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts factual information provided by credible sources such as the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which rank the United States much lower in terms of intentional homicide rates compared to other countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of homicides in the United States, such as socio-economic factors, access to firearms, or other cultural and societal factors."}
