{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Libertarian Party of Georgia did not provide specific costs to back their claim about the proposed immigration bill bankrupting Georgia. Similarly, State Rep. Matt Ramsey, the lead sponsor of the legislation, did not have an estimate of the costs associated with it.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the impact of the immigration bill is complex and difficult to predict. This suggests that the claim may be based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the legislation resembles Arizona's HB 1070, which critics argue encourages racial profiling and infringes on federal authority. This alternative explanation suggests that the claim about the bill bankrupting Georgia may not be the only possible outcome of the legislation."}
