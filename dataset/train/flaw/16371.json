{"Understate": "The claim may understate the issue of low salaries for URI faculty by stating that they are only second to last among New England land grant universities and in the lowest 20 percent of major U.S. research institutions. The expert's verdict highlights that the situation is dire and salaries at URI are lower than all other New England institutions except for the University of Maine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement about salaries being second to last among New England land grant universities and in the lowest 20 percent of major U.S. research institutions. However, the expert's verdict mentions the authoritative annual survey by the AAUP, which provides data on average full-time salaries by position for various U.S. institutions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that low salaries at URI are solely due to underfunding by the state. While the expert's verdict mentions that officials at URI have complained about underfunding, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all factors contributing to the low salaries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the low salaries at URI. The expert's verdict only mentions underfunding as a possible cause but does not explore other factors that could contribute to the salary situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts or evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the issue of low salaries at URI. The expert's verdict supports the claim by providing evidence from the AAUP survey.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it consistently presents the issue of low salaries at URI. The expert's verdict also supports the claim by providing evidence from the AAUP survey."}
