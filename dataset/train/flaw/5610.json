{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or studies to support the effectiveness of drinking coconut water mixed with potassium aluminium sulphate in curing kidney stones.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that drinking coconut water mixed with potassium aluminium sulphate is a reliable and effective treatment for kidney stones without considering other medical treatments such as medication, shock wave lithotripsy, or surgery.", "Understate": "The claim may underestimate the potential side effects or risks associated with consuming potassium aluminium sulphate, as mentioned in the statement by Thailand's Department of Medical Science.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that while drinking coconut water may have some preventive effects against kidney stones, it is not a guaranteed cure for all types of kidney stones. Other medical treatments and lifestyle changes are also recommended to prevent the formation of kidney stones.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of providing clear and consistent information, as it has been shared on multiple platforms over the years, suggesting a lack of concrete evidence or consensus on its effectiveness.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement by Dr. Bamrungphuet, who states that the studies about the effectiveness of drinking coconut water in treating kidney stones are still unclear and cannot be used to cure all types of kidney stones.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the effectiveness of drinking coconut water mixed with potassium aluminium sulphate by presenting it as a definitive cure for kidney stones, without acknowledging the limitations or potential risks involved."}
