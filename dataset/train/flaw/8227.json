The expert's verdict suggests that recent operations have included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority under the previous administration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that recent immigration raids are causing fear in immigrant communities. While the expert's verdict does not directly address this assumption, it provides information about the nature of recent operations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the recent immigration raids. The expert's verdict provides information about the change in enforcement priorities under the Trump administration compared to the Obama administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that recent immigration raids are not business as usual and are being done indiscriminately.

The expert's verdict provides some information that contradicts or challenges the claim, but it does not necessarily indicate that the claim falters at times."}
