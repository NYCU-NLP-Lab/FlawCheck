The expert mentions that they couldn't find three other recent polls showing similar results.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cited polls accurately represent the overall trend and that there are no other polls contradicting the results. The expert mentions that Obama may have access to private polls that they haven't seen.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that there may be other factors influencing the poll results, such as sample size or demographics. The expert does not provide alternative explanations but acknowledges that there may be other polls with different results."}
