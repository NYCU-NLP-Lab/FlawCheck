{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration will be the first presidential inauguration that Rep. John Lewis has skipped, when in fact he had also skipped the inauguration of President George W. Bush in 2001.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to mention the previous inauguration that Rep. John Lewis had skipped, which undermines the accuracy of the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Rep. John Lewis skipping President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration is a significant event, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Rep. John Lewis's decision to skip the inauguration, such as his belief that President-elect Donald Trump is not a legitimate president due to alleged Russian interference in the election."}
