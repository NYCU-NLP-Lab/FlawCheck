{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that wearing masks is one of the most effective means of preventing the transmission of COVID-19, as supported by scientific studies and health researchers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the findings of the CDC report by suggesting that wearing masks increases the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, when the report actually found a correlation between regular mask wearing and lower transmission.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it misinterprets a survey from the CDC and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that wearing masks collects the virus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that wearing masks leads to the collection of the virus, without providing any scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the higher percentage of infected people wearing masks, such as the fact that mask-wearing individuals may be more cautious and exposed to higher-risk situations."}
