The expert's verdict mentions studies and advice from the CDC, but it does not directly address the assumption made in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to flu transmission. It solely focuses on the importance of handwashing and covering the mouth when coughing. The expert's verdict also does not mention any alternative explanations or factors that could impact flu transmission.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or information provided in the expert's verdict. The expert's verdict supports the general idea that handwashing and covering the mouth when coughing are important in reducing flu transmission.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may slightly exaggerate the impact of handwashing and covering the mouth in reducing flu transmission by stating that it \"makes a huge difference.\" The expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or statistics to support this level of impact."}
