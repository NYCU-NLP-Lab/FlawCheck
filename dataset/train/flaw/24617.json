{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Costco lied about carrying cage-free eggs in their stores.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the accusation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the undercover investigation by the Humane Society of the United States represents the entire egg supply at Costco, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of non-cage-free eggs at Costco, such as different suppliers or labeling errors."}
