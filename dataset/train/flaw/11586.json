The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a CDC report, but further refinement of statistics is needed to make a proper comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rise in e-cigarette use is solely responsible for erasing progress in reducing youth smoking.

The expert's verdict mentions that progress has been made in reducing youth smoking, but e-cigarette use has also increased significantly during the same period.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that progress has been made in reducing youth smoking. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the percentage of youth smokers has decreased over the years, despite the increase in e-cigarette use.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not acknowledging the complexities and nuances in the relationship between e-cigarette use and youth smoking. The expert's verdict highlights the need for refined statistics and proper comparisons to accurately assess the impact of e-cigarettes on reducing youth smoking."}
