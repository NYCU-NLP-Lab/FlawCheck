{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Michael Bloomberg referred to Donald Trump as a \"con artist\" and a \"cheat.\" While Bloomberg did criticize Trump's business practices and mock his acumen, he did not explicitly use those specific terms.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the statement that Donald Trump is known among millionaires as a \"con artist\" and among business owners as a \"cheat.\" The provided expert's verdict states that Bloomberg did not make the exact statement attributed to him.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the opinions of millionaires and business owners about Donald Trump are universally negative, which may not be accurate. The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Bloomberg's criticisms of Trump's business practices were taken out of context or exaggerated to portray Trump in a negative light. The claim does not consider other possible interpretations of Bloomberg's statements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bloomberg did not explicitly call Trump a \"con artist\" or a \"cheat\" as attributed in the claim. The expert's verdict confirms that the words in the claim were not spoken by Bloomberg.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misattributing words to Michael Bloomberg that he did not say. This shows a lack of accuracy and reliability in the claim."}
