{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Gwen Graham's role as a Washington lobbyist by implying that she actively participated in lobbying activities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Gwen Graham was a Washington lobbyist. The evidence provided only shows that she worked at a law firm that also did lobbying for some clients, but it does not establish her personal involvement in lobbying.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation presented by Gwen Graham's campaign, stating that her name being on disclosure forms does not prove her involvement in lobbying, as it was her employer who listed her name on the forms."}
