{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which requests for additional security were routinely denied by Hillary Clinton's State Department. While it is acknowledged that some requests were denied, it is not clear if it was a routine occurrence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied. While there is evidence of some denied requests, it is not clear if it was a routine or systematic denial.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the denial of requests for additional security was solely the responsibility of Hillary Clinton's State Department. It does not take into account other factors or agencies involved in the decision-making process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the denial of requests for additional security in Benghazi. It is possible that there were limitations in resources or conflicting priorities that influenced the decision-making process."}
