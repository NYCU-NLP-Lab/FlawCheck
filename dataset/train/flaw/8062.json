{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the New York law by stating that it is \"perfectly legal to murder\" a baby a minute before it would be born. The law allows for abortions after 24 weeks only in cases where the health or life of the mother is at risk or when there is an absence of fetal viability.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that the New York law allows for the murder of a baby a minute before birth. The expert's verdict provides information about the law and its provisions, which contradict the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the New York law permits the murder of a baby a minute before birth, without considering the specific circumstances and conditions under which late-term abortions are allowed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the New York law, such as the intention to align state law with the standards set by Roe vs. Wade or to ensure that women have access to necessary medical care within the state.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the New York law does not allow for the unrestricted murder of babies a minute before birth. The law has specific provisions regarding the circumstances under which late-term abortions are permitted.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times."}
