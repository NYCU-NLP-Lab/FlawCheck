{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the destruction of Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by stating that it has been destroyed, while the provided evidence only mentions it being defaced and destroyed twice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no credible source or evidence found online that corroborates the claim that Trump's star has been destroyed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image shared on Facebook, depicting the destruction of Trump's star, is accurate and recent. However, without credible sources, this assumption remains problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the image shared on Facebook is old or unrelated to recent events, and therefore does not accurately represent the current state of Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."}
