{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the fact that the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security. While it is true that life expectancy was lower in 1935, the claim may be overstating the extent to which people died before reaching Social Security age.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security. It is based on a statement made by Newt Gingrich without further verification or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of setting the retirement age at 65 was to deprive most people of receiving Social Security. However, experts and historical records suggest that the age was chosen based on practical considerations rather than a deliberate attempt to exclude people.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the retirement age was set at 65. It only focuses on the assumption that it was intended to limit the number of people receiving benefits, without exploring other possible reasons or factors that may have influenced the decision.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bill signed by President Roosevelt offered benefits to retirees when they turned 65. This indicates that the intention was to provide benefits to individuals who reached that age, rather than assuming that most people would not live long enough to receive them.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of increased life expectancy on the Social Security system. While it acknowledges that people are now living longer on Social Security, it does not fully address the implications and challenges this poses for the program.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information and opinions from different experts. While some sources support the claim made by Newt Gingrich, others provide alternative explanations and perspectives, creating uncertainty and ambiguity."}
