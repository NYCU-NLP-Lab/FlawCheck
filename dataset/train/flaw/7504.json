{"Exaggerate": "President Trump exaggerated the size of the defense budget by claiming it to be the \"most amount ever\" when it is not.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual amount of defense spending by only considering budget authority, which is different from budget outlays.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the defense spending next year will indeed be $716 billion, as it only provides information about budget authority.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that budget authority is equivalent to actual spending, which is not the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the claim, such as the fact that previous years had higher defense budget authority when adjusted for inflation."}
