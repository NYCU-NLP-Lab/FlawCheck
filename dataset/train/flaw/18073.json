{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person arrested, Nazir Mohammed, was dressed as a Sardarji in the farmers' strike in Haryana. However, this assumption is not supported by sufficient evidence or confirmation from reliable sources.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough evidence or support to prove that Nazir Mohammed, an SDPI worker, was indeed arrested and dressed as a Sardarji in the farmers' strike in Haryana.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it was previously debunked in 2019 when it was claimed that the person in the video was a Muslim impersonating as a member of the Sikh community. This suggests that the video may not be related to the current incident being described in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video in question is from 2011 and not from the current farmers' strike in Haryana."}
