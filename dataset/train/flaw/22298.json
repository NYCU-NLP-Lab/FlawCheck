However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the video is actually from 2016 and is being shared in the context of the new act.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the video, such as the possibility that it may not be related to the sharing of fines but rather to some other conflict or disagreement among the policemen. The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the video is related to the sharing of bribes collected from local vendors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from 2016 and not related to the new Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019. The expert's verdict provides the correct information and clarifies the context of the video."}
