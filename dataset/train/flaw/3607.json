{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the job of a correctional officer lowers life expectancy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a study conducted by Metropolitan in 1998 found a life expectancy of 58 for correctional officers, but there is no evidence or documentation to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's investigation found no credible sources or data to support the claim of a significantly lower life expectancy for correctional officers. Other studies and evidence suggest that correctional officers live nearly as long as other public employees.", "Understate": "The claim potentially understates the life expectancy of correctional officers by suggesting it is much lower than it actually is.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of studies that show correctional officers have a life expectancy similar to or slightly longer than other public employees.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing accurate and verifiable information, as the expert's investigation found no concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Exaggerate": "Although not explicitly stated in the expert's verdict, the claim may be considered an exaggeration as it suggests a significantly lower life expectancy for correctional officers without sufficient evidence."}
