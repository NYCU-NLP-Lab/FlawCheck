{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Dave Brat \"voted against protecting pre-existing conditions\" by implying that he completely opposed any form of protection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Dave Brat voted against protecting pre-existing conditions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting for the American Health Care Act, which would have changed Obamacare's rules on pre-existing conditions, equates to voting against protecting pre-existing conditions.
