It only provides one instance of a radio talk show host making this claim without any additional data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that popularity in a poll conducted by the Harvard-Harris Poll is an accurate representation of overall popularity among all Americans. However, it fails to consider other factors and alternative explanations for the poll results.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Bernie Sanders' popularity, such as regional or demographic biases that may have influenced the poll results. It presents the poll results as the sole determinant of his popularity without acknowledging other potential factors."}
