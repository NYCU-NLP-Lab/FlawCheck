{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a $930 million increase in education funding may be seen as an exaggeration, as the actual increase since Governor Deal took office is closer to $400 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the $930 million increase in education funding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in education funding is solely attributed to Governor Deal's administration without considering other factors or contributions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the claim, as it is mentioned that the $930 million figure includes a proposed increase in education spending by $547 million, which is the greatest single budgetary year increase in seven years."}
