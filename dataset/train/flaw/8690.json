{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Rep. Steve Pearce's alleged corruption by stating that he was \"twice named one of the most corrupt members of Congress by an independent watchdog group.\" The expert's verdict states that there is no basis in fact for this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Rep. Steve Pearce was cleared by the House Ethics Committee regarding the transaction mentioned in the corruption allegations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the findings of a watchdog group with a Democratic tilt, and their interpretation of the law requiring disclosure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being named on a list of \"most corrupt\" members automatically implies guilt, without considering the clearance from the House Ethics Committee.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the corruption claims against Rep. Steve Pearce were discredited eight years ago and that the ad revives long-discredited claims."}
