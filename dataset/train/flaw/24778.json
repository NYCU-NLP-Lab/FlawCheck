{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came from outside of the country. The expert's analysis indicates that the claim is based on data that has limitations and includes nonviolent offenses, such as fraud or immigration violations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it relies on an analysis conducted by a congressional subcommittee, rather than an official report from the Department of Justice itself. The data used in the analysis also had limitations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses are primarily foreign-born, which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's analysis suggests that many of the convictions were for threats that were not planned or carried out on U.S. soil.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the convictions, such as the possibility that some individuals may have been radicalized within the country. The expert's analysis indicates that the claim focuses on the origin of individuals convicted, but does not provide information on their immigration history or whether they were radicalized abroad."}
