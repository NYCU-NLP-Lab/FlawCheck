The expert's verdict provides some information from a Miami Herald article, but it does not provide additional sources or details to corroborate or expand upon the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Charlie Crist's opposition to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006 is relevant or indicative of his current stance on the issue. The expert's verdict does not explicitly address this assumption, but it provides context about the current political climate and the potential motivations for supporting or opposing the bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Charlie Crist's opposition to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006. The expert's verdict mentions that the proposal divided Republican legislators and drew opposition from Senate President Tom Lee, suggesting that there were multiple factors influencing the outcome of the bill."}
