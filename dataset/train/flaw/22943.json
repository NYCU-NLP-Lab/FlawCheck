{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of prochoice members in the House of Representatives by claiming that there is not a prochoice majority, while the evidence suggests that there are at least 185 prochoice members according to NARAL Pro-Choice America's ratings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion that the House of Representatives does not have a prochoice majority.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the fact that not every member falls neatly into a prochoice or antichoice category.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the composition of the House of Representatives, such as political dynamics, individual beliefs, or regional differences, which are not explored in the claim."}
