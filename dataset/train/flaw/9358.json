McAuliffe indicating his ambition to be in Clinton's Cabinet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gov. McAuliffe's restoration of voting rights to felons is solely motivated by his desire to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency. This assumption is problematic as it overlooks other potential reasons for the restoration order.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Gov. McAuliffe's restoration of voting rights to felons, such as a belief in criminal justice reform or a commitment to second chances. However, the claim does not consider these possibilities."}
