{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of support from Turkish leader Erdogan for Indonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto. The image used in the claim is doctored to make it appear as if Erdogan is showing support, when in reality it is a different person making the gesture.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Erdogan actually declared support for Prabowo Subianto. The only evidence provided is a doctored image, which is not reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the two-fingered pointing gesture made by Subianto and Uno during their campaign is a sign of support from Erdogan. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the two-fingered pointing gesture made by Subianto and Uno, other than it being a sign of support from Erdogan. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
