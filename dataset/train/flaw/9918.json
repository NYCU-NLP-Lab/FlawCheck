{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Trump's alleged IQ score of 73 by stating that it is just a couple of points away from being \"intellectually disabled\" and far below the average IQ score of 100.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support for the alleged IQ test results. It is based on a fake newspaper clipping and a story from an unnamed source.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged IQ test results are accurate and valid, without providing any verifiable proof or documentation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert highlights that there is no public record of presidential IQ scores and that assigning IQ numbers to presidents has been a subject of conjecture. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations or interpretations of Trump's intelligence or cognitive abilities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no official or publicly available IQ score for President Donald Trump.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable information about Trump's alleged IQ test results, as it is based on a fake newspaper clipping and an unverified story from an unnamed source.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and validity of IQ tests by presenting a single score as a definitive measure of intelligence, without considering other factors or limitations associated with IQ testing."}
