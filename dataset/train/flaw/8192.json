{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as an exaggeration because it states that John McCain was no longer a U.S. Senator as of July 2017, without providing substantial evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article which makes the claim does not provide any evidence or proof to support the headline's claim that McCain had left office. This lack of supporting evidence indicates a bias.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict suggests that the article's headline is click-bait and may have been plagiarized, indicating a problematic assumption that the information presented is not reliable or accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that McCain underwent brain surgery in July 2017, which could be an alternative explanation for his absence from the Senate, rather than him no longer being a senator. This indicates the presence of an alternative explanation bias.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article consists entirely of material copied and pasted from a previous opinion piece, which suggests that the information presented may lack originality and reliability, indicating a bias of faltering at times."}
