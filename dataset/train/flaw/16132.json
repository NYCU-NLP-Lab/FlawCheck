The expert's verdict mentions that there were queries from readers who were unsure if the ban applied to all DoubleTree properties.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sign displayed at the DoubleTree Hotel in Colorado Springs represents a policy of not serving military personnel and their guests. However, the expert's verdict states that the sign was put on display by two employees after an event and was later removed. It does not indicate that it was a company-wide policy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the sign being displayed, such as miscommunication or misunderstanding between the hotel staff and the event organizers. The expert's verdict does not provide conclusive evidence of the motive behind displaying the sign.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the context and circumstances surrounding the incident. The expert's verdict mentions that the sign was displayed after an event involving military members and that the hotel staff started blocking access to the grog. However, it does not provide further details or evidence to fully understand the situation.", "Contradict fact": "There is no indication in the expert's verdict that the claim contradicts any established facts. The photograph and accompanying narrative are deemed genuine and accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing a clear and complete understanding of the incident. The expert's verdict mentions incomplete or inaccurate information being shared on social media and queries from readers who were unsure about the extent of the ban on military personnel at DoubleTree properties."}
