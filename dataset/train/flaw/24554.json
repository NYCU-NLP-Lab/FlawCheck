{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the expansion of the prison population and the increase in correctional officer vacancies over the last eight years. The expert's verdict provides data that shows a growth in both, but it does not specify the magnitude of the expansion or increase.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the extent of the expansion in the prison population and correctional officer vacancies. The expert's verdict provides some data, but it may not be sufficient to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the expansion of the prison population and the increase in correctional officer vacancies are directly related and caused by neglect over the last eight years. The expert's verdict does not provide a clear causal link between the two factors.", "Alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the expansion of the prison population and the increase in correctional officer vacancies. The expert's verdict mentions factors such as problems at specific facilities and the state's low unemployment rate as potential contributing factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the data and evidence. The expert's verdict points out that while the claim is generally on track with the prison population data, it may not provide a complete picture of the situation."}
