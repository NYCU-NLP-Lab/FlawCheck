{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of infants killed by the MMR vaccine, as there is no precise data available on deaths caused by the vaccine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the MMR vaccine kills 445 infants in one year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of deaths caused by measles is significantly lower than the number caused by the MMR vaccine, without considering the global impact of measles and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that measles cases have been on the rise in the United States, with the second-highest number of cases reported since 2000.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using outdated information from a blog post that does not mention measles to support its argument.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of deaths caused by measles globally and the historical impact of measles epidemics before the introduction of the vaccine."}
