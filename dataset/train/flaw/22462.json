{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Girl Scouts' curriculum promotes Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan as icons for children to emulate. The expert's verdict clarifies that the promotion of these figures occurred via social media and not directly in the curriculum.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that promoting Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan as icons automatically means promoting their pro-abortion stance. The expert's verdict does not provide enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the Girl Scouts' curriculum actively promotes Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan as icons. The evidence provided only shows that their speeches are mentioned on a blog linked on a Pinterest page for Girl Scout Cadettes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan are mentioned in the Girl Scouts' social media. It is possible that they are mentioned for their contributions to women's rights or other aspects of their work, rather than solely for their stance on abortion."}
