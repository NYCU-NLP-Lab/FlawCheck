{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photograph shows Ted Cruz hugging Fidel Castro is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the photograph is fake and based on a different image.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or additional information provided to substantiate the assertion that the photograph shows Ted Cruz hugging Fidel Castro.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph of Ted Cruz and Fidel Castro is fake and that similar photoshopped images have been created with other individuals, such as George W. Bush. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the existence of the photograph.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication of the claim or expert's verdict faltering at times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is genuine and depicts Ted Cruz hugging Fidel Castro, which is a problematic assumption as the expert's verdict concludes that the photograph is fake.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases listed (Falters at times, Exaggerate, Understate) are applicable in this case."}
