{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the statement made by BJP leaders. While there were provocative slogans and allegations made, the specific statement about Shaheen Bagh protestors entering homes and raping women and daughters was denied by Home Minister Amit Shah.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that no BJP leader made the statement about Shaheen Bagh protestors. Although Home Minister Amit Shah denied the statement, there is evidence of BJP MP Parvesh Verma making a similar statement in a video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that while Home Minister Amit Shah denied the specific statement about Shaheen Bagh protestors, there is evidence of another BJP leader, Parvesh Verma, making a similar statement. This suggests that at least one BJP leader did make such a statement, contradicting the claim."}
