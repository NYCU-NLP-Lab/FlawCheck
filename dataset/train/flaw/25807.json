The expert's verdict provides evidence that the claim is based on misquotations and misrepresentations of McCain's actual statements.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or context for McCain's remarks. The expert's verdict highlights the need to examine the full context of McCain's remarks to determine their accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that McCain's statement about a potential long-term U.S. commitment in Iraq translates to the war lasting for another 100 years. The expert's verdict suggests that this assumption is not accurate and that McCain's remarks have been misrepresented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for McCain's statement, such as the possibility that he was referring to a non-combat presence or a long-term security partnership. The expert's verdict indicates that McCain has elaborated on his remarks, suggesting that there may be alternative interpretations."}
