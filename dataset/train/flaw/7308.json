{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the violations by stating that they only involve exterior issues and that \"within the households, it's fine.\" However, the expert's verdict reveals that there are numerous violations, including interior issues, and that there are 200 outstanding violations on eight of the properties.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are violations beyond just exterior issues. The expert's verdict states that some of the violations listed include interior issues such as trashing an apartment.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about the violations. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides specific information about the violations, including the number of outstanding violations and examples of properties and violations listed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the violations are not significant or problematic within the households, but this assumption is not supported by evidence or further explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the violations or address any potential underlying issues. The expert's verdict provides additional context, such as the high number of police calls to Holloway-owned buildings, which suggests that there may be more significant problems beyond just the building code violations."}
