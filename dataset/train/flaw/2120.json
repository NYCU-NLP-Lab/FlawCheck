{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Kavanaugh's argument by stating that he argued that disabled people could be forced to have elective surgeries, including abortions. The expert's verdict clarifies that Kavanaugh's ruling did not involve abortion and that the claim presents an oversimplified representation of the case.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Kavanaugh argued for forcing disabled people to have elective surgeries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Kavanaugh's ruling on the case involving the D.C. disability services officials directly translates to him arguing for forced elective surgeries on disabled individuals. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the case did not pertain to specific medical procedures but rather to the injunction itself.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for Kavanaugh's ruling, stating that he supported reversing a lower court ruling that found D.C.'s standard to be unconstitutional and ordered a different process for ascertaining the wishes of patients in cases of intellectual incapacitation."}
