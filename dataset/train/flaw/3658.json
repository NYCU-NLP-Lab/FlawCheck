{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Trump's removal from social media platforms by stating that he \"can't say anything\" about the Capitol riot.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or examples to back up the assertion that Trump is unable to speak out due to being removed from social media platforms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's removal from social media platforms is the sole reason for his inability to speak out about the Capitol riot, without considering other means of communication available to him.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative means of communication for Trump, such as hosting press briefings, releasing statements, going on TV, and talking to reporters. This contradicts the claim's assumption that Trump is completely silenced due to being removed from social media platforms."}
