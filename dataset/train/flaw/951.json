{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats made a promise to their left-wing base to impeach the president even before he took office. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Pelosi and Schiff resisted calls for impeachment and were not involved in such promises.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that Pelosi, Schiff, and other Democrats made a promise to impeach the president before he took office. The expert's verdict provides evidence contradicting this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pelosi, Schiff, and other Democrats were corrupt and made promises to impeach the president before he took office. This assumption is not supported by evidence and is subjective in nature.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that there were discussions and talks about the possibility of impeaching the president, but this does not equate to a promise made by Pelosi, Schiff, and other Democrats. The expert's verdict provides examples of Democrats raising the possibility of impeachment, but not promising to do so."}
