{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively conclude that the high volume of Americans researching immigrating to Canada caused the temporary crash of the country's immigration site. The evidence provided only shows a correlation between the spike in searches and the site experiencing delays.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the spike in searches for immigrating to Canada was solely caused by the Super Tuesday results and the popularity of Donald Trump. However, there could be other factors contributing to the increase in searches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the temporary crash of the immigration site. The claim does not consider other possible reasons for the site's technical difficulties, such as server issues or high traffic unrelated to immigrating to Canada.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Google Trends data showed a spike in searches related to moving from the U.S. to Canada on Super Tuesday. However, it does not provide concrete evidence to directly link this spike to the temporary crash of the immigration site."}
