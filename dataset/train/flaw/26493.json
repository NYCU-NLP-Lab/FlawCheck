{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because there are conflicting reports and changing information regarding whether immigrants were required to pay for DNA tests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it is unknown whether any immigrants actually paid out-of-pocket for DNA tests or if the government paid for such testing.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the Trump administration made immigrants pay $800 for DNA tests, when it is unclear if any payments were actually required.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the government workers may have initially informed immigrants that they would have to pay for DNA tests, but the government later changed course and promised to pay for any necessary testing."}
