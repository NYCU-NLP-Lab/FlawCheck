{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of supervisors of elections in Florida who refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls by stating that \"every one of the 67 supervisors of elections\" refused to do so.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or support to back up the statement that all 67 supervisors of elections refused to carry out the effort.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the refusal of the supervisors of elections is due to the alleged racist nature of the voter purge targeting Latino voters, without providing evidence or alternative explanations for their refusal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore or provide alternative explanations for why the supervisors of elections may have refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, such as legal or logistical reasons.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state government did not send all 180,000 names to the local supervisors, but rather a smaller subset of 2,600 potential noncitizens, which undermines the claim that all supervisors refused to carry out the effort.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making broad generalizations about the actions of all supervisors of elections without providing specific evidence or examples.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
