{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that a blow to the testicles can kill a man. The expert mentions a few isolated cases but acknowledges that more serious complications and exacerbating factors need to be considered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a blow to the testicles can result in death without providing substantial evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that other factors, such as underlying conditions or specific extenuating circumstances, may contribute to any potential deaths related to testicular trauma. This indicates that there could be alternative explanations for such incidents.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict understates the potential severity of a blow to the testicles by mentioning that more serious complications can arise with enough force. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the potential lethality of such an injury.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that it is impossible to say what exactly happened in the reported cases of death resulting from testicular injury. This contradicts the claim's assertion that a blow to the testicles can kill a man.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict falters at times by speculating about potential underlying conditions or factors that may have contributed to the reported deaths. This indicates a lack of certainty or conclusive evidence."}
