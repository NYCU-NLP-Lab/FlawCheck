{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the frequency of new prisons being built, as it states \"a new prison every 10 days\" without specifying whether it refers to state or federal prisons.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the growth of prisons by only focusing on the period between 1990 and 2005, as there was a significant increase in facilities even before 1990.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by data on the increase in the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities, it does not provide specific evidence for the \"mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders\" part of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in prison construction was solely to accommodate nonviolent offenders, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the prison growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the increase in prison construction, such as changes in sentencing laws or policies."}
