{"Exaggerate": "The claim that mortgage fraud is \"up 400 percent in the last five years\" may be an exaggeration, as the FBI's own report shows a slightly lower percentage increase.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by FBI statistics and a Department of Treasury fraud report, the expert's verdict does not provide additional evidence or sources to further support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a 400 percent increase in mortgage fraud is outrageous, without providing any context or comparison to other types of fraud or crimes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore or present alternative explanations for the increase in mortgage fraud, such as changes in reporting or enforcement methods."}
