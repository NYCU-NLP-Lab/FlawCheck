{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the health care overhaul by stating that \"14 million Americans lose coverage\" in year No. 1. The CBO report projects a reduction in coverage, but the claim does not provide enough context to determine if it is an exaggeration.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the health care overhaul by only mentioning the loss of coverage for 14 million Americans in year No. 1. The CBO report also projects a decrease in coverage over the long term.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough supporting evidence or data to fully evaluate the statement that \"14 million Americans lose coverage.\" More information is needed to determine the basis for this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the projected decrease in coverage, such as the repeal of the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in coverage is solely due to the health care overhaul, without considering other factors that may contribute to changes in insurance enrollment."}
