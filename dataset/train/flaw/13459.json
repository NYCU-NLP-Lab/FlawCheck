{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Oregon schools are required to spend their federal school lunch assistance money outside of Oregon. While the claim states that they are required to spend the money \"almost anywhere but Oregon,\" the article suggests that the program in question supplies only 20% of the food used in school nutrition programs.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Oregon schools are required to spend their federal school lunch assistance money outside of Oregon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that Oregon schools are required to spend their federal school lunch assistance money almost anywhere but Oregon.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that using local food sources would be cheaper and more nutritious, without providing evidence to support this assumption. It also assumes that the current system of purchasing food for school lunch programs is haphazard and inefficient.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Oregon schools may be required to spend their federal school lunch assistance money outside of Oregon, such as cost considerations, availability of certain food items, or contractual agreements with suppliers."}
