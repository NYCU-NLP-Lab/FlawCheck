{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high, as there have been higher levels of funding in the past when adjusted for inflation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully credit President Obama for the funding levels, as the funding framework was set by the Bush administration before Obama took office.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that U.S. security funding for Israel is solely determined by the actions of President Obama, without considering the role of previous administrations and other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in funding, such as the negotiated funding framework set by the Bush administration."}
