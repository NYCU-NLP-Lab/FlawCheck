{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that \"NOT A MASK IN SITE\" at John Lewis' funeral, when in fact, there were people wearing masks, including Bill Clinton himself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that no one was wearing masks at the funeral. There are multiple sources and photographs that show people wearing masks, contradicting the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Bill Clinton was wearing a mask while seated in the pews during the funeral, as confirmed by the expert's investigation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo showing Bill Clinton without a mask was taken at John Lewis' funeral, when in reality, it was a photo from a different funeral five years prior. This assumption is problematic and misleading.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the photo showing Bill Clinton without a mask is not from John Lewis' funeral but from a different event altogether."}
