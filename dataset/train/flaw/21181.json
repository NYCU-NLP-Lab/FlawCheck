{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that in just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care, and interest on the debt will exceed ALL tax revenue. This may be an exaggeration as it assumes the worst-case scenario and does not consider potential policy changes or economic factors.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on assumptions and projections made by the Congressional Budget Office. These projections are based on certain policy scenarios and may not accurately predict future outcomes.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim references figures published by the Congressional Budget Office, it does not provide additional evidence or data to support the assertion that spending will exceed tax revenue in 17 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Congress will lack the courage to continue unpopular budget policies and will increase spending while reducing taxes. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the potential for policy changes or fiscal reforms.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that there is an alternative scenario presented by the Congressional Budget Office, which assumes different policy decisions by Congress. This alternative scenario suggests that spending will exceed taxes in 2031, rather than 2044 as stated in the claim."}
