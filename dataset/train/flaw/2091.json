{"Understate": "The claim suggests that Democrats in Congress have not taken any action to make waterboarding illegal or change the law. However, the expert's verdict highlights that Democrats did pass legislation in 2008 to outlaw waterboarding, but it was vetoed by President George W. Bush.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Democrats have not taken any action to address waterboarding. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the legislation passed by Democrats in 2008, which contradicts the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the presidential veto as the reason why the Democrats' efforts to make waterboarding illegal were not successful. The expert's verdict points out that the Democrats did try to pass a law, but it was stopped by the veto.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Democrats did pass legislation in 2008 to restrict U.S. agents to interrogation methods outlined in the Army Field Manual, which specifically forbids waterboarding. The claim's assertion that Democrats have not taken any action is not supported by this fact.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the inaction of Democrats in Congress by stating that they \"haven't gone into any of these things and changed law.\" This exaggeration ignores the Democrats' efforts to pass legislation and the subsequent veto by President Bush.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the efforts made by Democrats in Congress to address waterboarding, even though their attempts were ultimately unsuccessful due to the presidential veto."}
