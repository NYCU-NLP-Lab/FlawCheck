{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s had a broader provision in favor of the corporate right to back out of providing contraceptive coverage compared to the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. The expert's verdict mentions that Gingrich's statement refers to a provision in a separate bill sponsored by Moynihan, which was not part of the Clintons' plan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Clinton's health care plan had a broader provision in favor of the corporate right to back out of providing contraceptive coverage. The expert's verdict mentions that Gingrich's statement is based on a provision in a separate bill, and it is not clear if this provision was included in Clinton's plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gingrich's statement accurately represents the provisions of Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Gingrich's statement refers to a provision in a separate bill, and it is not clear if this provision was part of Clinton's plan.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the similarities between Clinton's health care plan and the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. The expert's verdict mentions that both the court decision and Clinton's plan were influenced by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows certain corporations to opt out of providing contraception coverage based on religious beliefs."}
