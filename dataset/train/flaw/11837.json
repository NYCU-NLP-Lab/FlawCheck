{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Obama/Biden administration on Wisconsin dairy farms, stating that they were \"decimated\" when in reality, the decline in dairy farms was due to market forces and a long-term consolidation trend.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the statement that dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by at least 100% under the USMCA. No evidence or data is provided to back up this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that dairy prices and the decline in dairy farms are primarily influenced by market forces, not the actions of specific administrations.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in dairy farms in Wisconsin was solely due to the Obama/Biden administration, ignoring other factors such as market forces and long-term consolidation trends.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The experts provide alternative explanations for the decline in dairy farms, such as cyclical milk prices, consolidation trends, and the expansion of dairy farms leading to surplus milk and reduced profitability.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, stating that dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by at least 100%. However, the International Trade Commission estimated a much smaller increase in dairy exports to Canada under the agreement."}
