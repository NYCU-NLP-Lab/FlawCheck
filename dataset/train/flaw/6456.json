{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the photograph by suggesting that it was taken in November 2018, when it was actually taken in 2009.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the photograph shows President Obama visiting Arlington National Cemetery alone in the rain.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photograph was taken in 2009, not in November 2018 as suggested.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is relevant to President Trump's controversial decision to skip an event commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, without providing any evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for why the photograph was shared on social media, such as nostalgia or admiration for President Obama."}
