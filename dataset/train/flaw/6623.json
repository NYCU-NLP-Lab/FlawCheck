{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the level of support for voter photo ID legislation by stating that 70% of Missourians support it without providing enough evidence or clarifying the details of the proposed legislation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites one poll conducted by Remington Research, which does not clarify the definition of \"valid identification\" and the specific details of the proposed legislation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the support for voter photo ID legislation is high among Missourians based on the poll cited, without considering the potential biases or limitations of the poll.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the level of support, such as the influence of political affiliation or the potential impact on minority and poor voters, as mentioned by Democrats."}
