{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the protest against Piyush Goyal by railway employees. The only evidence provided is a video that is two years old and does not establish a recent protest.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the protest shown in the video is against Piyush Goyal, the incumbent Minister of Railways, without providing any concrete evidence or statements from the protesters themselves.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is from November 2018, which debunks the claim that the protest is recent.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the video is two years old and has resurfaced as recent, misleading viewers into believing that railway employees are currently protesting against Piyush Goyal.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the protest shown in the video, such as it being against a different issue or a different politician, but these are not explored or investigated in the claim."}
