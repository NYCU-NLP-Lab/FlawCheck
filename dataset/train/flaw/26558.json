{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Milwaukee has the second-highest number of children recovered from sex trafficking. The expert's verdict mentions specific cases and enforcement actions but does not provide comprehensive data or statistics to back up the claim.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were reasons to believe Milwaukee might be one of the worst places for child sex trafficking, but it does not provide a consistent or strong argument throughout. The information provided is fragmented and does not present a cohesive case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of children recovered from sex trafficking is a reliable indicator of the prevalence of child sex trafficking in Milwaukee. However, the expert's verdict points out that the results of one enforcement action do not establish Milwaukee as having the second-highest child sex trafficking recoveries in the nation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that child sex trafficking is common in communities across the country, not just in urban areas. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the number of children recovered from sex trafficking in Milwaukee, such as law enforcement efforts or specific enforcement actions."}
