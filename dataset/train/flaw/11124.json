{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Ted Budd \"voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions\" and that he allowed insurance companies to deny coverage for necessary treatment. While his vote did open the door for insurers to hike premiums for those with pre-existing conditions under certain circumstances, it did not completely eliminate protections or allow denial of coverage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that Ted Budd's vote would result in insurance companies denying coverage for necessary treatment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ted Budd's vote on the American Health Care Act of 2017 directly translates to gutting protections for pre-existing conditions and allowing insurance companies to deny coverage. However, the AHCA did not explicitly allow denial of coverage and had provisions to address pre-existing conditions, although it did open the possibility for higher premiums.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Ted Budd's vote was based on his support for the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare, rather than a deliberate intention to gut protections for pre-existing conditions or deny coverage for necessary treatment."}
