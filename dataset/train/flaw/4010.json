{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered as exaggerating the situation by stating that the photo shows Donald Trump with Derek Chauvin, the cop who killed George Floyd. The expert's verdict mentions that the photo adds another layer to Chauvin's history, but it does not confirm that Chauvin is in the photo.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no concrete evidence or confirmation that the person identified as Derek Chauvin in the photo is actually him. The expert's verdict mentions that a Fox News affiliate reported that neither Chauvin nor the other three officers were present at the campaign rally shown in the photo.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person identified as Derek Chauvin in the photo is indeed him, without providing any solid evidence. The expert's verdict mentions that Lt. Bob Kroll, who is standing next to the person in the photo, stated that it is a different officer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the person identified as Derek Chauvin in the photo may not be him. The expert's verdict mentions that Lt. Bob Kroll, who is standing next to the person in the photo, stated that it is a different officer."}
