{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the incident by stating that a flyover collapsed, when in fact it was a concrete beam that collapsed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the incident actually occurred on the Balanagar-Jeedimetla route.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video showing the collapsed beam is related to the Balanagar-Jeedimetla route, without providing substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the incident took place in Thane, Maharashtra, but there is evidence to suggest that the video is from a different location (Varanasi) and a different time (2018).", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statements made by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) and Thane City Police, who both denied that the incident occurred in their respective areas.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by sharing the same video multiple times with different claims about the location of the incident, which raises doubts about its accuracy and reliability."}
