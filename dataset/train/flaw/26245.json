{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the influence of one superdelegate vote by stating that it is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists. The expert's verdict suggests that this claim is being used to illustrate the power of superdelegates over the New Hampshire primary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that one superdelegate vote is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists. The expert's verdict mentions that the actual math involved is simple, but it does not provide any calculations or evidence to support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the influence of one superdelegate vote can be accurately equated to the influence of 10,000 grassroots activists. This assumption may not take into account the complexities and nuances of the political process and the different roles that superdelegates and grassroots activists play.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the role and influence of superdelegates in the Democratic Party's nomination process. The expert's verdict mentions that superdelegates are allowed to back whichever candidate they want, and that Hillary Clinton has received a significant number of endorsements from superdelegates. This suggests that there may be factors other than the primary results that contribute to the influence of superdelegates."}
