{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of missing the inauguration, as it implies that it is the first one missed since being in Congress, but there is evidence that Rep. John Lewis also missed President George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or context to support the statement that missing the inauguration is significant or unprecedented.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as evidence suggests that Rep. John Lewis has previously missed an inauguration before, which contradicts the claim that it is the first one missed since being in Congress."}
