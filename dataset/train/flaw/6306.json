There is no evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that no evidence could be found to support the claim that military commanders have publicly stated they would not follow certain orders from Trump.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that military commanders have already stated their refusal to follow certain orders from Trump, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that while some senior Republican national security officials signed a letter criticizing Trump's fitness for office, the letter did not explicitly state that they would personally refuse or encourage active commanders to refuse an illegal order from Trump. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for their criticism.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no evidence to support the assertion that military commanders have already stated their refusal to follow certain orders from Trump."}
