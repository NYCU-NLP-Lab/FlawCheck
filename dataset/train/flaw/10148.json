{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that \"all real estate transactions\" will be subject to a 3.8% sales tax, when in reality it only applies to high earners who make more than a certain income threshold.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax on investment income from real estate transactions is equivalent to a sales tax on all real estate transactions, which is a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that the health care law includes a 3.8% sales tax on all real estate transactions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the tax on investment income, such as the fact that it is intended to fund Medicare and applies only to high earners."}
