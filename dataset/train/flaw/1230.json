{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the decline in the ratio of workers to retirees in Social Security. While it is true that the ratio has decreased, the claim presents it as a more drastic decline than it actually is.", "Understate": "The claim understates the historical context and changes in society that led to the government assuming responsibility for certain social welfare programs. It simplifies the issue by solely blaming government involvement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement about the future ratio of workers to retirees. It does not provide any specific information or sources to back up this prediction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in the ratio of workers to retirees in Social Security is solely due to government programs and does not consider other factors such as changes in demographics or economic conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in the ratio of workers to retirees, such as changes in birth rates or increased life expectancy, which can also impact the sustainability of Social Security."}
