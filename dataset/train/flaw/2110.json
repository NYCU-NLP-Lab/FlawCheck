{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the lawsuits considered in the analysis were not exclusively about Trump and some were not related to the general presidential election at all.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on an analysis that includes lawsuits dating back to March 2020, not exclusively related to the 2020 presidential election.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that winning cases on their merits equates to overall success in challenging the election results, without considering the number of cases filed and dismissed on procedural grounds.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that just because a case is dismissed on procedural grounds does not mean it wasn't duly considered, as pointed out by experts.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that none of the lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters have proven there was fraud, and judges from various political backgrounds have rejected their cases.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the success of Trump in election-related lawsuits by stating that he won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts, without providing a comprehensive picture of the total number of cases filed and their outcomes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting a misleading impression that Trump won several election-related lawsuits on their merits, while only one case cited in the article was decided after November 3rd."}
