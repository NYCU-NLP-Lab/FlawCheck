{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the prediction made by Steve Bannon by stating that multiple members of Obama's administration, and possibly Obama himself, would be in federal prison by the end of Trump's first term. This prediction did not come true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a meme image that was not created by Steve Bannon and was shared on social media. The image was not genuine and there is no evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that members of Obama's administration would be in federal prison by the end of Trump's first term. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or factual basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the prediction made by Steve Bannon or the reasons behind it. It simply presents the claim without any context or analysis."}
