{"Lack enough support": "The claim of \"lowest unemployment rate for minorities ever\" lacks enough support because the historical data for minorities only starts in the 1970s for Blacks and Hispanics and in 2000 for Asians.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the unemployment rate for minorities under Trump was the lowest ever, without considering the possibility that it may have been lower in the late 1960s or during World War II, as suggested by economists.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the unemployment rates for minorities were almost certainly lower at the end of the 1960s and during WWII, according to economists.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the overall unemployment rate in the 1950s and 60s, when data for minorities was not recorded, reached its lowest level, suggesting that the claim of \"lowest ever\" may not be accurate for all groups.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the historical unemployment rates for minorities by asserting that they were the lowest ever under Trump, without considering the possibility of lower rates in the past.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Trump's presidency on minority unemployment rates by asserting that they were the lowest ever, without acknowledging that historical data is limited and comparisons with previous periods are difficult.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by selectively presenting data for certain minority groups (such as Black or African American men) during specific time periods, without providing a comprehensive analysis of unemployment rates for all minority groups throughout history."}
