{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the efforts and plans already in place by the Trump administration to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. The expert's verdict highlights the establishment of Operation Warp Speed, the involvement of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, as well as the formation of committees to help with vaccine distribution planning.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or support to substantiate its assertion that the president should have started planning for vaccine distribution three months ago. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information about the ongoing efforts and plans already in place.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the president has not taken any action or appointed someone to plan for vaccine distribution, which may not be accurate. The expert's verdict highlights the appointment of Army Gen. Gustave Perna as the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the existing plans and efforts already in place by the Trump administration, as mentioned in the expert's verdict. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the current state of vaccine distribution planning."}
