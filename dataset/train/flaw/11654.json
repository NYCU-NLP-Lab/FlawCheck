{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which other Massachusetts governors have erased electronic communications, as there is no evidence provided to support this comparison.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of Romney's staff erasing electronic communications, as it is mentioned that Patrick's staff has been unable to meet public records requests as a result.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples of other Massachusetts governors erasing electronic communications.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make the problematic assumption that following the precedent of other Massachusetts governors and state law justifies erasing electronic communications, without considering the potential ethical implications or public interest in preserving these records.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for why Romney's staff erased electronic communications, such as potential attempts to hide or protect certain information."}
