{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of criminals living illegally in the U.S., stating that there are \"probably 2 million\" or \"even 3 million\" when the estimate is actually around 820,000.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the claim of there being \"2 million\" or \"3 million\" criminals.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all \"criminal aliens\" mentioned in the DHS report are living in the U.S. illegally, when in fact, the term includes both legal and illegal immigrants who have been convicted of a crime.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that many of the \"criminal aliens\" mentioned in the report are actually living in the U.S. legally, as stated by the Migration Policy Institute."}
