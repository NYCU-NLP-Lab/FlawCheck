{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of refugees that Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in, stating that it would be 620,000 in her first term alone.", "Understate": "The claim understates the information provided by Hillary Clinton, as she has only talked about the number of refugees that should have been admitted for a single year, not for her entire first term.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that there is no effective way to screen or vet the refugees that would be brought in under Clinton's plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Clinton would bring in 155,000 refugees each fiscal year, totaling 620,000 in four years, without concrete evidence or confirmation from Clinton's campaign.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that Clinton's plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs, as the specific dollar amount is not specified on her immigration reform page."}
