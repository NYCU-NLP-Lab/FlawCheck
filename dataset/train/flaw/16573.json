{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Tom Arnold has unused footage that captures racist utterances from Donald Trump. This claim may be seen as exaggerated as it implies that there is definitive evidence of racist utterances without providing concrete proof.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that Tom Arnold possesses unused footage of racist utterances from Donald Trump. The expert's verdict mentions that Arnold claims to have the recordings but does not provide any concrete evidence to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the unused footage from \"The Apprentice\" captures racist utterances from Donald Trump. This assumption is problematic as it is based on Tom Arnold's claims without providing any evidence or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Tom Arnold's claims, such as personal bias or motivations for making such statements. The expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations for Arnold's claims, but it leaves room for skepticism by mentioning that he has not released the material and provides a possible reason for his hesitation."}
