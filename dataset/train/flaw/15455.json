{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual promise made by Joe Biden, as the expert's verdict states that Biden did not literally promise fewer fires, floods, and hurricanes as some media headlines suggested.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden made a promise to reduce fires, floods, and hurricanes if elected, which is not supported by the expert's verdict."}
