{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support from credible sources, as the supposed study from the \"University of Harvard\" does not exist and the lead researcher, Marc Wildemberg, has no web presence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between watching \"Peppa Pig\" and developing autism, without considering other factors or potential alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific consensus and established research on the causes of autism, as there is no evidence to support a link between watching a specific TV show and developing autism.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of watching \"Peppa Pig\" by stating that it increases the probability of developing autism by 56% without reliable evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider other potential factors that could contribute to the development of autism, such as genetic predisposition or environmental influences."}
