{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that youth unemployment in Nigeria is \"almost 70%\", which implies a very high rate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to validate the assertion of nearly 70% youth unemployment.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that youth unemployment in Nigeria is reaching 70%, without providing clear justification or evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the unemployment situation in Nigeria, which are not addressed in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not seem to understate the youth unemployment rate in Nigeria.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not necessarily contradict any known facts, but it lacks sufficient evidence to support the stated percentage.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of accuracy and reliability due to the lack of concrete data or sources supporting the stated youth unemployment rate."}
