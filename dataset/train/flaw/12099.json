{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the budget on property tax credits for seniors and middle-class New Jerseyans, as the average benefit is still less than half of what it was in fiscal 2010.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that there were no tax increases for any New Jersey family for two consecutive years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that doubling property tax credits offsets any potential tax increases, without considering the overall tax burden on New Jersey families.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the reduction in tax credit programs in the previous year, which could impact the overall tax burden on New Jersey families."}
