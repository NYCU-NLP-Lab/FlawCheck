{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the decrease in the number of abortions in the U.S. by stating that it is at an \"all-time legal low.\" The data provided shows that while the number has decreased, it is still higher than when tracking began in 1973.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support or evidence to fully substantiate the statement that abortions in the U.S. are at an all-time low. The data provided only covers a limited time period and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the entire history of abortions in the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the number of abortions is solely due to expanded access to abortion services. However, there may be other factors contributing to the decline, such as changes in societal attitudes, contraceptive use, or other policy measures.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the number of abortions. It solely attributes the decline to expanded access to abortion services, without exploring other potential factors that could have influenced the trend.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent argument. While it states that abortions are at an all-time low, it also acknowledges that there have been small increases in certain years. This inconsistency weakens the overall argument being made.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance of the decrease in the number of abortions by stating it is at an \"all-time legal low.\" The data provided shows that the number has decreased, but it is still higher than when tracking began in 1973, suggesting that there have been higher numbers of abortions in the past.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that abortion was not universally legal in the U.S. until the Supreme Court decision in 1973. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine the number of illegal abortions performed before that decision, making it difficult to make claims about historical trends."}
