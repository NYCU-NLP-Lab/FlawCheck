{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of raising the minimum wage by stating that \"more than half work full-time\" and \"the average worker is 35 years old.\" The expert's verdict suggests that the claim includes assumptions and calculations that may not accurately represent the low-income workforce.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, it also highlights that reasonable people can differ about the assumptions made in the study, indicating that there may not be enough support to fully validate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the EPI study includes calculations that go beyond just those earning the minimum wage and includes anyone earning less than $10.10 an hour. This decision is based on the assumption that even those slightly above $10.10 would also receive a small boost. This assumption can be considered problematic and may impact the accuracy of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that looking solely at those currently earning the minimum wage may provide a different image of the low-income workforce compared to the EPI study. This indicates that there may be alternative explanations or perspectives that could challenge the claim's accuracy.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not explicitly state any contradictions with established facts. However, it does highlight the different perspectives and assumptions involved in the claim, suggesting that there may be contradictions or inconsistencies in the data and calculations used."}
