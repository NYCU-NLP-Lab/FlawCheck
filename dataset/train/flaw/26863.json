{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the incident by describing it as the policeman \"mercilessly beating up\" the young boy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its validity. It is based on a single video and tweet from Mojo Story without further verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mojo Story ran a false report without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the video may be genuine and that the boy was indeed attacked by the policeman. It only focuses on alternative explanations provided by BJP Delhi leader Kapil Mishra and journalist Raj Shekhar Jha."}
