{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the alleged incident by stating that \"80 ballots cast for Donald Trump were burned.\" However, it is later clarified that the burned items were actually sample ballots, not official ones.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that 80 Trump ballots were burned. The only evidence provided is a video clip, which is no longer viewable, and the statement from the City of Virginia Beach clarifying that the burned items were sample ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the burned items were official ballots cast for Donald Trump, without providing any substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the burned items were not official ballots but rather sample ballots, as confirmed by the City of Virginia Beach.", "Alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that the video was deliberately shared to create a false narrative or mislead viewers, as part of the ongoing allegations of election fraud.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the video as evidence without verifying its authenticity or providing additional context."}
