{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Coca-Cola's \"Share A Coke\" campaign includes a bottle for the KKK, when in reality, the KKK bottle was not a real product sold by Coca-Cola.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides one instance of a photoshopped image of a KKK bottle, which was created for an online petition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Coca-Cola would be effectively endorsing the Ku Klux Klan by sponsoring the Republican National Convention.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Coca-Cola, stating that they believe they have a role to play in the political process and sponsoring conventions is part of that role."}
