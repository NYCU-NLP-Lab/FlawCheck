{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Arnab Goswami's statement by characterizing it as calling all Keralites \"shameless\" rather than a specific group.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it only provides a 30-second clip of Goswami's show, which may not provide the full context of his statements.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Goswami's statement was intended to refer to all Keralites, which may be a problematic assumption without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Goswami's statement, such as referring to a specific group or individuals within Kerala who spread the alleged fake news.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Goswami's show was discussing the alleged fake news about relief aid, rather than directly addressing the character of all Keralites.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the context and content of Goswami's show.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact and consequences of Goswami's alleged statements by only focusing on social media backlash rather than broader implications."}
