{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Joe Biden exaggerates the number of people in the pandemic office in China. He stated that there were 44 people on the ground, but the actual number was significantly lower.", "Contradict fact": "Biden's claim contradicts the fact that not all the members of the CDC team in China were recalled. The claim that \"all those 44 people came home, never got replaced\" is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Reuters report that stated a reduction in CDC staff in China, but it does not provide evidence for the claim that the team was not replaced.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in CDC staff in China was solely due to the Trump administration's actions, without considering other possible factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the reduction in CDC staff in China, as stated in the Reuters report, which mentioned that the majority of the CDC staffers let go were Chinese nationals on the U.S. payroll.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information, such as stating that \"all the way back in the beginning of February\" Biden argued for keeping people in China, when the Reuters report he referred to was published in March.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual impact of the reduction in CDC staff in China by focusing only on the number of people and not considering the potential consequences of this decision."}
