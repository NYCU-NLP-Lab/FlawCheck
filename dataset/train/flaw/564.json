{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the difference in experiences between Obama and Clinton, as it implies that Obama was directly witnessing jobs shifting overseas while Clinton was comfortably sitting on the board at Wal-Mart.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the potential impact or involvement of Clinton's work on the Wal-Mart board. It only mentions her push for more women in management and a better environmental program, potentially leaving out other aspects of her role.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that jobs were shifting overseas during the specific time period mentioned. It also does not provide specific evidence of Clinton's actions or lack thereof on the Wal-Mart board.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a corporate lawyer and sitting on the board at Wal-Mart automatically means being disconnected from the working people and their struggles. It may overlook the potential impact or involvement Clinton had in her positions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Clinton's tenure on the Wal-Mart board, such as her focus on promoting women in management and environmental initiatives, which may suggest a different perspective on her role and actions."}
