{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which the budget is out of balance. The expert's verdict mentions that the budget as passed on July 6 had a $360 million operating surplus, which contradicts the claim that it is more than $1 billion out of balance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the budget is out of balance even with the permanent income tax increase. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the budget as passed on July 6 met the textbook definition of \"balanced\" and had a surplus.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the state of the budget. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim's downward revision from $2 billion to $1 billion is due to technical reasons and does not indicate that the budget is in better shape as originally asserted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the budget as passed on July 6 had a surplus, which contradicts the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the budget being out of balance. The expert's verdict mentions that the budget standoff and tension over school funding may have contributed to the perception of a deficient budget.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the budget as passed on July 6 had a surplus. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the budget met the textbook definition of \"balanced\" and had a $360 million operating surplus."}
