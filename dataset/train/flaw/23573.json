{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which franchised postal center outlets charge more for mailing items than official postal service rates. The expert's verdict mentions that customers who buy postage stamps at private postal outlets will typically pay a mark-up over the face value, and those who use such outlets to ship items via USPS, UPS, or FedEx generally pay a premium over what they would be charged if they dealt with those entities directly. However, it does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim that they \"may charge more\" in general.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the statement that franchised postal center outlets may charge more for mailing items than official postal service rates. The expert's verdict does mention that customers typically pay a mark-up over the face value for postage stamps and a premium for shipping services, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison of the rates.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts, and the expert's verdict supports the idea that private mailbox outlets can charge more than prevailing postal rates.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times or being inconsistent in its assertion. The expert's verdict provides consistent information about the services and pricing of private postal centers."}
