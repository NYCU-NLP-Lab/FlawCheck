{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Leonard Lance is \"rated among the most bipartisan in Congress\" is supported by rankings from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy, but it is not clear if these rankings are comprehensive or widely accepted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being rated as bipartisan is a positive attribute without questioning the criteria or implications of such a rating.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Lance's bipartisan rating, such as potential strategic motivations or the specific issues on which he has shown bipartisanship.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of bipartisanship exhibited by Leonard Lance by only stating that he ranked 13th most bipartisan in the House of Representatives for 2017 and 75th for the entirety of the previous Congress.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using labels like \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" to provide shorthand understanding of political positions, which may oversimplify the complexities of bipartisanship.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Leonard Lance's bipartisan rating by implying that he is one of the most bipartisan members of Congress without providing a clear benchmark for comparison.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts fact."}
