{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Marcel Marceau's role in saving many Jewish children from death at the hands of the Nazis. The expert's verdict mentions that Marcel Marceau saved hundreds of Jewish orphans, but the claim uses the term \"many\" without specifying a number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Marcel Marceau worked with the French underground and saved Jewish children. The expert's verdict provides some information and testimonies, but it may not be considered sufficient evidence to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marcel Marceau's work as a mime artist directly contributed to saving Jewish children during the Holocaust. While the expert's verdict mentions Marcel Marceau miming to keep children quiet as they were escaping, it is not explicitly stated that his miming directly played a role in their survival.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Marcel Marceau's actions during World War II. While the claim presents him as a hero who worked with the French underground to save Jewish children, there could be other factors or motivations behind his actions that are not fully explored or mentioned in the provided information."}
