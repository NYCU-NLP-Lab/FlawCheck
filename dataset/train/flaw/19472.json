{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that the State of Wisconsin requires washing hands at least 28 times to make one peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the state requires such a high number of hand washes for making a sandwich, without providing enough evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the state mandates 28 hand washes for making a sandwich.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the county's conclusion about the required number of hand washes, such as the interpretation of federal food regulations, which may not necessarily reflect the state's requirement."}
