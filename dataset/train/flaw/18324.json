{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that in the 2016 election, there were \"faithless electors\" who altered the final tally of electoral college votes, resulting in a different official count than the projected count.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the possibility of the 2020 election results being certified differently than the current projections.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively state that President-elect Joe Biden won exactly 306 Electoral College votes. It only mentions the projections made by news outlets.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 306 Electoral College votes won by President-elect Joe Biden in 2020 are the same as the 306 Electoral College votes won by President Donald Trump in 2016, without considering the \"faithless electors\" and the official tally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the final vote count, such as the possibility of different outcomes if the \"faithless electors\" had not altered the results in 2016."}
