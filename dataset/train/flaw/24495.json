{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the lawyer appointed by Eric Holder donated to Obama's campaign and vetted vice presidential prospects lacks specific evidence or sources to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lawyer's past donations and involvement with the Obama campaign would compromise the independence of the investigation without providing concrete evidence or reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lawyer's appointment or involvement in the investigation, such as his qualifications or experience.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the lawyer, Ronald Machen, is a former assistant U.S. attorney and was confirmed for his post by the Senate, suggesting that he has the necessary qualifications and experience for the role.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of the lawyer's past donations and involvement with the Obama campaign on the independence of the investigation, without providing substantial evidence to support this claim."}
