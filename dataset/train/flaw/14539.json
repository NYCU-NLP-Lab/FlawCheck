The expert's verdict points out that this assumption is incorrect and that the video illustrating the claim demonstrates a lack of familiarity with Facebook's security protocols.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that copying and pasting status updates on Facebook does not make users more vulnerable to hacking.

It presents a clear assertion that copying and pasting status messages on Facebook leave users vulnerable to hacking.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the vulnerability to hacking.
