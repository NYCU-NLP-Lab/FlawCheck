{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the racial disparity in incarceration rates by stating that a black person is \"four times as likely\" to be incarcerated for the exact same crime. The available evidence only supports a disparity in arrest rates for marijuana possession, not incarceration rates for all crimes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as the expert could not find any specific finding that addresses the statement made by Buttigieg.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the racial disparity in arrest rates for marijuana possession can be generalized to all crimes and incarceration rates. However, the available evidence only pertains to marijuana possession and may not be representative of all crimes or incarceration rates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the racial disparities in incarceration rates, such as differences in socioeconomic factors, criminal history, or other contextual factors that may contribute to the disparities.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by using outdated data from a decade ago, which may not accurately reflect current arrest patterns and the impact of recent decriminalization efforts for marijuana possession.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by focusing solely on the racial disparity in arrest rates for marijuana possession, without considering other factors that contribute to disparities in the criminal justice system."}
