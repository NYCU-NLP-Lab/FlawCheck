{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Pantene shampoo and conditioner cause a build-up on hair that leads to heating up and \"smoking\" when combined with highlight foils. The expert's investigation found no reports or evidence of such reactions occurring with Pantene products.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of Pantene products is the sole cause of the reported reaction, without considering other factors or possible interactions with salon products.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks or dangers associated with the reported reaction. While the expert found no evidence of such incidents, it is still possible for individual reactions or allergies to occur.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pantene products have been thoroughly tested for reactions and no evidence suggests a likelihood of such an outcome. The expert's investigation and Pantene's response both challenge the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert and Pantene suggest that something else used in the salon could have contributed to the reported reaction, indicating the presence of alternative explanations beyond the use of Pantene products."}
