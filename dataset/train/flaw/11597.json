{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in carcinogenic hydrocarbons between marijuana and tobacco by stating that marijuana contains \"50 to 70 percent more\" carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement about the difference in carcinogenic hydrocarbons between marijuana and tobacco.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of higher levels of carcinogenic hydrocarbons in marijuana smoke automatically makes it \"that much worse\" than tobacco.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the overall toxicity and health risks of marijuana and tobacco smoke, which are not addressed in the claim."}
