{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates John Holdren's position by stating that he \"proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Holdren and the other authors of the book discussed various \"coercive\" means of population control, including the idea of putting sterilants in the drinking water, but they did not advocate for such measures.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or quotes from John Holdren or the book to back up the assertion that he proposed these measures. The expert's verdict also mentions that conservative bloggers have quoted the book extensively, often out of context, to support their claims about Holdren.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by implying that John Holdren's views from over three decades ago still reflect his current beliefs and actions. The expert's verdict highlights that the book was written when Holdren was a young man and that he has not advocated for the extreme measures mentioned in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why John Holdren and the other authors discussed coercive means of population control in the book. The expert's verdict explains that the book presents a point of view on the population crisis and the authors do not shy away from controversy, but they stop short of advocating for the extreme measures mentioned in the claim."}
