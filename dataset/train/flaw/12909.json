{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the Secret Service has a policy of screening all packages addressed to individuals under their protection, which means that not all mail is directly delivered to them.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by suggesting that the news media claims of bombs sent by mail to the Clintons and Obamas were false solely based on the USPS not delivering mail to persons under Secret Service protection.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the news media claims were false. The provided evidence suggests that the packages containing suspected explosive devices were indeed sent to high-profile Democratic figures.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the absence of direct mail delivery to the Clintons and Obamas' homes proves that the news media claims were false, without considering alternative means of package delivery.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim overlooks the alternative explanation that the Secret Service may have alternative procedures in place for delivering mail to protected individuals, such as delivering it to the Secret Service field office."}
