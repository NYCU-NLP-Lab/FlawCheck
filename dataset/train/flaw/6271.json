{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the controversy surrounding Marquette University's actions, as it only briefly mentions \"widespread criticism\" without providing further details or evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Marquette University threatened to rescind the student's admission over a pro-Trump TikTok video. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on a private conversation between the student and Marquette admissions staffers, which may lack concrete proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Marquette University's actions were solely based on the student's pro-Trump TikTok video, but the expert's verdict highlights that the controversy also involved comments on topics like sexuality and immigration in other social media posts. This assumption may oversimplify the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Marquette University's actions that are not explored in the claim. The expert's verdict mentions that there were negative comments and threats directed towards the student, which could have influenced the university's response."}
