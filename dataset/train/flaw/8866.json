{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"One of George Soros' companies has provided some of the (voting) machines\" for some states lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the involvement of George Soros' companies in providing voting machines would automatically lead to biased or rigged elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by Smartmatic, the voting technology company mentioned in the claim, which denies any ties to George Soros and states that it will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the 2016 presidential elections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is abundant evidence showing that George Soros owns no voting machines in the United States.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the debunking of the claim by Snopes and the Washington Post prior to its mention by Rep. Sean Duffy on CNN.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the influence or involvement of George Soros' companies in the provision of voting machines by not presenting a clear and accurate picture of the situation."}
