{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that Cory Booker and others were unable to achieve what Michael Bloomberg is currently achieving in terms of DNC debate rules.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the changes in the DNC debate qualification requirements were specifically made to benefit Michael Bloomberg. However, the expert's verdict explains that the new rules are different from what Booker asked for and they do not guarantee Bloomberg a spot on the debate stage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the changes in the DNC debate rules, such as the elimination of the donor requirement and the inclusion of polling thresholds, which may have allowed Bloomberg, who is self-funding his campaign, to have a shot at qualifying for the debates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the new rules are different from what Booker asked for. This indicates that the claim is not accurately representing the situation.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity of the new DNC debate qualification requirements and the potential impact they may have on Bloomberg's chances of participating in the debates.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the DNC debate rules and how they apply to different candidates, including Cory Booker and Michael Bloomberg.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
