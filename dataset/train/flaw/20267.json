This contradicts the claim that presents the statistic as a fact.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any instances of the claim understating the prevalence of new HIV infections among young women in Africa.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not mention any instances of the claim exaggerating the prevalence of new HIV infections among young women in Africa.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not mention any instances of the claim faltering or being inconsistent in its presentation of the statistic."}
