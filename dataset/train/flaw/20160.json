{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of veterans who are potentially eligible to shop online at military exchanges. The expert's verdict states that about 13 million veterans are potentially qualified to make use of the online program, but this information is not included in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to verify the eligibility criteria and the process for veterans to shop online at military exchanges. The expert's verdict provides detailed information about the policy change, verification process, and the websites where veterans can shop, but this information is not included in the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all military veterans who received honorable discharges are eligible to shop online at military exchanges. However, the expert's verdict states that veterans need to verify their status using the website VetVerify.org. This suggests that not all veterans with honorable discharges may be eligible if they fail to verify their status.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the policy change or the eligibility criteria. The expert's verdict mentions that the intent behind the initiative is to compete with Amazon and that the military exchanges have locations on installations, but this information is not included in the claim."}
