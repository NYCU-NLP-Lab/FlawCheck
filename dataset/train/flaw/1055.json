{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered to have a bias of exaggeration. While it is possible to get high from secondhand marijuana smoke, the claim presents it as a definitive outcome, without acknowledging the specific circumstances required for it to happen.", "Understate": "The claim may also have a bias of understating. It fails to mention that getting high from secondhand marijuana smoke is not a common occurrence and requires specific conditions such as little to no ventilation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may have a bias of lacking enough support. While the expert provides some evidence and studies to support the claim, they mention that the research has notable limitations and the sample sizes of the studies conducted in the 1980s were small.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may have a bias of making a problematic assumption. It assumes that exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will potentially show up in a drug test without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have a bias of not considering alternative explanations. It focuses solely on the possibility of getting high from secondhand marijuana smoke without exploring other factors that could potentially affect drug test results.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to have a bias of contradicting fact as it aligns with the expert's verdict that it is possible to get high from secondhand marijuana smoke under specific conditions."}
