{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of spending not used for pandemic relief, as the expert's verdict states that about 85% of the funding is related to pandemic relief.", "Understate": "The claim understates the percentage of spending used for pandemic relief, as the expert's verdict states that about 9% of the funding is allocated for direct COVID-19 intervention.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any spending not directly related to the pandemic is not considered pandemic relief, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that 91% of the spending is not used for pandemic relief, as the expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of funds, such as long-standing policy priorities that may indirectly contribute to pandemic relief."}
