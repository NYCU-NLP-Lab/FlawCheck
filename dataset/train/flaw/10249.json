{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by referring to HR 206 as \"the largest tax increase in Georgia history\" when it actually allowed Georgia residents to vote on whether to adopt a tax.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Doug Collins repeatedly joined Stacey Abrams to raise taxes, as it only mentions one bill (HR 206) without providing further evidence of multiple instances.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that supporting HR 206, which allowed voters to decide on a tax increase, is equivalent to personally raising taxes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that both Collins and Abrams supported HR 206 and HB 277 because they believed it would benefit the state's infrastructure and economy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that HR 206 and HB 277 did not actually constitute a tax increase per se, as they deferred the decision to Georgia voters.", "Understate": "The claim understates Kelly Loeffler's support for a regional tax increase that was included in the final version of the bills put on the ballot."}
