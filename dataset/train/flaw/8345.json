{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Mitt Romney's position on the Arizona immigration law by stating that he believes it should be the model for national immigration laws, without providing direct evidence of him making such a statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mitt Romney's comment about the Arizona law being a model implies that he supports an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide direct quotes or specific instances where Mitt Romney explicitly stated that the Arizona law should be the model for national immigration laws, making it difficult to fully support the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's comment, such as him referring to a different Arizona statute or focusing on the E-Verify system rather than the overall law."}
