{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that water rates in Manila were raised up to 845 percent when the World Bank became a partial owner. This could be seen as an exaggeration because it does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that water rates were raised by 845 percent.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in water rates is directly attributable to the World Bank becoming a partial owner, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in water rates, such as changes in government policies, inflation, or infrastructure improvements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that one of the private water companies in Manila has been a financial success, suggesting that the increase in water rates may have been necessary for the company's financial viability.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent and reliable data to support the assertion of an 845 percent increase in water rates.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by simplifying it to the World Bank's involvement as the sole cause of the increase in water rates."}
