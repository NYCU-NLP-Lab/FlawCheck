{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Sean Spicer said President Trump had the authority to add words like \"covfefe\" to the language, which may not be an accurate representation of Spicer's statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide any direct quotes or evidence of Spicer explicitly stating that Trump had the authority to alter spellings of words.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Spicer's response about \"covfefe\" implies that Trump had the authority to alter spellings, which may be a problematic assumption without further evidence or clarification from Spicer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Spicer's response was intended to downplay the significance of the tweet rather than asserting Trump's authority to alter spellings."}
