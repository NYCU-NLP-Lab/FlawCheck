{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the increase in reported violent crime in South Bend is not due to an actual doubling of violent incidents but rather a change in the way police count assaults.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence to support the assertion that violent crime doubled during Mayor Pete's tenure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the increase in reported violent crime is solely attributable to Mayor Pete's leadership, without considering other factors such as changes in reporting practices.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the increase in reported violent crime, which is the change in how South Bend police counted aggravated assaults."}
