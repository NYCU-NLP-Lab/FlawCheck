{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the three world leaders were indeed friends as teenagers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo shows Angela Merkel, Theresa May, and Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 as teenagers, without providing substantial proof.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The available evidence suggests that the photo does not depict May and Grybauskait\u0117 alongside Merkel, as there are no corroborating photos or identification of them in the image.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the unlikelihood of the three world leaders being friends as teenagers, given their different educational backgrounds and locations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the other individuals in the photo published by Time in 2015 were identified as \"friends at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in Berlin in 1972,\" rather than May and Grybauskait\u0117.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing concrete evidence or responses from Merkel, May, and Grybauskait\u0117 to support the assertion made in the post.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the provided claim."}
