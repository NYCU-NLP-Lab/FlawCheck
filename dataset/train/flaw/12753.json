{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of veterans in West Virginia by stating that it has \"one of the greatest percentages of veterans in any state.\" The data from 2018 shows that West Virginia ranks seventh among the 50 states, not the highest.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement. It only mentions the governor's statement without citing any official data or research.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having the seventh-highest percentage of veterans qualifies as having \"one of the greatest percentages.\" This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation bias in the claim as it does not provide any alternative explanations or consider other factors that could affect the percentage of veterans in West Virginia."}
