{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated because it states that Chris Jacobs is a \"Never Trumper\" without providing sufficient evidence to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to a Collins staff member for evidence supporting the claim but did not receive a response. This lack of supporting evidence suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jacobs' lack of public support for Trump during the 2016 campaign means he is a \"Never Trumper.\" However, this may be a problematic assumption as individuals can support a candidate without publicly endorsing them.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Jacobs donated to several Republicans during the 2016 primary campaign but not to Trump. This alternative explanation suggests that Jacobs may have had different reasons for not supporting Trump at that time."}
