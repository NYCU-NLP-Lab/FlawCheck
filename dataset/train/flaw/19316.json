{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden supports a complete ban on school choice programs, which is not entirely accurate. Biden opposes one specific type of school choice program that uses public tax dollars for private school tuition.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Biden's stance on school choice would impact 74,000 Wisconsin students. The article cited in the claim is described as an \"analysis\" and may not provide comprehensive data or reliable sources to back up the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Biden does not oppose all forms of school choice. He supports parents choosing to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters, or traditional public schools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the impact on Wisconsin students. It does not explore other factors that may influence the number of students affected, such as changes in demographics, school enrollment, or funding allocation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the term \"school choice\" and its various interpretations. It focuses solely on voucher programs but fails to acknowledge other non-traditional schooling options such as charter schools, virtual schools, or open enrollment programs.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential impact of Biden's stance on school choice by suggesting it would have sweeping consequences for Wisconsin students. The expert's verdict highlights that Biden's power as president to halt voucher programs is limited, as they are state-authorized and funded, not subject to federal control.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing Biden's stance on school choice, as it oversimplifies his position and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue."}
