{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of fraud by stating that the video depicts Democrats committing fraud during the 2016 primary, while the expert's verdict indicates that no definitive evidence of fraud is shown in the video.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Democrats committed fraud during the 2016 primary, as the expert's verdict mentions that no portion of the video definitively shows anyone engaged in fraud or visibly affiliated with any party.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the individuals depicted in the video are Democrats committing fraud, but the expert's verdict highlights that there is no clear evidence of party affiliation or fraudulent behavior in the video.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the video may have been misrepresented or mislabeled, as similar clips were published as evidence of election fraud in Russia. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion of fraud committed by Democrats."}
