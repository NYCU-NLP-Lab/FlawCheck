{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effects of mRNA vaccines by stating that they instruct cells to make the invader's protein \"nonstop, forever and ever.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that mRNA instructions are given at the time of vaccination and are broken down by the body within days.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient scientific evidence or support to back up the assertion that vaccines send the immune system into perpetual overdrive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mRNA vaccines trick the immune system into making virus proteins nonstop, without providing evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for how mRNA vaccines work, such as the short-lived nature of messenger RNA and the degradation of instructions after protein production.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual mechanism of mRNA vaccines by not accurately describing the limited duration and degradation of the mRNA instructions."}
