{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people employed today compared to 1994. Without further evidence or data, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that seven million more people are employed today compared to 1994. Additional information or sources would be needed to validate this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in employment is solely attributed to the ruling party's achievements over the past 25 years. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to employment rates and overlook other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in employment, such as natural population growth, changes in economic policies, or global economic trends. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
