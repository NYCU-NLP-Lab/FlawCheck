{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Gov. Rick Perry \"has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years.\" The unemployment rate has been higher in the past, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the unemployment rate during Perry's tenure has not been the highest in 22 years, as there have been higher rates in the past.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the governor is solely responsible for the unemployment rate, without considering other factors that may contribute to it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the unemployment rate, such as national economic trends or other external factors, which are not explored in the claim."}
