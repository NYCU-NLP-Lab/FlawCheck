{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Sen. Obama wants to \"enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that Obama's plan is not a tax increase, but rather a proposal to let certain tax cuts expire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama's tax plan would result in the largest single tax increase since World War II. However, the expert's verdict explains that this claim is dubious and that taxes would actually go down for some income groups under Obama's plan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Obama's tax plan would be the largest tax increase. The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this claim and argues that it is unfair to label Obama's plan as a tax increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the potential tax increase, stating that it would be due to existing tax policy signed into law by someone other than Obama. This challenges the claim's assertion that Obama is solely responsible for the tax increase."}
