{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Trump supporters in the march by stating that there were 1 million attendees, while the actual number was much lower.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo in question is not from a pro-Trump rally, but rather from a gun control march in 2018.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that there were indeed 1 million Trump supporters in the march.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo accurately depicts the Dec. 12 march of 1 million Trump supporters, which is a problematic assumption since it has been proven to be false.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the photo is from a different event and not related to the Dec. 12 march."}
