{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Judge Kavanaugh could be a deciding vote on a case that has the potential to increase the power of the presidential pardon, as the Supreme Court had already decided the case in question and ruled against the notion that Federal and State prosecution for the same crime violates the double jeopardy clause.", "Understate": "The claim understates the outcome of the Supreme Court's ruling, as it fails to mention that the court ruled 7-2 against the arguments that could have resulted in a stronger presidential pardon.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or specific examples to support the assertion that Judge Kavanaugh could be a deciding vote on the case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court would lead to a potential increase in the power of the presidential pardon, without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential implications of the case, such as the possibility that Judge Kavanaugh's vote may not have a significant impact on the outcome or that other justices may have a greater influence."}
