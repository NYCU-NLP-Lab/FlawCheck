{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Hillary Clinton's immigration plan by stating that it \"would functionally end enforcement of visa overstay rules\" without sufficient evidence or support.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the issue by failing to acknowledge that Clinton's plan does not specifically address visa overstays, but does include comprehensive immigration legislation that could provide a path to citizenship for some individuals.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Clinton's plan would \"functionally end enforcement of visa overstay rules\" as there is no specific mention of visa overstays in her plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's plan would result in an open southern border that would bring \"nothing but crime and destruction\" without providing any evidence or alternative explanations for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of mention of visa overstays in Clinton's plan, such as the focus on addressing the family visa backlog and providing a path to citizenship for some individuals who overstayed their visas."}
