{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that \"probably over a million people voted twice in (the 2012) election,\" which is an exaggerated statement based on the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that over a million people voted twice in the 2012 election. The evidence only mentions 765 voters who matched on all categories and an additional 35,570 voters who matched on some categories but not Social Security number.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of voters who matched on some categories but not Social Security number indicates voter fraud. However, further investigation is needed to determine the reasons behind these matches.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the matches found, such as data errors or similarities in names and birthdates without actual voter fraud taking place.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the evidence provided only shows matches on certain categories, not concrete evidence of voter fraud or double voting.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on exaggerated language and not providing enough evidence to support the assertion of widespread voter fraud.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
