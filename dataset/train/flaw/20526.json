{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Janet Reno actually made the statement \"Donald Trump will never be president in my lifetime.\" There is no public record or credible source that confirms she made this statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Janet Reno's statement was a prediction or declaration about Donald Trump's presidency, while there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could be seen as an attempt at ironic humor or a misinterpretation of a statement made by Janet Reno, considering that she was suffering from late-stage Parkinson's disease and had difficulty speaking.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, despite the alleged statement by Janet Reno. This suggests that the claim is false or inaccurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by attributing a statement to Janet Reno without any verifiable proof or reliable sources.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Janet Reno's alleged statement by implying that it had a prophetic quality or special insight into the future.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect related to Janet Reno's alleged statement."}
