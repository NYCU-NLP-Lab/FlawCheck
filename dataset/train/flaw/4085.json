{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the video shows a crowd around the late Nigerian Emir of Rano's coffin. The only evidence provided is a short video clip and social media posts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video demonstrates a disregard for government directives on social distancing aimed at reducing the risk of the spread of coronavirus. However, this assumption may not be accurate as the video alone does not provide enough context to determine if social distancing guidelines were violated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Nigerian President's personal assistant stated that the video was \"fake\" and that the actual burial had fewer than 20 people in attendance. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the video, such as it being mislabeled or misrepresented.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by the Nigerian President's personal assistant, who stated that the video was \"fake\" and that the actual burial had fewer than 20 people in attendance. This raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential impact or significance of the video by not providing enough information or context about the Emir of Rano's status and the importance of the burial ceremony.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
