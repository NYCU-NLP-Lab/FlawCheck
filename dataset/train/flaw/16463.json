{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the discount offered by Aerom\u00e9xico by linking it to the percentage of \"Mexican DNA\" a traveler has.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the discount is solely based on the amount of \"Mexican DNA\" a traveler possesses, which may be a problematic assumption as it raises questions about the validity and fairness of such a criteria.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the existence and implementation of the \"DNA discounts\" offered by Aerom\u00e9xico. The fact that the advertisement was not promoted on the airline's official website or social media accounts raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim leaves open the possibility that the \"DNA discount\" concept was not intended to be an actual product offering, suggesting there might be alternative explanations for the advertisement."}
