{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decline in the percentage of 30-year-olds who are doing better than their parents. While the claim states that only half of 30-year-olds are doing better, the expert's verdict suggests that the percentage was even lower, ranging from 57% to 61% during the period when the candidate was being raised.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the percentage of 30-year-olds who were doing better than their parents during the candidate's teenage years. The expert's verdict highlights that the 90% figure mentioned by the candidate is too high for that specific period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the percentages mentioned. The expert's verdict relies on a study conducted by economists to support the claim, but the claim itself does not provide this information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in the percentage of 30-year-olds doing better than their parents is solely due to the withering of the American dream. It does not consider other factors that could contribute to this decline.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in the percentage of 30-year-olds doing better than their parents. It solely attributes it to the withering of the American dream without exploring other possible factors."}
