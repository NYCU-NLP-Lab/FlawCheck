{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that \"Rick Perry ended full-day Pre-K for 100,000 Texas children,\" which implies a complete elimination of full-day Pre-K for all 100,000 children. However, the expert's verdict suggests that it would be more accurate to say that the move ended state support for full-day pre-K.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a report by the Legislative Study Group, which notes that the adopted budget lacks funding for the state's Prekindergarten Early Start grant program. However, the expert's verdict also includes statements from TEA deputy associate commissioner Gina Day and representatives from school districts, indicating that the elimination of the grants did not result in the end of full-day pre-K in all districts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the elimination of the Early Start grants directly led to the end of full-day pre-K for 100,000 Texas children. However, the expert's verdict suggests that other factors, such as federal aid and cuts in other areas, have helped some districts maintain their full-day pre-K programs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claim, such as the use of federal aid and local funding by school districts to continue offering full-day pre-K, despite the loss of the Early Start grants."}
