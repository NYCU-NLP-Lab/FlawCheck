{"Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the GOP health care proposals on Medicaid by arguing that there are no cuts to Medicaid when there are indeed cuts in total Medicaid spending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that slowing the rate of future Medicaid spending is not equivalent to cutting Medicaid, which is a debatable assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that there are no cuts to Medicaid in the GOP health care proposals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the expert's verdict highlights that while future savings are not always considered cuts, the GOP health care bill does include cuts that go beyond dollars spent."}
