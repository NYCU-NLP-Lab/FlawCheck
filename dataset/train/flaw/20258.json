{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of \"key witnesses\" who have died in suspicious circumstances, as the expert's verdict states that none of the deaths were linked and some of them were not even related to the mass shooting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate the assertion that the deaths of the \"key witnesses\" were part of a cover-up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deaths of the \"key witnesses\" are connected and suspicious, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation provided by law enforcement that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman, and instead promotes the conspiracy theory of multiple shooters and a cover-up."}
