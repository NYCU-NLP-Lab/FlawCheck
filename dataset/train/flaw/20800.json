{"Understate": "The claim may understate the average debt of college graduates, as it only mentions the figure of just under $30,000, while the report cited in the expert's verdict states that the average debt nationally for 2012 graduates who took out loans was $29,400.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement that this generation, on average, is starting their careers with just under $30,000 in debt. It only mentions that the source was a report from the Institute for College Access & Success, but does not provide further details or direct quotes from the report.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $30,000 debt figure is representative of the entire generation, without providing evidence or data to support this assumption. It is possible that the debt varies widely among individuals and colleges, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to the student loan debt burden, such as the cost of tuition, availability of financial aid, or individual spending habits. It solely attributes the debt to the burden of student loan debt.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the average debt nationally for 2012 graduates who took out loans was $29,400, as stated in the expert's verdict. The claim states that the average debt is just under $30,000, which is a slight contradiction.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim. The debt figure mentioned is close to the average debt nationally, as reported by the Institute for College Access & Success.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing comprehensive and complete information about student loan debt, as it does not mention the variations in debt by state, college, or type of loan. However, this may not necessarily be a bias, but rather a limitation in the information provided."}
