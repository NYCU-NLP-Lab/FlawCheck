{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of Mayor Lee Leffingwell's support for a toll lane on MoPac. While he discussed the possibility of a variable toll on a new lane, he stated that the decision had not been made and that no existing lanes would be tolled.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that adding a toll lane on MoPac is a negative approach to easing congestion, without considering potential benefits such as facilitating the movement of emergency vehicles and providing an option for registered car pools.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that the new lane on MoPac is solely a toll lane. Mayor Lee Leffingwell described it as a \"high occupancy lane\" reserved for bus rapid transit, express buses, and registered car pools, with a potential variable toll depending on traffic movement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac. While challenger Brigid Shea stated that he voted for it in the three-year TIP transportation plan, no concrete evidence or official record is provided.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts Mayor Lee Leffingwell's statement that the decision to add a toll lane to MoPac has not been made. It also contradicts his description of the new lane as an \"express lane\" reserved for specific vehicles, rather than a traditional \"high occupancy vehicle\" or HOV lane.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing clear evidence or official records to support the assertion that Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac."}
