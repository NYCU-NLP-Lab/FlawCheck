{"Understate": "The claim may understate the length of time that state workers have gone without across-the-board raises. The expert's verdict states that the last across-the-board raise was over six years ago, while the claim only mentions six years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that state workers have not had across-the-board raises in six years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all state workers have not received across-the-board raises for six years, without providing evidence or considering the possibility that some state workers may have received raises during that time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of across-the-board raises, such as budget constraints or other priorities for state funds.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was a 3-percent raise approved for all state employees in 2006, which was over six years ago."}
