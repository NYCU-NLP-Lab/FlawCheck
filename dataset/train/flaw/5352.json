{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to confirm the presence of novel coronavirus exposure at a doctor's office in the Australian town of Aberglasslyn.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of three Asians who may have been exposed to the coronavirus automatically puts others at risk, without considering factors such as their travel history or actual infection status.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the information provided by the Australian Department of Health, which states that there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in regional areas of New South Wales at the time.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential risk and the need to keep small children away from public places, based on the unverified presence of three individuals who may have been exposed to the virus.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual situation by suggesting that there is a significant risk of exposure in the town, when there were only four confirmed cases in the entire state of New South Wales, all of whom had already recovered and were discharged from the hospital.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the request to wait outside the doctor's office, such as a precautionary measure taken by the healthcare provider to minimize potential exposure risks, rather than directly linked to the presence of individuals exposed to the coronavirus.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the situation by not providing comprehensive information or considering the broader context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia."}
