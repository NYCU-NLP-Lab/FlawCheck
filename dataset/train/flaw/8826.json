{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Canada has lowered its tax rates. While it is true that Canada has lowered its national corporate tax rate to 15 percent, the combined corporate tax rate, including provincial taxes, is 26.1 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world. The expert's verdict confirms that the average tax rate for the 34 countries studied is just slightly under 25 percent, which is consistent with what the claim states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the statement about the average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world being 25 percent. However, the expert's verdict provides data from the OECD that confirms this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a lower tax rate is inherently better without considering the potential impact on government revenue or public services. This assumption is not explicitly addressed in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the difference in tax rates between Canada and the industrialized world. The expert's verdict does not explore alternative explanations either."}
