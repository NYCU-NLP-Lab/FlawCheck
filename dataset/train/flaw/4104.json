{"Exaggerate": "The claim by Rep. Kevin Cramer exaggerates his record by stating that he has \"never cast a vote to shut down the government,\" when in fact he has voted for bills that indirectly resulted in a government shutdown.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that Cramer has always voted to keep the government open.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a formal \"shutdown vote\" exists, when in reality, a government shutdown can occur as a result of failure to pass appropriations bills or temporary spending authority.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to Cramer's claim, as experts point out that the votes he cast were procedural gambits to try and reopen the government, rather than direct votes to keep it open.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cramer has cast votes that indirectly resulted in a government shutdown, despite his assertion of never voting to shut down the government.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it presents a misleading picture of Cramer's record by omitting the votes he cast that contributed to a government shutdown.", "Understate": "The claim understates Cramer's involvement in votes that led to a government shutdown by presenting them as mere procedural votes rather than acknowledging their impact on government operations."}
