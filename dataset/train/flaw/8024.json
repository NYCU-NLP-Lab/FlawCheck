{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the majority of public funding for the Marlins stadium came from hotel taxes lacks sufficient evidence or data to support it. The expert mentions that they turned to Miami Herald articles, stadium agreement documents, and county officials to explain the deal, indicating that more information is needed to determine the exact sources of funding.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the burden of hotel taxes, which supposedly funded the stadium, is solely incurred by tourists visiting the city. This assumption may oversimplify the complex nature of tax distribution and fail to consider other factors that could contribute to the funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the funding of the Marlins stadium. The claim's assertion that hotel taxes were the primary source of public funding is not the only possibility, and other factors or sources of funding could exist.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the financial burden borne by resident taxpayers in the funding of the Marlins stadium. The expert's analysis does not provide a definitive answer, but it suggests that the claim's assertion of minimal financial burden on resident taxpayers may be an understatement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Marlins themselves, along with the county and the city, also contributed to the funding of the stadium. The claim solely attributes the funding to hotel taxes, while the expert's analysis indicates that multiple entities were involved in the financing.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim. However, the lack of sufficient support and the existence of alternative explanations suggest that the claim's assertion may not accurately represent the reality of the funding sources for the Marlins stadium.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the sources of public funding for the Marlins stadium. The expert's analysis highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for further investigation, indicating that the claim's assertion may not be entirely reliable."}
