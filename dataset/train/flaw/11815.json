{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Bill Nelson \"actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida\u2019s coast.\" While Nelson played a role in inspiring the law, the legislation that was signed into law did not have his name on it.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing Nelson's role in the legislation. While he co-sponsored a bill that aimed to prohibit offshore drilling, it did not become law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Nelson \"actually wrote\" the law. The evidence provided shows that Nelson's bill was not signed into law, but similar ideas were included in another bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Nelson can take credit for signing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida's coast, when in fact, the law was enacted through a different bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists in the form of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which included similar ideas to Nelson's bill and enacted a moratorium on drilling. This suggests that Nelson's bill was not the sole inspiration for the law."}
