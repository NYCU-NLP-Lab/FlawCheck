{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance and scale of the mock funeral, as it is presented as a widespread protest against PM Modi and CM Khattar, but the video could be from a specific event or a small group of protesters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to verify the authenticity of the video and the context in which it was recorded. The video could be doctored or taken out of context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the mock funeral is a direct result of the farmer protests against the Modi government's farm bills, but there is no explicit connection established between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video could have alternative explanations or interpretations, such as being a staged event for political propaganda or unrelated to the farmer protests.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the same video was shared in 2017, claiming it was from Haryana, suggesting a lack of credibility and consistency in its usage.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing clear and consistent information about the origin, purpose, and context of the video, making it difficult to determine its accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the claim."}
