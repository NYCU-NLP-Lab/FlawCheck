{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the impact of the Legislature's actions by stating that they deliberately made it even harder for people to access critical supports. The expert's verdict suggests that while the Legislature did pass laws limiting access to unemployment benefits, it may not be solely to blame for the problems in the system.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the issues with the already-outdated system and the backlog of unemployment payments during the pandemic. The expert's verdict highlights the overwhelmed system, backlog, and influx of calls, indicating a more significant problem than implied in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to fully substantiate the assertion that the Legislature deliberately made it harder for people to access critical supports. While the expert's verdict mentions some laws passed by the Legislature, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the laws passed in the last decade.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Legislature's actions were solely responsible for exacerbating the problems with the outdated system. The expert's verdict suggests that the Evers Administration was able to clear up the backlog, indicating that other factors may have contributed to the problems.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation by highlighting the issues with the outdated system, the backlog, and the influx of calls. It suggests that these factors, along with the Legislature's actions, contributed to the problems with accessing critical supports.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Evers Administration was able to clear up the backlog using the system, suggesting that the GOP changes may not be solely to blame. This contradicts the claim's implication that the Legislature's actions deliberately made it harder for people to access critical supports."}
