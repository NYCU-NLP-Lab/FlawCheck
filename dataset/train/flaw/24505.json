{"Exaggerate": "The claim of health care premiums increasing by 90 percent in New Hampshire may be an exaggeration as the study only looked at a subset of health care premiums and cherry-picked the larger increase statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a study conducted by Morgan Stanley that surveyed a small number of insurance brokers, with only one from New Hampshire.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in health care premiums is solely due to Obama's health care law, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of all types of health insurance plans and only focusing on individual and small-group plans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the increase in health care premiums in New Hampshire, such as changes in the insurance market or other external factors not accounted for in the claim."}
