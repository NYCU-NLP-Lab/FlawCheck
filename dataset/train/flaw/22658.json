{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the amount of unfunded liabilities by stating it as over $62 trillion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a 2010 report from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which may not provide the most up-to-date or comprehensive information on unfunded liabilities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities is accurate, without considering potential changes or updates to the data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the data on unfunded liabilities that could challenge the claim."}
