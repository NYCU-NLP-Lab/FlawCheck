{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that the claim of 72 people being implicated in terroristic activity is a gross exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the analysis cited by the claim only covered alleged terror cases up until December 31, 2014, and does not provide evidence for the claim made about the 72 people.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that none of the 72 people included on the list were responsible for any terrorist-related deaths in the U.S., contradicting the claim made.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 90-day travel ban is necessary based on the implication of 72 people from the seven countries in terroristic activity, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the government has provided no evidence of any alien from the countries named in the travel ban perpetrating a terrorist attack in the United States, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the travel ban."}
