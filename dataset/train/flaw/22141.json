{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the collaboration between Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul in raising property taxes, as it implies that they \"teamed up\" to do so.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the accusation that Madigan and Raoul collaborated to raise property taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2014 bill sponsored by Raoul and Madigan, which initially included a provision related to property taxes, is evidence of their intention to raise property taxes. However, it is not supported by the fact that the provision was removed before the bill's passage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the actions of Raoul and Madigan, such as their involvement in the bill being at the request of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and their subsequent removal of the property tax provision."}
