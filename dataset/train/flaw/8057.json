{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows Che Guevara contradicts the fact that it is a theatrical scene staged in Atlanta, Georgia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading Facebook post and does not provide any credible evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo is an accurate representation of Che Guevara, which is a problematic assumption given that it is a staged scene unrelated to him.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photo is from a theatrical demonstration at Emory University to raise awareness of humanitarian crises in El Salvador and Guatemala, and US military involvement in that war."}
