{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size and significance of the protest for mail-in voting in Seattle, suggesting that there were \"thousands\" of participants, when in reality it was a small gathering of state and local elected officials.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photo shows a protest for mail-in voting.
