{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they asked Trump's campaign for the source of his data but did not receive a response. This indicates a lack of sufficient evidence or support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict highlights that the FAIR report, which is the source of the $113 billion figure, is criticized by the American Immigration Council for relying on flawed and baseless assumptions. This suggests that the claim may be based on problematic assumptions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, stated that the cost of illegal immigration is not known for sure and could be under $113 billion. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations or differing perspectives on the cost of illegal immigration.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the total estimate of $113 billion is higher than figures estimated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research Center. This indicates a contradiction with other available data.", "Understate": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, but if the actual cost of illegal immigration is significantly higher than $113 billion, then the claim could be considered as understating the true cost.", "Exaggerate": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, but if the actual cost of illegal immigration is significantly lower than $113 billion, then the claim could be considered as exaggerating the cost."}
