{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Republicans are looking to cut Social Security by as much as 50% immediately, while the article does not provide strong support for this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the primary article linked to in the post does not support the headline and the related article provides weak support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed bill by Rep. Sam Johnson would result in a 50% immediate cut to Social Security, which is not explicitly stated in the article.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations as the New Century Times article quotes House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stating that the Johnson bill \"cuts benefits by more than a third\" rather than 50%.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a post from the New Century Times, which is linked to a column by Josh Marshall, but the column does not explicitly state the 50% immediate cut.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the New Century Times article is written by Sarah Wood, who is also the creator of a satirical website, but there is no evidence to suggest that the Social Security article is intended as satire."}
