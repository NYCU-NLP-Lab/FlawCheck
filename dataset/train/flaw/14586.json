{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the constitutional amendment by stating that it would immediately implement a plan to increase taxes on small businesses, farmers, and large employers. The expert's verdict clarifies that only a small percentage of taxpayers would see an increase in taxes, and it would not be an across-the-board increase for all small businesses and farmers.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no indication that the claim falters at times or that the expert's verdict contains any inconsistencies or contradictions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that the constitutional amendment would immediately increase taxes on small businesses, farmers, and large employers. The expert's verdict provides more nuanced information and data to support their analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "There is no clear problematic assumption in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation for the potential impact of the constitutional amendment. The expert's verdict, however, presents a more nuanced perspective on the potential impact, highlighting that not all small businesses and farmers would be affected in the same way."}
