{"Understate": "The claim may understate the accessibility of Gov. Scott Walker to the general public by stating that he has not done a public event since 2015 where admission is not required or being on an approved list. The expert's verdict provides evidence of public events that Walker has attended, such as the 2018 re-election campaign announcement rally, which suggests that the claim may be an understatement of his accessibility.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event without requiring admission or being on an approved list. The expert's verdict provides some evidence of events that contradict this claim, but it is not comprehensive enough to fully support or refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only valid definition of a \"public event\" is one where admission is not required and being on an approved list is not necessary. This assumption may be problematic as it does not take into account events where Walker attends but is not the host, which may still be considered public events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the limited accessibility of Gov. Scott Walker to the general public. The expert's verdict mentions that Walker attends events held by others that are open to the public, but events he stages have more limited access. This suggests that there may be reasons or considerations for his limited accessibility, such as security concerns or logistical constraints."}
