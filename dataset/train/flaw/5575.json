{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that the defense readiness alert level was quietly raised to \"DEFCON 3\" in mid-June 2016, implying a significant event or situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the defense readiness alert level was raised to \"DEFCON 3\" in mid-June 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the raising of the defense readiness alert level to \"DEFCON 3\" indicates a serious and significant event taking place, without providing sufficient evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for the raising of the defense readiness alert level, such as routine military exercises or other non-threatening reasons.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it relies on information from a felon-run conspiracy website, SuperStation95, which may not be a reliable or credible source of information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the DEFCON system is a well-established alert state used by the United States Armed Forces, and the raising of the alert level is not necessarily a secretive or quiet action.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the raising of the defense readiness alert level to \"DEFCON 3\" by comparing it to previous levels of DEFCON and implying that it is a relatively minor escalation."}
