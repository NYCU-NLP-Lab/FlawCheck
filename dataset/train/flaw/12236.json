{"Exaggerate": "The claim that \"the people that went to school with (Barack Obama), they never saw him, they don't know who he is\" exaggerates the idea that Obama had no presence or recognition among his classmates.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it is not clear whether it refers to Obama's entire educational history or specifically to his time at Columbia University.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no substantial evidence or testimonies provided to back up the assertion that Obama was unknown to his classmates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that if Obama's classmates did not see him or know him, it means he had a shady or unremarkable background.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim leaves room for alternative explanations, such as the possibility that Obama had a more private or reserved personality during his school years."}
