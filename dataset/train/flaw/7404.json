{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Wisconsin has the highest infant mortality rate for black babies nationwide, which implies that it is the highest among all states. However, the claim only provides data comparing Wisconsin to Massachusetts and does not include all states in the comparison.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides data from 2013-2015 and does not include a comprehensive analysis of all states' infant mortality rates for black babies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high infant mortality rate for black babies in Wisconsin is solely due to racial disparities. However, the claim does not consider other potential factors such as socioeconomic conditions, healthcare access, and stress during pregnancy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the high infant mortality rate in Wisconsin, such as the impact of poverty, stress during pregnancy, and the concentration of minorities in impoverished areas.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Wisconsin has a lower infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic white women compared to the national rate. This indicates that the claim's focus on racial disparities may not provide a complete picture of the overall infant mortality situation in Wisconsin.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the broader context of infant mortality rates in Wisconsin by solely focusing on the rate for black babies. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of infant mortality rates across different racial and ethnic groups in the state."}
