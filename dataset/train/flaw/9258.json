{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that conjoined twins were born in Surigao, southern Philippines in June 2020. The only evidence provided is a photo with a caption on Facebook, which is not enough to confirm the veracity of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The existence of an alternative explanation is evident in the fact that the same photo was featured in multiple reports about conjoined twins born in the Mexican city of Juarez in January 2017. This suggests that the photo may not be related to the claimed incident in Surigao.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the photo in question was actually associated with the birth of conjoined twins in Mexico in 2017, as reported by multiple sources. Therefore, the claim's assertion of the twins being born in Surigao in 2020 is contradictory to the known facts.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by using emotional language in the Facebook caption, stating that those who don't share or type \"Amen\" are heartless. This exaggeration attempts to manipulate readers' emotions and encourage them to share the post.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of credibility and reliability due to the inconsistencies and discrepancies found in the evidence provided. The fact that the same photo was associated with a different incident in Mexico raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photo posted on Facebook is evidence of conjoined twins being born in Surigao in June 2020. However, this assumption is problematic as it doesn't consider the possibility of the photo being unrelated or falsely attributed to the claimed incident.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
