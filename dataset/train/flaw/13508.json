{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of women who have attempted to self-induce abortion in Texas in the past year by stating that it is \"more than 100,000.\" The research actually provides a range of estimates between 100,000 and 240,000 women, and it is not specifically limited to the past year alone.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that \"more than 100,000 women in Texas have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone.\" The evidence provided only gives an estimate of the proportion of women who have tried to self-abort, but not a specific number for the past year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the research study's estimate of women who have tried to self-abort in Texas can be directly applied to the past year alone, which is a problematic assumption. The research does not specifically focus on the past year, but rather provides an estimate of women who have tried to self-abort \"ever\" in their lives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the decline in the number of women's health centers in Texas and the increase in self-induced abortions. The claim does not explore other factors that might contribute to this situation, such as changes in healthcare policies, access to contraception, or socioeconomic factors."}
