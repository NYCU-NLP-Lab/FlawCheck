{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Bernie Sanders' parents were Holocaust survivors lacks direct evidence or specific information to support it. The sources provided mention Sanders' father being from Poland and his family being wiped out in the Holocaust, but they do not explicitly state that his parents were survivors themselves.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Sanders' father came from Poland and his family was wiped out in the Holocaust, it automatically means that his parents were Holocaust survivors. However, this is not explicitly stated in the sources provided, and it is a problematic assumption to make without further evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because the sources provided do not consistently support the assertion that Sanders' parents were Holocaust survivors. While some sources mention his father's connection to the Holocaust, they do not explicitly state that his parents were survivors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that Sanders' parents were Holocaust survivors. The sources provided mention that Sanders' father saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust, which could imply that other family members were survivors, but it does not necessarily mean that his parents themselves were survivors."}
