{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. by fall 2020.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the total number of COVID-19 deaths will be double the American death toll from the Vietnam War by fall 2020.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may affect the comparison between COVID-19 deaths and Vietnam War deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the COVID-19 death toll in the United States has already surpassed a doubling of U.S. Vietnam war deaths even before fall 2020.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the timeframe by stating that the doubling of COVID-19 deaths will occur by fall 2020, when it has already happened.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging that the CDC's provisional count of COVID-19 deaths may differ from other sources' counts, such as John Hopkins University.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the total number of COVID-19 deaths by fall 2020 will be double the American death toll from the Vietnam War without providing a clear rationale or basis for this assumption."}
