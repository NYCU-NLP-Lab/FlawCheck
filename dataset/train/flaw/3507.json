This may be an exaggeration as experts' estimates for immunity duration have not changed due to the President's illness.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in views on immunity duration is solely due to partisan reasons, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that people's views on immunity duration changed solely because the speaker contracted COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the change in views on immunity duration, such as evolving scientific understanding and ongoing research on the topic."}
