{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the level of debate among economists regarding the total price tag of COVID-19 relief spending.", "Falters at times": "The claim fails to acknowledge the concerns raised by economists such as Lawrence Summers, Olivier Blanchard, and Desmond Lachman, who argue that spending too much on COVID-19 relief could have negative consequences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that there is a consensus among economists that we can't spend too much on COVID-19 relief.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all economists, regardless of their political views, agree on the need for substantial spending on COVID-19 relief, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or viewpoints provided by economists who argue against the $1.9 trillion price tag for COVID-19 relief."}
