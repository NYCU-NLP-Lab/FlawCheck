{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that 80 percent of the tax breaks go to the top 1 percent, which may be an overstatement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by a preliminary analysis from the Tax Policy Center, but it does not provide additional evidence or studies to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed tax-cut plan would hugely and mostly benefit America's wealthiest, without considering potential benefits for other income groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of tax breaks, such as potential economic growth or job creation effects of the tax-cut plan."}
