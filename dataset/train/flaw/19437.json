{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of budget cuts made by Tim Kaine as governor, as the general fund budget did decrease by $300 million, but the state was still spending more money on general fund programs at the end of his term than at the beginning.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a smaller general fund budget is indicative of being a spending hawk, without considering other factors such as the use of stimulus money to support general fund programs during the recession.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to show that Tim Kaine's budget cuts were solely responsible for the decrease in the general fund budget, as the recession and the use of stimulus money also played a significant role.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the decrease in the general fund budget, which is the impact of the recession and the use of federal stimulus money to support general fund programs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the state was spending more money on general fund programs at the end of Kaine's term than at the beginning, due to the use of stimulus money.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the recession and the use of stimulus money on the general fund budget, as it only focuses on the decrease in the budget without considering the overall spending on general fund programs."}
