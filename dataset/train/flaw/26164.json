{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that a man contaminated Cadbury products by adding HIV (AIDS) blood. There is no evidence or factual basis to support this claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no truth to the allegation of Cadbury products being contaminated with HIV (AIDS) blood. The company itself has debunked the claim as a hoax.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no credible evidence or source provided to substantiate the allegation. The supposed news was not carried by international media outlets like BBC, and the image used in the claim is unrelated to the alleged contamination.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of a man being arrested, which is unrelated to Cadbury or HIV contamination, is evidence of the alleged contamination. This assumption is problematic and unfounded.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation exists that the image used in the claim is actually of Aminu Sadiq Ogwuche, the alleged mastermind of a bombing in Nigeria, and has no connection to Cadbury or HIV contamination."}
