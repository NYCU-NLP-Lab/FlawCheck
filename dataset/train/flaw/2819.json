{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the Department of Justice's policy on commenting on conversations between the attorney general and the president. The expert's analysis reveals that the policy is not as absolute as initially claimed, as it allows for consultation with the White House counsel and the potential invocation of executive privilege.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Department of Justice's policy is well-defined and explicitly written down. However, the expert's investigation reveals that the policy is not clearly stated in the memos provided by the Justice Department.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the policy is longstanding. The expert's analysis shows that the memos provided do not explicitly state that an attorney general should not comment on conversations with the president.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that Attorney General Sessions' refusal to comment on his conversations with President Trump may be based on the need to consult with the president and potentially invoke executive privilege, rather than solely relying on a longstanding policy.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the memos provided by the Justice Department do not explicitly support the assertion that the attorney general should not comment on conversations with the president."}
