{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the direct impact of union membership on middle class wages, as it implies a causal relationship between the two.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim presents some evidence in the form of a chart, it may be argued that further evidence is needed to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in union membership is the main factor causing the decline in middle class wages, without considering other possible factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while there is evidence of a correlation between union membership and wages, it does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. Other factors, such as global competition, may also play a role in influencing wages."}
