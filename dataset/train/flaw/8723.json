{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that Donald Trump tweeted about ordering the Treasury secretary to send checks to Americans, but also mentioned searching social media history for posts with #NotMyPresident before providing the check. The expert's verdict states that no such tweet was made by Trump.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is bipartisan support for a proposal to send American adults a check for $1,000 as part of an economic stimulus package. The expert's verdict mentions this fact, indicating that the claim is not aligned with reality.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or source for the alleged tweet by Donald Trump. The expert's verdict also mentions that the tweet does not appear in the database of Trump's tweets.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Donald Trump would discriminate against Democrats by not providing them with a check if they have used the hashtag #NotMyPresident in their social media posts. This assumption is not supported by any evidence or official statements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanation for the alleged tweet by Donald Trump. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides the explanation that the image being shared on social media is misleading and that Trump did not make such a tweet."}
