{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Milk-Bone dog treats cause cancer in one out of every two dogs that eat them, which may be an exaggeration as there is no strong evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or scientific studies to support the assertion that Milk-Bone dog treats cause cancer in dogs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between Milk-Bone dog treats and cancer in dogs without considering other potential factors or variables that could contribute to the development of cancer.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents alternative explanations, such as the presence of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) in Milk-Bone treats, which is considered safe by the FDA and has not been conclusively linked to cancer in dogs.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the FDA has deemed BHA as safe and that several studies indicate that BHA is not a carcinogenic substance.", "Falters at times": "The claim relies on unreliable sources, such as a Facebook page and a blog, which may falter in terms of credibility and accuracy.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
