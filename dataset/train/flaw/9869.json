{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential savings and benefits of \"Medicare for All\" by stating that it will lower healthcare costs by $450 billion a year and save the lives of 68,000 people who would have otherwise died. The expert's verdict indicates that the cost estimates and assumptions made in the study are uncertain and more generous than other analyses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a single study published in the Lancet journal. The expert's verdict mentions that the Sanders campaign has referenced 22 other studies, but these were not provided for verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that moving to a single-payer healthcare system like \"Medicare for All\" will automatically result in cost savings and improved health outcomes. The expert's verdict highlights that previous analyses have suggested that the proposal could increase health spending, not decrease it.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or viewpoints regarding the potential costs and impacts of \"Medicare for All.\" The expert's verdict includes statements from other experts who question the validity and relevance of the Lancet paper in the overall debate on healthcare reform.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts alternative estimates of the cost of \"Medicare for All\" by stating that it will cost $17 trillion over 10 years. The expert's verdict mentions that most other estimates place the cost between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential challenges and difficulties in funding \"Medicare for All\" by presenting a lower cost estimate and suggesting that the proposed financing mechanisms will easily cover the costs. The expert's verdict indicates that paying for the healthcare expansion would be far more difficult based on higher cost estimates.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by relying on a single study and not providing additional evidence or supporting studies to back up the claims made. The expert's verdict mentions that the Sanders campaign did not provide the other 22 studies referenced in their defense of \"Medicare for All.\""}
