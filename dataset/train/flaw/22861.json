{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that many animals froze to death in Amarillo, Texas, during the winter storm. The Amarillo Animal Management and Welfare Department and the Potter County Sheriff's Office reported no calls of animals frozen to death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photos shared in the Facebook post accurately depict animals frozen to death in Amarillo. However, the user later clarified that the photos were not taken in Amarillo, raising doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that neither the Amarillo Animal Management and Welfare Department nor the Potter County Sheriff's Office received any reports of animals frozen to death.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of animals freezing to death in Amarillo during the winter storm, as there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the efforts made by organizations like Gracie's Project to respond to increased requests for welfare checks of animals during the winter storm.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While the claim criticizes owners of huskies who left their dogs outside during the storm, another Facebook user argues that there is nothing wrong with leaving double-coated dogs outside. This presents an alternative explanation and differing opinions on the matter."}
