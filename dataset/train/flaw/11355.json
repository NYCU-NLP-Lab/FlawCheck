{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the viewership of 'Morning Joe' by stating that \"more people have watched 'Morning Joe' than CNN and HLN 5 years in a row.\" The provided evidence suggests that viewership numbers vary and that 'Morning Joe' does not consistently outperform its competitors.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because the viewership numbers for 'Morning Joe' are not consistently higher than CNN and HLN, as indicated by the provided evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the evidence provided shows conflicting viewership data and does not clearly establish that 'Morning Joe' has consistently outperformed CNN and HLN for five years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that viewership numbers fluctuate and that different metrics (such as total viewers and viewers within the 25-54 demographic) can show different rankings for the morning shows."}
