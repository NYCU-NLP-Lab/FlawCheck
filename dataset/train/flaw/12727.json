{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the effectiveness of treatment courts for veterans by stating that 73% of veterans are graduating from drug courts, without providing evidence or context to support this statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that drug courts are working for veterans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the graduation rate of drug courts for the general population is lower than that of veterans, without providing evidence or comparing the two rates accurately.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the higher graduation rate of veterans in treatment courts, such as differences in the severity of offenses or the level of support provided to veterans in these programs.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the graduation rate of drug courts for the general population by stating that it is \"like 53, 55 percent\" without providing specific data or sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the most recent data on veterans treatment courts is from 2016, while the claim is made in 2017. This raises questions about the accuracy and relevance of the statistics provided."}
