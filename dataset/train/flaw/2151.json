{"Exaggerate": "The claim of cutting the deficit by two-thirds may be an exaggeration as it does not provide enough evidence or context to support such a significant reduction.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data to verify the extent of the deficit reduction.", "Falters at times": "The expert mentions that the deficit claim caught their attention, suggesting that there may be some doubts or uncertainties surrounding the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that cutting the deficit is a significant accomplishment without considering other factors or alternative explanations for the reduction.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that the deficit is an annual number and does not address the larger issue of the national debt, which has increased under Obama's presidency. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the deficit reduction."}
