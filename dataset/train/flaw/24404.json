{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence of an effort to establish Sharia or Islamic law as part of any effort to defund the police in Minneapolis.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of refugees settled in Minnesota under President Barack Obama, stating it as 1 million when the actual number is 6,320.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove a direct link between the resettlement of refugees and the desire for Sharia Law in Minneapolis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the resettlement of refugees in Minnesota is directly linked to the desire for Sharia Law, without providing evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores alternative explanations for the protests and calls for defunding the police, such as the death of George Floyd and the nationwide demonstrations against police brutality."}
