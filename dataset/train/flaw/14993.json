{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by the British Prime Minister Theresa May, suggesting that she said pedophiles should be allowed to adopt children. This is not true and has been twisted from a 2010 news report.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Theresa May made such a statement. The only source cited is a junk news site, Neon Nettle, known for spreading false information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that May's order to review legislation related to the vetting and barring scheme for working with children and vulnerable adults meant that she wanted to give more rights to child abusers. This assumption is not supported by any credible sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that May's spokesman explicitly stated that she would not consider allowing pedophiles to adopt children. This statement is omitted in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a misleading and twisted version of a 2010 news report, creating a false narrative around May's stance on pedophiles adopting children.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that May ordered a review of the vetting and barring scheme to address concerns about the vetting process for ordinary volunteers, rather than to give more rights to child abusers. This alternative explanation is not mentioned in the claim."}
