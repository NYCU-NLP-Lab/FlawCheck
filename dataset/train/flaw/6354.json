{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount spent by President Obama on make-work government jobs, as the actual amount was $816 billion, not \"nearly a trillion dollars.\"", "Understate": "The claim understates the amount of money that was allocated for tax benefits and entitlement payments, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the total stimulus spending.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that all the stimulus money went towards \"make-work government jobs,\" as a significant portion was used for tax benefits, grants, contracts, and loans in various areas.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all government jobs funded by the stimulus were \"make-work\" jobs, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the allocation of stimulus funds, such as funding for work carried out by the private sector, like road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors."}
