{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no clear evidence or data provided to support the statement that only one signature counts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that signing multiple recall petitions will result in only one signature being counted, but this assumption is not clearly supported or explained.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the expert, stating that the first signature will still be counted, but duplicates can be thrown out. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that only one signature counts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it is not clear about the process of how multiple signatures are handled and whether they will be counted or not.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are no legal restrictions or penalties for signing a petition more than once, as stated by the expert. The claim implies that only one signature will count, which contradicts this fact.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential consequences of signing multiple times, as the expert mentions that it can falsely inflate the true number of signatures and put the cause in jeopardy.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
