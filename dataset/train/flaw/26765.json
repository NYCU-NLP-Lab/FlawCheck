{"Exaggerate": "The claim that health insurance and medical costs are \"going down because of Obamacare\" may be an exaggeration as the data provided only shows a decline in a couple of health care price indices for a specific time period.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a limited set of data (price indices for a specific month) and does not consider other factors that may influence health care costs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the observed decline in health care price indices is solely due to Obamacare, without considering other possible explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert points out that the decline in health care price indices may not necessarily mean that overall health costs have gone down, as total monthly health care spending actually rose during the same period.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the long-term impact of Obamacare on health care costs and acknowledging that it will take years to fully understand its effects.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that determining the impact of Obamacare on health care costs is difficult due to insufficient data availability."}
