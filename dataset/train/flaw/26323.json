{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Iceland has \"virtually removed\" Down syndrome from their population through abortion. The expert's verdict clarifies that while there is a high termination rate for pregnancies with a Down syndrome diagnosis, babies with Down syndrome are still being born in Iceland.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or statistics to back up the statement. The expert's verdict provides more information about the prenatal screening tests and termination rates in Iceland and other countries.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the high termination rate for pregnancies with a Down syndrome diagnosis is equivalent to \"removing\" Down syndrome from the population. The expert's verdict clarifies that babies with Down syndrome are still being born in Iceland.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high termination rate, such as personal choice or societal factors. The expert's verdict provides information about similar termination rates in other European countries and the United States.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Icelandic government does not mandate abortions for mothers whose unborn children test positive for Down syndrome, nor do they mandate that a mother is required to take the test in the first place. The expert's verdict provides this clarification.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting an incomplete and exaggerated view of the situation in Iceland. The expert's verdict provides more accurate information and context.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the prenatal screening tests are optional and that expectant mothers must be informed about their availability in Iceland. The expert's verdict provides this clarification."}
