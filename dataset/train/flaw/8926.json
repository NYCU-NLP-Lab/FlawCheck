{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it implies a direct connection between David Vitter answering a prostitute's call and him skipping a vote honoring soldiers. The claim suggests that Vitter actively chose prostitutes over patriots based on these actions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Vitter intentionally skipped the vote to answer a prostitute's call. The expert's verdict mentions that Vitter's campaign declined to answer where he was on the day of the vote, leaving the claim without substantial evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct correlation between Vitter's actions of answering a prostitute's call and him skipping the vote. It implies that these two events are related and that Vitter's actions were a deliberate choice.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Vitter's absence from the vote and his subsequent phone call. The claim does not consider any other possibilities or reasons for his actions, leaving room for alternative explanations that may not involve a deliberate choice between prostitutes and patriots.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a clear and supported argument. It relies on the assumption and implication of a connection between Vitter's actions, but lacks sufficient evidence or a strong logical argument.", "Understate": "There is no apparent understatement bias in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any established facts."}
