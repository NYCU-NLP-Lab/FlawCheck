{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the violence by stating that \"students associated with Left parties bashed up ABVP members\" without providing specific evidence or details.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to conclusively prove that Left parties were responsible for the attack on ABVP members. The video alone does not provide enough context or identification of the individuals involved.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of a man in a red jacket beating up another person in green clothing is evidence of Left parties attacking ABVP members. However, this assumption is not based on concrete evidence or identification of the individuals involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the violence in JNU, such as conflicts between different student groups or other external factors. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
