{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks a direct link to the specific analysis referenced by NerdWallet, and the data used in the analysis are described as \"estimates\" or \"extrapolations.\" This suggests a lack of sufficient supporting evidence for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that bankruptcies over medical bills are non-existent in other first-world countries due to the implementation of national social health insurance/medical care systems. This assumption may oversimplify the complex factors contributing to bankruptcies in different countries.", "Falters at times": "The claim relies on extrapolations and estimates from NerdWallet's analysis, which may not provide a completely accurate representation of the number of Americans declaring bankruptcy over medical bills every year.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high number of Americans declaring bankruptcy over medical bills, such as differences in healthcare costs, insurance coverage, or socioeconomic factors.", "Contradict fact": "There is no direct contradiction of facts in the claim. However, the lack of a specific link to the NerdWallet analysis and the reliance on estimates and extrapolations raise questions about the accuracy of the claim."}
