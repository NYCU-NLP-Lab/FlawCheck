{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the candidate differs from their party on matters of policy. The expert's verdict suggests that the examples provided by the candidate may not truly demonstrate significant differences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the candidate's assertion of differing from their party on business legislation, consumer protection, and free trade agreements. The expert's verdict suggests that the examples provided by the candidate do not adequately demonstrate these differences.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that differing from the party on specific policy matters is evidence of being independent and bipartisan. The expert's verdict questions this assumption and suggests that the examples provided may not truly reflect significant differences."}
