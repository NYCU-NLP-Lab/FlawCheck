{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the comparison between breaking the law to enter college and breaking the law to enter the country by implying that immigrants in the country illegally receive free college education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that immigrants in the country illegally receive free college education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that breaking the law to enter the country and breaking the law to enter college are equivalent actions, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all students involved in the college admissions bribery scandal have been expelled, as some universities are handling their cases differently.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity and limited availability of financial aid and tuition assistance programs for immigrants in the country illegally."}
