{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Beverly Hall left the school district \"significantly better than she found it\" contradicts the findings of a yearlong investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in the district.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of the cheating scandal on the district and fails to acknowledge the negative consequences it had on the education system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Beverly Hall left the district significantly better. The evidence provided only focuses on the graduation rate, which may be unreliable according to an investigation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the collaboration and accomplishments mentioned by former Mayor Shirley Franklin outweigh the negative impact of the cheating scandal, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the improvements in the district, such as the possibility that the cheating scandal artificially inflated test scores and graduation rates."}
