{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of people who have died from COVID-19 at home by stating that \"Nobody is found dead of corona in their homes.\" However, the expert's verdict mentions that as of September 17, nearly 10,000 people had died at home from COVID-19.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all deaths from COVID-19 occur in hospitals and not at home. This assumption is problematic because it overlooks the fact that a significant number of COVID-19 deaths have occurred outside of healthcare facilities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that nobody dies of COVID-19 at home. The expert's verdict provides examples and data that contradict this claim, indicating that a growing number of at-home deaths have been confirmed to be caused by COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that the only reason people die from COVID-19 at hospitals and not at home is due to the nature of the disease. However, alternative explanations could include factors such as delayed medical treatment, lack of access to healthcare facilities, or individuals choosing to stay at home instead of seeking medical help.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the notion that nobody dies from COVID-19 at home by using strong language like \"Let that sink in.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that contradicts this exaggeration by highlighting the number of at-home deaths attributed to COVID-19.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a significant number of COVID-19 deaths have occurred at home. The expert's verdict provides data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other sources that confirm this fact.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a sweeping statement about COVID-19 deaths without considering the various circumstances and locations in which these deaths occur. The expert's verdict highlights the complexity of COVID-19 deaths and the need to consider different settings, including homes."}
