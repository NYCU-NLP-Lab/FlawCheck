{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a \"100 percent increase in student debt under this Democratic White House\" is an exaggeration. The actual increase is about 86 percent since Obama took office.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion of a 100 percent increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in student debt is solely attributable to the Democratic White House, without considering other factors such as economic downturns and tuition increases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Experts argue that the increase in student debt is more a result of the economic downturn and other factors, rather than being solely tied to the Democratic White House."}
