{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the level of support for a national popular vote by stating that \"Seventy-four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president].\" This is based on a single poll conducted by a Democratic-leaning survey firm and may not be representative of the entire population.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on only one poll conducted by a specific organization and may not reflect the views of all Rhode Islanders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reason for supporting a national popular vote is solely because of a belief in \"one person-one vote.\" It does not consider other potential reasons or alternative explanations for supporting such a change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the level of support for a national popular vote, such as the potential influence of political affiliation or party preferences. The poll was conducted by a Democratic-leaning survey firm, suggesting a potential bias in the results.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the proposal to switch to a national popular vote system has not yet taken effect and requires agreement from enough states representing a majority of electoral votes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough context or information about the proposal, its potential implications, and the limitations of the poll conducted. It also does not address any potential criticisms or counterarguments to a national popular vote system."}
