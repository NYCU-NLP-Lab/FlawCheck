{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the video does not provide any context or explanation for why the crowds are running from the Chinese man. The expert's verdict mentions that the earliest version of the video was published before the start of the novel coronavirus epidemic, suggesting that the running crowds may not be related to the virus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crowds running from the Chinese man are doing so because of the novel coronavirus. However, there is no evidence or context provided in the claim or the expert's verdict to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the crowds are running from the Chinese man. The expert's verdict mentions that opposition leaders in Mauritania accused authorities of fixing the result of the presidential election and criticized a crackdown on protests. This suggests that there may be other reasons for the crowds running, unrelated to the novel coronavirus.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was published before the start of the novel coronavirus epidemic. This contradicts the assumption that the running crowds are related to the virus.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the significance or impact of the video by simply stating that it shows crowds running from a Chinese man. Without further context or explanation, the claim does not fully convey the potential implications or consequences of the video.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
