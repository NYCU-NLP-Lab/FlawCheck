{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Hillary Clinton plans to massively increase admissions of Middle East refugees, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees, may be seen as an exaggeration. While Clinton did express support for increasing the number of refugees, she also emphasized the need for rigorous vetting and screening.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that there is already a screening plan in place for refugees entering the United States. The expert's verdict confirms that there is a screening plan, contradicting Trump's assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Clinton plans to increase admissions of Middle East refugees by 500 percent. The expert's verdict provides some context to Clinton's statements, but there is no concrete evidence of a specific plan for such a significant increase.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that refugees are potential terrorists, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict mentions that Trump argues refugees are potential terrorists, but it does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's stance on admitting refugees. The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton emphasized the need to prioritize persecuted religious minorities and those who have been brutalized, suggesting a different motivation for her position.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is already a screening plan in place for refugees entering the United States, as confirmed by the expert's verdict."}
