{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"inner-city crime reaching record levels\" is exaggerated, as the data shows a decline in crime rates since the 1990s.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as there is no official category or definition for \"inner-city\" crime, making it difficult to accurately measure and compare crime levels.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a direct correlation between crime levels and African-American voters supporting Trump, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the recent uptick in crime in certain cities, which may not necessarily be indicative of a nationwide trend of increasing crime levels."}
