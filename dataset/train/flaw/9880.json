{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the gender pay gap in Georgia by stating that women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. This is because the expert's verdict mentions that the gender pay gap diminishes substantially when men and women of the same age, experience, and education do the same job.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender pay gap is solely due to discrimination, without considering other factors such as differences in career choices, work hours, and responsibilities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that women in Georgia earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. The expert's verdict mentions that Barksdale's numbers are different, indicating a lack of specific evidence for this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions alternative explanations for the gender pay gap, such as differences in career choices, work hours, and industry preferences. This suggests that the claim may not consider these alternative explanations and solely attributes the pay gap to discrimination.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the gender pay gap in Georgia. The expert's verdict mentions that Barksdale's numbers are different, indicating a potential inconsistency or lack of accuracy in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the gender pay gap by not considering other factors that contribute to the disparity, such as unpaid child-rearing responsibilities and differences in career choices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the gender pay gap diminishes substantially when men and women of the same age, experience, and education do the same job. This indicates a contradiction between the claim and the expert's verdict."}
