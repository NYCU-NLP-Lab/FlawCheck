{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the influence of Wall Street firms as Mitt Romney's top donors and technology companies and universities as Barack Obama's top donors.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the diversity of donors for both candidates, as it only focuses on the top five donors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify the accuracy of the information, as it is based on an undated Facebook post and the information may have changed since then.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the top donors reflect the candidates' ties to specific sectors, such as Wall Street for Romney and technology and academia for Obama, without providing evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the donors listed, such as personal connections or individual interests, that are not explored in the claim."}
