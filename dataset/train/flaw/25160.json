{"Understate": "The claim may understate the difference in potency between modern marijuana and the weed smoked by baby boomers. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the THC content of marijuana has significantly increased since the 1970s, suggesting that the claim may not fully acknowledge the extent of the difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that \"pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence of increased THC content, but the claim does not directly reference this evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption by implying that the perception that marijuana is not dangerous is false. The expert's verdict does not directly address the danger or safety of marijuana, but rather focuses on the increase in THC content. The claim assumes that the perception of marijuana as not dangerous is false without providing further evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation as to why \"pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking.\" The expert's verdict suggests that the increase in THC content can be attributed to several factors, including better knowledge of how to grow the cannabis plant. This alternative explanation is not acknowledged in the claim."}
