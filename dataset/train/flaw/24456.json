{"Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of training required for police officers by comparing it to the training required for cosmetologists. The expert points out that police officers undergo several months of training in a police academy, followed by probationary periods, which suggests that the claim may not fully acknowledge the extent of training for police officers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to definitively prove that cosmetologists require many more hours of training than police officers. The expert provides some information about the training process for both professions, but it is not comprehensive enough to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of training hours directly correlates with the level of expertise and competence in a profession. However, the expert argues that the types of training for cosmetologists and police officers are different, making it a problematic assumption to compare them solely based on the number of hours.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the purpose of comparing training hours between cosmetologists and police officers is often to criticize the latter's training. However, the expert argues that such comparisons fail to consider the different types of training involved, implying that there could be alternative explanations for the discrepancy in training hours."}
