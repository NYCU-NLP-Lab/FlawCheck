{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Joe Biden did not legally win the presidential election by suggesting that there is still doubt about the legitimacy of his victory, despite the Electoral College certification and Inauguration Day nearing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Joe Biden won the election by over 7 million votes and received 306 electoral votes, meeting the requirements to be elected president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on false claims of election fraud spread by President Donald Trump and his allies, despite no evidence to support these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is doubt about the legality of Joe Biden's victory without providing any substantial evidence or valid reasoning.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that Joe Biden won the election through a legitimate process, building on previous gains in certain states and expanding his voting base in others.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by referencing misleading information, such as the suggestion of a \"suitcase\" video in Georgia missing context, which undermines its credibility."}
