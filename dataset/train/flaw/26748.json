{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the silence of the media on the alleged rape inside the madrassa, suggesting that if it had been a temple or Hindu saint involved, the media would have covered it extensively for months.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its assumption that the media is silent on the issue, as it provides evidence of the video circulating on social media and being shared widely.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the media is intentionally silent on the issue due to the involvement of a madrassa and maulvi.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the media would treat a similar incident involving a temple or Hindu saint differently, without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests an alternative explanation for the media's alleged silence, attributing it to bias against Hinduism and a preference for reporting negative news about temples and Hindu saints."}
