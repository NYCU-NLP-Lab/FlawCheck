{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement that the U.S. now has the \"lowest workforce since (President Jimmy) Carter.\" The size of the workforce has actually increased over the years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the comparison between Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter is valid, without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement about the workforce being the lowest since Carter.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the workforce has actually grown in size over the years, rather than being the lowest since Carter.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have an alternative explanation or interpretation, such as considering the civilian labor force participation rate instead of the absolute number of people in the workforce."}
