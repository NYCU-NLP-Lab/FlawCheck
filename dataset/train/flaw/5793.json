{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of NAFTA on job loss by stating that the U.S. lost 4.1 million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that NAFTA is solely responsible for the loss of manufacturing jobs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the loss of manufacturing jobs is directly caused by NAFTA, without considering other factors that may have contributed to job loss.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by highlighting the role of foreign companies manufacturing parts overseas and shipping them to Mexico and Canada for assembly, which is not directly related to NAFTA."}
