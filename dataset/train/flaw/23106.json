{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of individuals escaping high tax states by stating that $2 trillion in adjusted gross income has been taken with them. This may be an overestimation of the actual amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on estimates and data from a book by Travis H. Brown, but there is no specific information provided about the methodology or sources used to arrive at the $2 trillion figure. This lack of specific support raises questions about the reliability of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the movement of individuals from high tax states to low-tax states is solely motivated by tax rates. It does not consider other factors that may influence migration patterns, such as job opportunities, cost of living, or quality of life.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the migration patterns, such as demographic shifts, changes in industry, or other economic factors that may contribute to population movements."}
