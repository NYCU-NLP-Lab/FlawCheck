{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential negative impacts of vaping on the lungs, as there have been numerous reports of lung injuries associated with e-cigarettes and vaping.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that vaping legal medical cannabis products from New York state operators will not have negative impacts on the lungs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that vaping legal medical cannabis products is completely safe for the lungs, without considering potential risks or unknown long-term effects.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the public health concern regarding vaping stems from cases of lung injuries from vaping products purchased informally on the street, rather than from regulated medical marijuana products. However, this alternative explanation is not directly related to the claim itself."}
