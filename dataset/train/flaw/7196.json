{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Hillary Clinton is proposing \"destroying Medicare for seniors\" can be seen as an exaggeration. Health care experts suggest that Clinton's proposals, such as exploring cost-effective ways to make more health care providers eligible for telehealth reimbursement under Medicare and supporting letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare, are unlikely to jeopardize the program's continued existence for its core membership of those 65 and older.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Clinton's proposals would lead to the destruction of Medicare for seniors without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption. The expert's analysis suggests that the proposals are not likely to have such severe consequences.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that Clinton is proposing to destroy Medicare for seniors. The expert's analysis highlights the limited scope and non-controversial nature of Clinton's proposals, as well as the opinions of health care experts that these proposals would not endanger the program's future for its core membership.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's Medicare policy proposals. The expert's analysis suggests that there are plausible interpretations of her proposals that do not involve destroying Medicare for seniors."}
