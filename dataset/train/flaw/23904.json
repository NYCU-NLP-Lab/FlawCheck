{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of people who pay income tax in South Africa. The claim states that about 1.7 million people (roughly 3% of the population) pay 80% of income tax, but this could be an understatement if there are additional taxpayers who were not accounted for in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to verify the accuracy of the statement. The expert's verdict does not provide specific data or sources to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 1.7 million people who pay income tax represent the entire population of taxpayers in South Africa. However, there could be other taxpayers not included in this figure, which makes the claim's assumption problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the distribution of income tax payments in South Africa. It presents the 1.7 million people as the sole contributors to 80% of income tax, without exploring other potential factors or groups that may also contribute significantly to tax revenue."}
