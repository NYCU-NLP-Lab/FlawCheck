{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it states that the U.S. has a higher deficit with China now than before, which contradicts the fact that the trade deficit was smaller under Trump in 2019 compared to any of the final three years of the Obama administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement that the deficit with China is higher now.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that a higher deficit with China is inherently negative without considering other factors or implications.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as the U.S. deficit with China in goods and services improved under Trump between 2018 and 2019, although it still remains large in an absolute sense.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. trade deficit with China was smaller under Trump in 2019 than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration.", "Understate": "The claim understates the progress made under Trump in reducing the goods deficit with China in 2019, as it was similar to the level in 2016, the final year of the Obama administration."}
