{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of the beating Phool Singh Baraiya received, as it only states that he was \"thrashed by a crowd\" without providing specific details or evidence of the severity of the attack.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Phool Singh Baraiya was actually beaten by a crowd. The only information provided is a video being shared on social media, which may not be reliable or verifiable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Phool Singh Baraiya was beaten for making objectionable statements against Hindus, based on the video being shared. However, this assumption may not be accurate or supported by clear evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the video, such as it being a staged or manipulated video, or the attack being unrelated to Phool Singh Baraiya's statements. These alternative explanations should be considered before drawing conclusions from the video."}
