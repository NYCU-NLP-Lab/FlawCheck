{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the link between the vandalism at the mosque and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's new regime. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence of politically motivated vandalism and suggests that it was most likely the work of an inebriated individual.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to establish a clear connection between the vandalism and the new regime. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence of politically motivated vandalism and the mosque trustee also stated that they do not believe it was a politically motivated attack.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the vandalism is directly linked to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's new regime without sufficient evidence. The expert's verdict suggests that the vandalism may have been the work of an inebriated individual and not politically motivated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict presents an alternative explanation for the vandalism, suggesting that it was the work of an inebriated individual on the election night. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion of a link to the new regime."}
