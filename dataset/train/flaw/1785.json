{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the dominance of quarterbacks in winning the Super Bowl MVP award, as it states that quarterbacks have won more than 50% of the time, without providing the exact percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific statistical data or evidence to support the assertion that quarterbacks have won the MVP award more than 50% of the time. It only mentions that of the 47 Super Bowls, 26 quarterbacks have won the MVP, but does not provide the total number of MVP awards given to other positions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trend of quarterbacks winning the MVP award will continue in the future Super Bowls, without considering potential changes in the game or the emergence of exceptional players from other positions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the dominance of quarterbacks in winning the MVP award, such as the strategic importance of the quarterback position or the statistical impact they often have on the game."}
