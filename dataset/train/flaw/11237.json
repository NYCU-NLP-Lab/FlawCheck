{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which remaining in the EU gives the UK the right to send people from other countries home if they can't support themselves. The expert's verdict clarifies that remaining in the EU allows for border checks but does not necessarily grant the right to send people home based on their inability to support themselves.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the limitations on controlling EU migration if the UK remains in the EU. The expert's verdict explains that while the UK can carry out border checks, it cannot set limits on EU migration or stop EU citizens from coming to the UK if they meet certain conditions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that remaining in the EU gives the UK the right to send people from other countries home if they can't support themselves. The expert's verdict provides some context but does not provide specific evidence or references to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that remaining in the EU automatically grants the right to send people from other countries home if they can't support themselves. However, the expert's verdict highlights the complexities and limitations of EU membership regarding border control and free movement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not offer an alternative explanation as it focuses solely on the benefits of remaining in the EU regarding the right to send people home if they can't support themselves. The expert's verdict provides additional information about other aspects of EU membership and the potential implications of leaving or remaining."}
