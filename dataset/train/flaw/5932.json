The evidence provided shows that she threw a box.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman is a \"rioter\" based on the video footage, but there is no clear evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that the woman may have thrown the box for reasons other than aggression towards the police officers."}
