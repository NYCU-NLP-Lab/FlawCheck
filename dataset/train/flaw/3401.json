{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support from the World Health Organization (WHO) as there is no evidence of the WHO explicitly stating that South Africa was not ready to lift the lockdown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the WHO made a clear and definitive statement about South Africa's readiness to lift the lockdown, which is not supported by available evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation provided by the WHO representative to South Africa, who commented on transition guidelines and stated that South Africa did not meet WHO criteria to ease the lockdown. However, this alternative explanation is disputed due to the video being deleted and republished without the banner, suggesting incorrect titling.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that South Africa had already eased its national Covid-19 lockdown in April 2020 and implemented a risk-adjusted strategy.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the degree to which South Africa is following WHO guidelines, as the exact details of compliance are not provided.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing clear and consistent evidence to support the assertion that the WHO unequivocally declared that South Africa was not ready to lift the lockdown.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
