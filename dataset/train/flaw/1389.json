{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or documentation to prove that Adolf Hitler made the specific statement attributed to him in the meme.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by equating President Trump's tweet with a speech given by Adolf Hitler, without providing substantial evidence or context.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the similarity between Trump's tweet and Hitler's speech, which is that the wording was simply run through Google Translate and attributed to Hitler, rather than being an actual quote from him."}
