{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Watch Night church services began in 1862 with blacks in the U.S. awaiting the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation of New Year's Day, 1863. The expert's verdict mentions that the earliest attributed authorship has yet to be confirmed, indicating a lack of concrete support for this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Watch Night services are primarily celebrated in African American congregations and not in predominately White Christian churches. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there were instances where clergy in mainline denominations wondered about the propriety of linking religious services with a secular holiday like New Year's Eve, indicating that this assumption may not hold true in all cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the idea that Watch Night services originated specifically in response to the Emancipation Proclamation and the celebration of freedom from slavery. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Watch Night services have been celebrated for 141 years since that first Freedom's Eve, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations or historical contexts for the practice.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or downplay the significance of Watch Night services.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not exaggerate any information or overstate the significance of Watch Night services.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not directly contradict any known facts or present information that is demonstrably false.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times or show inconsistency in its presentation."}
