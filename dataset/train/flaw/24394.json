{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Hillary Clinton's stance on moving the United States to a single-payer system for health care. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Clinton supports a \"public option\" for Obamacare, which is not the same as a single-payer system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Hillary Clinton wants to go to a single-payer plan for health care. The expert's verdict mentions that some Democrats, including Barack Obama, pushed for a single-payer system, but there wasn't enough support for it. Additionally, the expert's verdict provides evidence that Clinton supports a \"public option\" instead.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a single-payer plan for health care would be a disaster without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The expert's verdict mentions Trump's statement that the Canadian system is slow and catastrophic in certain ways, but it does not provide comprehensive evidence to support the claim that a single-payer plan would be disastrous.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Clinton's stance on health care. The expert's verdict mentions that Clinton wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by Republicans and expand it to include tax credits, eliminate out-of-network charges, and reduce prescription drug costs. These alternative explanations suggest that Clinton's focus may be on improving and expanding the existing system rather than moving to a single-payer plan."}
