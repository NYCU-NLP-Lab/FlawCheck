{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of thoroughbred horses that need homes, stating that there are 52 of them, when in fact, this claim has been debunked as false.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the horses are not actually in need of homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The original plea for rehoming the horses was made in 2011, well before the pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that the horses are in immediate danger of being slaughtered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the son of the deceased owner wants nothing to do with the horses, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the situation, such as the possibility that the horses have already been rehomed or that the plea is outdated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by providing incorrect information about the current status and circumstances of the horses."}
