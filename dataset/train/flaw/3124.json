{"Exaggerate": "The claim of NASA finding a parallel universe is exaggerated as it is based on inaccurate conclusions drawn from the New Scientist article.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misinterpretation of research conducted at the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) and the conclusions drawn by other outlets are inaccurate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the abnormal detection of neutrinos by ANITA implies the existence of a parallel universe, which is a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations being discussed by physicists to explain the abnormal detection of neutrinos, suggesting that the claim may not be the only possible explanation."}
