The information given includes details about Clinton's draft records and military service, but it does not directly prove the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being a \"pardoned federal felon\" disqualifies someone from serving as President of the U.S. However, it does not provide any legal or constitutional basis for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the events described in the provided information, such as differing interpretations of Clinton's draft records or the reasons behind his reclassifications and actions during the Vietnam War era."}
