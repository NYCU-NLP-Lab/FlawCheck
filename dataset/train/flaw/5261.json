{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video shows President Obama kicking a reporter out of a press conference contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that the video actually shows President Obama dealing with a protester during a speech at an event celebrating LGBT Pride Month.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video that does not capture President Obama rejecting a reporter for asking a question he didn't like.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video in question shows President Obama kicking a reporter out of a press conference, which is a problematic assumption as it is not supported by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, stating that it shows President Obama handling a protester during a speech, rather than kicking out a reporter from a press conference."}
