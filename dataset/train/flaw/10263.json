{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the Nigerian Air Force is dropping weapons to Fulani herders in Enugu is contradicted by the expert's findings, which show that the accompanying photograph is not related to the claimed incident.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by alleging that the Nigerian Air Force is regularly dropping weapons to Fulani herders on a weekly basis, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies solely on a misleading photograph and a caption from a Facebook post, without providing any additional evidence or credible sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Nigerian Air Force is involved in supplying weapons to Fulani herders based on a single photograph and an unverified caption, without considering alternative explanations or conducting a thorough investigation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's findings suggest an alternative explanation for the photograph, indicating that it was taken during a military demonstration in 2018, rather than depicting the alleged incident of weapons being dropped to Fulani herders.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using a misleading photograph and an inaccurate caption to support its assertion, which undermines its credibility."}
