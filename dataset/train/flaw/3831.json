{"Contradict fact": "The claim that David Jolly \"has used money and power to try to \u2026 drill off our beaches\" contradicts the fact that Jolly has pushed back against offshore drilling in Congress.", "Understate": "The claim may understate Jolly's opposition to offshore drilling by ignoring his record of pushing back against it in Congress.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the accusation that Jolly has used money and power to try to drill off the beaches.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Jolly favors more drilling off the coast of Florida without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Jolly's actions and positions on drilling that are not considered in the claim."}
