{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which Adam Schiff has control over witness approval and questioning. The House resolution does not require questions of witnesses to first be approved by Schiff, and witness requests from ranking minority members must go through Schiff but the decision to allow them is not Schiff's alone.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the rules of the impeachment inquiry. It overstates Schiff's control and does not provide enough context about the process.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up its assertions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the rules of the impeachment inquiry are solely controlled by Adam Schiff, which is not accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the claim."}
