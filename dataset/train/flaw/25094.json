{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because there is a significant dispute over whether police shot John Crawford \"before he even knew what was going on.\" The accounts presented by the police officers involved contradict the claim made in the meme.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that Crawford was shot \"before he even knew what was going on\" due to the conflicting accounts and dispute over the events.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the officers fired immediately without giving any verbal commands and without giving Crawford any time to drop the bb gun, even if he had heard them. This assumption is based on the meme's account and may not be fully supported by the available evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation presented by the police officers involved, who asserted that Crawford failed to obey instructions to put down what they perceived to be a loaded rifle. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim made in the meme."}
