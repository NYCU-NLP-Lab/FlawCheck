{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that \"close to half of the children\" in California are \"at or near poverty,\" when considering the cost of living. The expert's verdict confirms that 45.8 percent of children in California are living at or near poverty, which is not exactly \"close to half,\" but still a significant proportion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by a July 2018 report on child poverty in California, which is cited by the expert. However, the claim does not provide any additional evidence or data to support the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high cost of living in California is the main factor contributing to the high child poverty rate. While it is acknowledged that the cost of living is considered in the California Poverty Measure, there may be other factors contributing to child poverty that are not addressed in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high child poverty rate in California. It solely focuses on the cost of living as the primary factor, without exploring other potential causes such as income inequality, lack of access to education or healthcare, or systemic issues.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it presents California as both \"the richest and poorest state.\" While it is acknowledged that there is a significant wealth gap in the state, the claim's wording might be seen as contradictory or confusing.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the child poverty rate in California. The expert's verdict confirms the claim's statement that 45.8 percent of children in California are living at or near poverty.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or evidence. The expert's verdict supports the claim's statement about the child poverty rate in California."}
