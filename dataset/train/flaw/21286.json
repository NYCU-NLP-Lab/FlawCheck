{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential risks and accidents associated with nuclear power plants by stating that the U.S. Navy has never had an accident.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the U.S. Navy has never had an accident with nuclear power plants.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the U.S. Navy's successful track record with nuclear power plants can be directly applied to commercial nuclear power plants without considering the differences in operation, regulation, and potential risks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the fact that there have been accidents involving nuclear submarines, although not directly related to problems with the nuclear reactors. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion of an accident-free record."}
