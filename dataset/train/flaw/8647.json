{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the cost difference between sending someone to jail and sending them to the University of Virginia. The expert's verdict points out that the claim is not as simple as it suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the cost comparison between jail and university.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that sending someone to jail is universally more expensive than sending them to the University of Virginia, without considering individual circumstances or factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations and factors to consider when comparing the costs of incarceration and university education, such as different types of prisons, state variations, and additional expenses associated with attending university."}
