{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of Nigerians living with diabetes, as the expert suggests that the actual number is \"much more\" than the reported five million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific data on new cases of diabetes in Nigeria or sub-Saharan Africa, making the claim unsubstantiated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of Nigerians living with diabetes is over five million, without providing concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in diabetes incidence in Nigeria, such as changes in lifestyle, diet, or access to healthcare, which are not explored in the claim."}
