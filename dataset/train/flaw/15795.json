{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the statement that 25% of people changed their email and phone habits because of the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act. It only refers to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Foundation, but the details of the survey and its methodology are not provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the change in email and phone habits is directly caused by the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act, without considering other factors that could have influenced people's behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why people might have changed their email and phone habits. It assumes that the sole reason is the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act, without considering other factors such as technological advancements or changing social norms.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Patriot Act was modified and limited in its scope after the Snowden revelations, suggesting that the data collection allowed by the Act might not have been the sole factor influencing people's behavior.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and concise explanation of the relationship between the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act and the change in email and phone habits. It relies on the statement of a single politician without providing additional context or analysis."}
