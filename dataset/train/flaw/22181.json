{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistic of white men accounting for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes accurately represents the demographic of white men specifically. However, the expert points out that the figure cited is for all whites, not just white men.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of determining the percentage of white men arrested for violent crimes, as the data does not allow for a direct comparison of race and sex simultaneously.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support for the statement that white men are \"just as dangerous\" as young Muslim and African-American men. The expert does not provide evidence to support this comparison.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the statistic for white men and violent crimes, as it mistakenly attributes the percentage to white men when it is actually for all whites and all crimes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that biases lead the press and the public to ignore the threat of violence from white men. However, the expert does not provide an alternative explanation for this perceived bias."}
