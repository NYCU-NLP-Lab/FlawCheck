{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the involvement of Congress in inviting Khalistan supporters, as it is stated that they \"let\" them in and that the Congress supported the protesters. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the protesters gatecrashed the event and that the Congress did not support them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Congress invited Khalistan supporters. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the protesters entered the event without Congress' knowledge or support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Khalistan supporters at the event implies Congress' invitation or support. However, the expert's verdict suggests that this assumption is misleading and that the Congress did not invite or support the protesters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation that the protesters gatecrashed the event, suggesting that the claim's assumption of Congress' invitation is incorrect."}
