{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the streetcar project on taking revenue away from Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS). The expert's verdict states that there isn't currently money flowing to MPS that will be choked off by the streetcar.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the streetcar project would take precious revenue away from MPS without providing sufficient evidence or explanation for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the assertion that the streetcar project would have a negative financial impact on MPS. The expert's verdict mentions that the primary source of funding for the project is a federal grant and various taxing districts, but there is no clear evidence or analysis provided to show how this would directly affect MPS revenue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the revenue generated from the increased property taxes within the taxing districts would go towards repaying the streetcar borrowing, rather than flowing to MPS. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that the streetcar project would take revenue away from MPS.", "Falters at times": "The claim made by Ald. Joe Davis Sr. falters in providing a clear and well-supported argument for how the streetcar project would harm MPS. The expert's verdict points out the lack of evidence and the problematic assumption in Davis' statement."}
