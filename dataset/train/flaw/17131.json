{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate by stating that Senator Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years. While his absentee rate is higher than the average, it does not necessarily make it the worst.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that Senator Rubio has the worst vote attendance record. It only compares his absentee rate to that of other senators without providing a comprehensive analysis.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a high absentee rate automatically indicates a lack of commitment to serving in the Senate. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to missed votes, such as conflicting responsibilities or scheduling conflicts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Senator Rubio's absentee rate, such as his involvement in the presidential campaign or other political commitments. The claim does not explore these possibilities.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of other senators' absentee rates by only focusing on Senator Rubio's record. It mentions other senators who had higher numbers of missed votes but argues that their absentee rates carry less weight due to the number of votes they had to miss.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear definition of what constitutes the \"worst vote attendance record.\" It only compares Senator Rubio's absentee rate to that of other senators without considering other factors that may impact their records.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict."}
