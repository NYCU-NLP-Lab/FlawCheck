{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of children already separated from their parents by stating \"over 2,000 children\" when the latest reports indicate that the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the executive order does address the issue of separating families by stating that it \"doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families.\" The executive order aims to maintain family unity and detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with the law.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not acknowledging the change in policy that led to the separation of families, which occurred in April 2018 when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement that the executive order \"doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that jailing children with their families is inherently problematic, without providing further reasoning or evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the executive order or acknowledge the administration's policy to maintain family unity and enforce immigration laws."}
