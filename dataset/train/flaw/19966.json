{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Nancy Pelosi would automatically become vice president if Joe Biden stepped down. The Constitution states that the vice president would become president and nominate a replacement, which would then need to be confirmed by Congress.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or explanation for why Nancy Pelosi would become vice president if Joe Biden stepped down.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Nancy Pelosi would automatically become vice president without considering the constitutional process outlined in the 25th Amendment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation to the claim by stating that if Joe Biden became president and later stepped down, Kamala Harris would become president and then nominate a new vice president, which would need to be confirmed by Congress."}
