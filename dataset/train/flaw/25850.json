{"Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that the authorities are only notified if a federal background check for a gun transfer is performed on someone whose name is on a terrorist watch list. It does not mention that the authorities are not automatically notified if someone on the watch list tries to buy a gun without a background check.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that authorities are always notified when someone on a terror watch list tries to buy a gun. It only mentions House Speaker Paul Ryan's statement without providing additional sources or information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being on a terror watch list automatically disqualifies a person from buying a gun, which is a problematic assumption. The fact that someone is on a watch list does not alone disqualify them from purchasing a firearm under the Brady Bill.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the claim, such as the possibility that authorities are not always notified if someone on a terror watch list tries to buy a gun, or that the notification process may vary depending on the state or jurisdiction.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the majority of people on terror watch lists have been allowed to purchase guns, as stated by the Government Accountability Office report. This contradicts the claim that authorities are always notified when someone on a watch list tries to buy a gun.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive overview of the procedures and processes involved in notifying authorities when someone on a terror watch list tries to buy a gun. It only presents limited information and does not address all possible scenarios or exceptions."}
