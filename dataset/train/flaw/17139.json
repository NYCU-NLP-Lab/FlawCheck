{"Exaggerate": "The claim of illegal aliens costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year is supported by a report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which estimates the cost to be even higher at $1.6 billion.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim actually understates FAIR's figure of $1.6 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict highlights the difficulty in estimating the costs of illegal immigration and the lack of nonpartisan sources with alternative fiscal estimates specific to Georgia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of illegal aliens to Georgia taxpayers is a significant burden without considering the potential economic contributions or benefits of immigrants.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is some consensus among studies that, when legal and illegal immigrants are considered together, they bring in more in taxes than they use over the long term. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the fiscal impacts of immigration."}
