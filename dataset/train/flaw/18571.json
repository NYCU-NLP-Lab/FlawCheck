{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the Obama administration \"didn't lock people in cages\" at the southern border, which is not entirely accurate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Obama administration did use similar structures to house minors who tried to illegally enter the U.S. without a parent or guardian.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or data to back up the statement that the Obama administration did not lock people in cages.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only way to lock people in cages is through a blanket policy of prosecuting parents, which may not be the only method of detaining individuals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the Obama administration did use similar structures to detain minors, but the circumstances may have been different from the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy."}
