{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the frequency of snowstorms, stating that they happen every 10 or 15 years when they may occur more frequently.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the severity and impact of the recent snowstorm by comparing it to previous snowstorms that did not have the same lingering impact.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to substantiate the frequency of the snowstorms.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the recent snowstorm was a \"perfect storm\" that only occurs every decade or so, without considering other factors that may have contributed to its severity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the differences in impact between previous snowstorms and the recent one, such as the presence of Arctic air blast after the snowfall."}
