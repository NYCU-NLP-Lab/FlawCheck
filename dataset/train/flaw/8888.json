{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Georgia having the lowest minimum wage in the country by not providing enough context about the percentage of workers affected.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that most hourly wage employees in Georgia are paid above the state's minimum wage, as they are covered under the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to demonstrate the economic disadvantage faced by workers in Georgia due to the state's minimum wage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that increasing the minimum wage will automatically result in Georgia becoming the best place to work, live, and raise a family, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for income inequality and high school graduation rates in Georgia, focusing solely on the minimum wage as a contributing factor."}
