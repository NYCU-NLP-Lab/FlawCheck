{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the average age of entry into prostitution is 12 to 14 years old. The expert mentions that statistics about sex trafficking, especially regarding minors, are notoriously difficult to document, and there is uncertainty about the sources and methodology behind the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average age of entry into prostitution applies to all trafficked prostitutes, including both adults and juveniles. However, it is not clear whether the statistic specifically refers to child sex trafficking or includes all forms of prostitution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert raises questions about the interpretation of the claim, such as whether a statistical average between 12 and 14 implies a significant number of individuals under 12 years old. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the claim.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may underestimate the severity or prevalence of child sex trafficking by focusing only on the average age of entry and not providing a broader context or additional statistics.", "Contradict fact": "While it is not explicitly mentioned in the expert's verdict, there is a possibility that the claim contradicts known facts or reliable research due to the challenges in accurately documenting statistics on sex trafficking.", "Falters at times": "The expert's analysis points out that the lead author of a cited study acknowledges the limitations of obtaining accurate data on the issue, suggesting that the claim may falter or lack certainty.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as the average age range provided falls within the realm of plausibility based on the limited available information. However, due to the lack of robust supporting evidence, it is difficult to determine if there is any exaggeration present."}
