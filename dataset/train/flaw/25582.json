{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that every mass shooting except two in America since 1950 have occurred in gun-free zones. The expert's verdict disputes this claim by providing evidence that contradicts this analysis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the source of the claim is identified as economist John Lott Jr., whose books and research have been criticized for bias and lack of rigorous methodology.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of law-abiding citizens with guns would prevent mass shootings. However, the expert's verdict points out that the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides and that the motive for choosing a location is often unrelated to gun policies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the choice of location in mass shootings, such as personal ties to the targeted place or workplace-related issues. This challenges the claim that gun-free zones are the primary factor in mass shootings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been instances of mass shootings in places where civilians are generally allowed to have guns, as evidenced by the International House of Pancakes shooting and the Gabrielle Giffords shooting mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a disputed analysis and questionable sources, which raises doubts about its accuracy and reliability.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and multifaceted nature of mass shootings by oversimplifying the role of gun-free zones as the main factor. The expert's verdict highlights the various motives and circumstances behind mass shootings, which go beyond the presence or absence of guns in a particular location."}
