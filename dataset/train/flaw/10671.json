{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Kasim Reed has kept every promise he made as a candidate, which is contradicted by evidence provided in the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or examples to back up the statement that Kasim Reed has kept every promise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all of Kasim Reed's promises were fulfilled without providing any evidence or analysis to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for some of the promises made by Kasim Reed, suggesting that they may not have been fully kept or may have been fulfilled in a different way than initially promised."}
