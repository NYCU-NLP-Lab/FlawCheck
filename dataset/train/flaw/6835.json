{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that the Senate Intelligence Committee has held \"more than double\" the number of public hearings compared to any recent year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of public hearings is directly correlated with increased transparency, without providing evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in public hearings, such as the specific circumstances surrounding the investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign, rather than a general increase in transparency.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of the increase in public hearings by not providing a clear comparison to previous years. It simply states that the committee met in public \"five or fewer times in nearly every year of the Obama administration,\" without specifying the exact numbers.", "Contradict fact": "None of the information provided contradicts the claim made in the statement.", "Exaggerate": "None of the information provided suggests that the claim is exaggerated.", "Falters at times": "None of the information provided suggests that the claim falters at times."}
