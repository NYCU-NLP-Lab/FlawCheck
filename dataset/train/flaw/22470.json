{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, but the expert's analysis shows that there are actually more than 12 states with gas prices above $2.00.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the statement. The expert's analysis, on the other hand, provides data from AAA and GasBuddy to support their findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00 in only 12 states, but the expert's analysis shows that there are actually more states with gas prices above $2.00.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists as the claim does not take into account the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on gas prices. The expert's analysis mentions that gas prices have been lower due to reduced demand during the pandemic.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are more than 12 states with gas prices above $2.00, as shown by the expert's analysis.", "Understate": "The claim may be considered as understating the number of states with gas prices above $2.00, as it only mentions 12 states while the expert's analysis shows that there are more.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be considered as faltering at times as it does not accurately represent the actual number of states with gas prices above $2.00, as shown by the expert's analysis."}
