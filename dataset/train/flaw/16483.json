{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it states that President Obama's inaction caused over three weeks to go by before he approved the governor's plan, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that federal agencies had been assessing the proposal since May 11.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that President Obama's inaction caused the delay in approving the governor's plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that President Obama's approval of the governor's plan was the sole factor in protecting the marsh and building sand barriers. It does not consider other factors or actions taken by different parties involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the delay in approving the governor's plan, such as the need for assessment and technical analysis by federal agencies or potential concerns raised by scientists about the long-term impact of building sand barriers.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that federal agencies had been assessing the proposal since May 11, which challenges the assertion that President Obama's inaction caused the delay.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by solely attributing the delay to President Obama's inaction, without considering other factors or challenges involved in implementing the governor's plan.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
