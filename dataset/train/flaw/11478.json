{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"voter fraud\" in Michigan and Wisconsin is not supported by evidence and may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion of voter fraud.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the early morning election results from Michigan and Wisconsin indicate voter fraud, without considering alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the increase in Democratic votes in Wisconsin and Michigan can be attributed to the release of a large batch of results from certain counties, rather than voter fraud. This alternative explanation is not considered in the claim."}
