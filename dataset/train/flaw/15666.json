{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documentation to support the assertion that a pizza delivery man played the piano part on the Bachman-Turner Overdrive hit \"Takin' Care of Business.\" The information provided is anecdotal and relies on personal accounts without any concrete proof.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pizza delivery man had the necessary musical skills to play the piano part on the recording. It is unclear how a pizza delivery person, without any prior knowledge or experience, would possess the ability to contribute a piano part to a professional recording.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of a piano part on the recording of \"Takin' Care of Business.\" It is possible that the band members themselves or someone else involved in the recording process played the piano, rather than a pizza delivery man.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the pizza delivery man's contribution by framing it as a remarkable and extraordinary event. The expert's verdict compares this story to other common urban legends that involve a stranger making a small but crucial contribution to a project.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in terms of consistency and reliability as it relies on personal anecdotes and interviews, which can be subject to memory lapses or inaccuracies. The expert's verdict mentions that the story has been corroborated by BTO singer-guitarist Randy Bachman, but the details and accuracy of these accounts are not thoroughly examined.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the complexity and skill required to play a piano part on a professional recording. It suggests that the band members thought they could simply erase the piano track after the delivery man left, implying that playing the piano is a simple task that anyone can do without further consideration.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence or factual basis provided to support the claim that a pizza delivery man played the piano part on the recording of \"Takin' Care of Business.\" Without concrete proof, the claim contradicts the established facts about the recording process and the involvement of professional musicians."}
