{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks support from the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which indicates that the claim is false.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Nancy Pelosi would automatically become vice president if Joe Biden is unable to serve his full term, which is not specified in the Constitution.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that while highly unlikely, Kamala Harris could theoretically choose Nancy Pelosi as her vice president, but it is not a guaranteed outcome.", "Understate": "The claim understates the requirements for appointing a subsequent vice president, which must be approved by a majority vote in both the House and Senate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the 25th Amendment and the section of the United States Code, which clearly state that the Speaker of the House would act as president in the absence of both the president and vice president, but not become vice president.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not fully considering the constitutional requirements and legal procedures for presidential succession."}
