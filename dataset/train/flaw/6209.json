{"Exaggeration": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration because it states that America's maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically as a result of Roe vs. Wade, when in fact the decline was already occurring prior to the ruling.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in maternal mortality rates can be solely attributed to the legalization of abortion, without considering other factors such as medical advancements and improved healthcare practices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Roe vs. Wade directly caused a significant decrease in maternal mortality rates. The provided data only shows a correlation between the ruling and the decline, but does not establish a causal relationship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The data presented suggests that the decline in maternal mortality rates could be attributed to factors other than the legalization of abortion, such as improved medical advancements and healthcare practices. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion."}
