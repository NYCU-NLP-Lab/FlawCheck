{"Exaggerate": "The expert suggests that the $10 billion figure stated in the claim is an overstatement.", "Lack enough support": "The expert questions the accuracy of the $10 billion figure and suggests that it may not be supported by sufficient evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the restoration of Texas' sales tax deduction directly resulted in Texas families keeping more than $10 billion in their family budgets, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests an alternative explanation by pointing out that if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS, implying that the savings may not solely be attributed to the restoration of the sales tax deduction."}
