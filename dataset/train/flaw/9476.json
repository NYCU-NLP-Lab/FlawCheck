{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the illustrated clocks in \"Goodnight Moon\" by stating that they document 70 minutes of the main character saying goodnight. The expert's analysis only provides evidence for a 10-minute time frame.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only relies on the observation of two illustrated clocks in the book without considering other factors or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the illustrated clocks accurately represent the passage of time in the story, which may not be the case as it is a fictional children's book.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of the clocks in the illustrations, such as purely decorative purposes or to create a visual element without representing actual time.", "Understate": "The claim understates the potential complexity and ambiguity of interpreting the illustrated clocks, as the expert's analysis only provides a rough estimation of time based on limited visual cues."}
