{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photograph shows Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau posing with a burning Canadian flag is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the image is a composite of at least two different images and that the photograph of the burning flag was taken several years before Trudeau became Canada's prime minister.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the situation by suggesting that Trudeau willingly posed with a burning Canadian flag, when in fact the image was manipulated and the original photograph showed him posing in front of a gravestone.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a manipulated image and does not provide any additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photograph is genuine and accurately represents Trudeau's actions, when in fact it is a manipulated image.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the image was digitally manipulated and created to criticize Trudeau, rather than being a genuine photograph of him posing with a burning Canadian flag."}
