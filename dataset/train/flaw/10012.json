{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the percentage of students who get the marks required to get into university. This bias is suggested by the expert's statement that 50% of students drop out of the education system, indicating that a significant portion of students may not even have the opportunity to reach the university level.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that only 30% of students get the required marks for university. Without further information or context, it is unclear how this percentage was determined or what sources were used to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that getting the required marks is the sole determining factor for admission into university. This assumption may overlook other factors such as competition for limited spots, financial constraints, or other admission criteria that universities consider.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why students may not get the required marks for university. Factors such as inadequate resources, poor teaching quality, or socio-economic disparities could also contribute to the low percentage mentioned in the claim."}
