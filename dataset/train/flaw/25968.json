{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that not much information about what the videos show has been confirmed, and that they have not been definitively linked to the new coronavirus. Therefore, there is a lack of enough support for the claim that the videos show people collapsing due to the coronavirus.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the assumption that these incidents were connected to the coronavirus is easy to make due to the heightened hysteria about an outbreak of an illness. This suggests that there is a problematic assumption being made in associating the videos with the coronavirus without concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the videos, such as a person being the victim of a traffic accident or a man suffering a head injury. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the events shown in the videos, which may contradict the claim that they are related to the coronavirus.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict mentions that the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that \"sudden collapses\" would be \"atypical\" for the coronavirus. This contradicts the claim that the videos show people collapsing due to the coronavirus.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the expert's verdict as they provide a balanced analysis of the videos and their potential connection to the coronavirus.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration bias in the expert's verdict as they provide factual information and do not overstate the significance of the videos.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence that the expert's verdict falters at times. They provide a detailed analysis and support their statements with information from the World Health Organization and social media reports."}
