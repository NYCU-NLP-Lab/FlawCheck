{"Understate": "The claim may understate the restrictiveness of New Jersey's medical marijuana program by stating that it is \"certainly\" the most restrictive, implying that there is no doubt about it.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that New Jersey is actually the most restrictive state in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed, and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the most restrictive state in these three categories is a positive or desirable thing without providing any evidence or argument to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why New Jersey's medical marijuana program may be perceived as the most restrictive, such as different interpretations of the laws or different approaches to implementation in other states."}
