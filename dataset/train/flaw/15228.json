{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which the Affordable Care Act has been waived or suspended. The expert's verdict mentions that there have been some significant changes and administrative adjustments to the law, but it is difficult to quantify the overall impact and determine if \"most of the law\" has been affected.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that \"most of the law has already in some sense been waived or otherwise suspended.\" The expert's verdict mentions that it is challenging to quantify the extent of the waivers or suspensions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the waivers or suspensions of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act imply that \"most of the law\" has been affected. However, the expert's verdict questions this assumption by asking what the core of the law is if not the suspended provisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the waivers or suspensions of certain provisions, such as administrative adjustments or modifications to address specific issues. It is not solely indicative of the entire law being waived or suspended.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the waivers or suspensions by using the phrase \"in some sense.\" The expert's verdict acknowledges that the changes have been significant and altered some provisions of the law, indicating a potentially greater impact than implied by the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in providing a clear and definitive statement about the extent of waivers or suspensions. The expert's verdict highlights the difficulty in quantifying the impact and determining the core of the law.", "Contradict fact": "No specific contradictory facts were identified in the expert's verdict."}
