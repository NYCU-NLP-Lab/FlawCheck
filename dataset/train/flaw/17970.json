{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Virginia has announced the end of youth hunting contradicts the fact that there have been no changes in state laws regarding youth hunting.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that there are still youth hunting days scheduled in Virginia and that all current laws and regulations pertaining to hunting are still in effect.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or announcement from the state government to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed gun control legislation would completely prohibit kids under 18 from shooting a gun, which is not the case according to a spokeswoman for the governor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The confusion regarding the age to shoot a gun in the claim is explained by the proposed gun control legislation, which aims to modify existing laws related to leaving loaded firearms unsecured around individuals under 18."}
