{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"$60 billion in 2010 in Medicare fraud\" may be an exaggeration, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported a figure of $48 billion for \"improper payments\" in 2010.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as the GAO report only provided an estimate based on a random sampling of Medicare claims and did not include questionable payments made under Medicare's Part D prescription drug program.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all improper payments are fraudulent, which may not be the case. The GAO report refers to \"improper payments\" rather than specifically fraudulent payments.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the improper payments in Medicare, such as errors or abuse in the system, rather than solely attributing it to fraud."}
