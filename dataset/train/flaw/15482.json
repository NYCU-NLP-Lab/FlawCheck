{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to verify its accuracy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shows Zimbabwe police dealing with a church that refused to close for the coronavirus, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the video, as it was previously shared on Twitter in November 2019, months before the coronavirus was confirmed in Zimbabwe. This suggests that the video may not be related to the current situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Zimbabwe has banned gatherings of more than 50 people to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. If the video shows police dealing with a church, it would indicate a violation of this ban.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the severity of the situation by focusing on a single incident involving a church, rather than providing a broader perspective on the measures taken by Zimbabwean authorities to enforce the ban on gatherings.", "Exaggerate": "It is unclear whether the claim exaggerates the situation, as the provided information does not give a clear indication of the scale or frequency of such incidents involving churches and the police."}
