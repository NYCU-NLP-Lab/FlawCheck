{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which State Department officials directed contracts for the Haitian recovery to friends of the Clintons, as there is no evidence that contracts were actually awarded.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that State Department officials directed contracts to friends of the Clintons.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the contact between the State Department and friends of the Clintons automatically translates into contracts being awarded to them, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the contact between the State Department and friends of the Clintons, such as seeking information or assistance rather than awarding contracts."}
