{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Sen. Claire McCaskill exaggerates her lack of contact with the Russian ambassador by stating that she had \"no call from, or meeting with, the Russian ambassador. Ever.\" This is proven to be false as she did meet with the ambassador on a previous occasion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Sen. McCaskill did meet with the Russian ambassador, despite her initial denial.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based solely on Sen. McCaskill's statement without providing any evidence or documentation to back it up.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of contact with the Russian ambassador is a significant point of contrast between Sen. McCaskill and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, without considering other factors or explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Sen. McCaskill's lack of contact with the Russian ambassador, which is that ambassadors typically call members of the Foreign Relations Committee rather than the Armed Services Committee, to which Sen. McCaskill belongs.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as Sen. McCaskill initially denied any contact with the Russian ambassador but later acknowledged that she did meet with him on a different occasion."}
