{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of the video by stating that it shows the people of Venezuela rejecting socialism and authoritarianism. The video is actually from a previous protest and does not represent the current unrest in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove its assertion that the video represents the current anti-Maduro protest. The expert's analysis shows that the video is from a different protest that took place in 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is evidence of the current protest demanding Maduro's resignation. However, the expert's analysis reveals that the video is unrelated to the recent events and was taken during a different protest with different demands.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge the alternative explanation that the video is not relevant to the current protest but is being shared to create a false narrative or mislead viewers."}
