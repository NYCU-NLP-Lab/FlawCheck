{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the percentage of eligible residents who have registered to vote. While the claim states that over 90% of eligible residents have registered, the expert's analysis suggests that the actual percentage is around 90.4% according to the county's tax assessor-collector and voter registrar.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim. The expert's analysis supports the claim's assertion that a high percentage of eligible residents have registered to vote.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is supported by the statements and data provided by Bruce Elfant, the county's tax assessor-collector and voter registrar. However, the expert's analysis points out that there were still unprocessed voter registrations at the time of the analysis, which may affect the final tally. Therefore, there may be a lack of enough support for the claim until all registrations are processed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim does not appear to rely on any problematic assumptions. It is based on the statements and data provided by Bruce Elfant.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no alternative explanation provided in the expert's analysis. The claim is supported by the statements and data from the county's tax assessor-collector and voter registrar."}
