{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual decrease in the number of GPs since last year, as the exact number is difficult to determine.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the government will recruit an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the government's promise to recruit 5,000 GPs by 2020 is achievable, without providing evidence or addressing potential challenges.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in the number of GPs, such as the undercounting of locum GPs in older figures."}
