{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the nature of the incident by stating that the woman was gang-raped and brutally murdered, without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides images of a beheaded woman without any additional information or evidence to verify the incident.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the images of the beheaded woman are recent and related to a gang-rape incident in Saharanpur, UP, without providing any concrete evidence or sources to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images are from 2017, as confirmed by a reverse image search and the Saharanpur police, which debunk the claim that they represent a recent incident.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the images, such as the possibility that they are unrelated to Saharanpur or that they depict a different incident altogether."}
