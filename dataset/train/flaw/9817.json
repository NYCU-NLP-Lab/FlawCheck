{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the legalization of marijuana in Spain. While it is legal to smoke marijuana for personal use in private spaces, the cultivation, manufacturing, trafficking, and promotion of marijuana are still illegal and punishable under the Spanish Penal Code.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Spain does not currently have a 32-hour workweek. While there is a proposed pilot program by a political party advocating for a shorter workweek, it is not yet implemented or widely accepted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to substantiate the legalization of marijuana and the implementation of a 32-hour workweek in Spain. The expert's verdict highlights that there is no new legislation on the legalization of marijuana in Spain, and the proposed pilot program for a shorter workweek is still being discussed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the legalization of marijuana and the implementation of a 32-hour workweek in Spain are already in effect, which is a problematic assumption given the lack of evidence and support for these claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that there might be confusion or misinformation circulating on social media platforms, leading to the spread of false information about the legalization of marijuana and the implementation of a 32-hour workweek in Spain."}
