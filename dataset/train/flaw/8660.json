{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or data to support the projection of Africa's growth dropping to 1.8% or lower. It is unclear what sources or methodology the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa used to arrive at this projection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the projection of Africa's growth dropping to 1.8% or lower is accurate and reliable. However, without sufficient evidence or supporting information, it is difficult to determine the validity of this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the former Nigeria vice president, Atiku Abubakar, criticized the current administration's plan to borrow nearly US$6.9 billion. This suggests that there may be differing opinions or perspectives on the economic outlook for Africa.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or provide alternative explanations for the projected drop in Africa's growth. It is possible that there are other factors or variables that could influence the economic situation in Africa, but these are not addressed in the claim."}
