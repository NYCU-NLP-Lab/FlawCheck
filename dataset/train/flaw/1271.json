{"Understate": "The expert's verdict understates the claim by stating that \"some\" service dogs are specially trained to seek help, implying that it is not a common or widespread behavior among service dogs.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict lacks enough support to fully verify the claim. While they mention that some service dogs are trained to seek help, they do not provide specific evidence or statistics to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict makes the assumption that all service dogs are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and are trained to take specific actions when needed. However, they acknowledge that not all service dogs have been trained to find help when needed, indicating that this assumption may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for a service dog approaching a stranger, such as the person being down and in need of help. This implies that the behavior of a service dog approaching a stranger may not always indicate a medical emergency.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that not all service dogs acquire the training to seek help during a medical emergency. This contradicts the claim that all service dogs will approach a stranger for help in such situations.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not falter at times, as it maintains a consistent stance throughout."}
