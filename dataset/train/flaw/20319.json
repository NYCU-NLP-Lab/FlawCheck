{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities. The expert's verdict mentions a study conducted by Drexel University associate professor Mark Stehr, but it does not provide detailed information about the study's methodology, sample size, or specific findings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between easing alcohol sales laws on Sundays and an increase in traffic crashes and fatalities. However, the expert's verdict mentions that past studies have reached mixed conclusions, and many of them were outdated or focused solely on one state. This suggests that the assumption may not be universally applicable or supported by solid evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in alcohol-related crashes in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, occurred before the implementation of campaigns advising motorists not to drink and drive. This alternative explanation suggests that factors other than changes in alcohol sales laws may have influenced the increase in crashes, casting doubt on the claim's assertion.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear if there is a direct contradiction of fact in the claim, as the provided information does not offer concrete evidence or statistics to either support or refute the claim. However, the expert's verdict mentions that past studies have reached mixed conclusions, which could suggest a contradiction of fact depending on the specific findings of those studies.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not explicitly falter at any specific point, as it simply states a potential consequence of easing alcohol sales restrictions on Sundays. However, the lack of detailed evidence or data weakens the claim's overall strength and reliability.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim, as it does not make any specific quantitative or qualitative claims that can be compared to objective data.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim, as it does not make any specific quantitative or qualitative claims that can be compared to objective data."}
