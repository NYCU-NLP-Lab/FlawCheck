{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the GOP Georgia senator's plan offers no details on how protections for people with preexisting health conditions would be ensured. This indicates a lack of support for the claim that her plan would protect Americans with preexisting conditions.", "Understate": "The expert's verdict states that two provisions in the plan indicate protections will be less than those provided by the Affordable Care Act. This suggests that the claim may be understating the level of protection offered by the plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that previous GOP alternatives have fallen short of Obamacare's protections for people with prior health problems. This suggests that the claim may be making a problematic assumption that the new plan will adequately protect Americans with preexisting conditions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict includes statements from experts who argue that there is nothing in the Loeffler plan that indicates she would support the policies necessary to protect Americans against insurer discrimination. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim that her plan would ensure protections for people with preexisting conditions.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict highlights that the existing Affordable Care Act guarantees that people with health problems can buy their own insurance without paying more than healthier consumers, and it prevents insurance companies from excluding patients with preexisting conditions. This contradicts the claim that Loeffler's plan would ensure protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, as it suggests that the protections provided by the ACA are already in place."}
