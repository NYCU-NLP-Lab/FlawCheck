{"Understate": "The claim may understate the decrease in undocumented workers crossing the border by stating that it is only at a 12-year low, when in fact, it is also the lowest level in decades.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully verify the decrease in undocumented workers crossing the border, as there is no perfect comprehensive measure of people entering the U.S. illegally.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in Mexican border detentions is representative of all undocumented immigrants, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in border crossings, such as the impact of the Great Recession or changes in border security measures.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that in 2011, there were slightly fewer border-crossers reported by Border Patrol agents in the southwestern border, which challenges the claim of the lowest level in 30 years.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and consistent picture of the decrease in undocumented workers crossing the border, as different sources and years are mentioned, creating inconsistencies."}
