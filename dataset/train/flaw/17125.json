{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in the percentage of rejected ballots between the current election and previous elections.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the low number of rejected ballots is not possible and suggests nefarious activity without sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the rejection rate for signature issues is \"almost zero\" in the current election.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the rejection rate for signature issues in the current election is similar to previous elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the increase in the number of rejected ballots, such as the higher number of mail-in ballots cast in the current election compared to previous elections."}
