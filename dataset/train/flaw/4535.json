{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Tommy Thompson wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only cites two liberal sources that are not directly related to Thompson's budget plan.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Thompson wants to give a tax cut to millionaires and raise taxes on the middle class without providing concrete evidence or Thompson's explicit stance on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Thompson's tax plan that are not explored in the claim."}
