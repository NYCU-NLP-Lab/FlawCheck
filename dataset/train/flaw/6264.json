{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact and classification of COVID-19 as a pandemic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence that the CDC removed the term \"pandemic\" and replaced it with \"outbreak\" on its website homepage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the change in terminology on the CDC website means COVID-19 was never a pandemic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the use of the term \"outbreak\" on the CDC website does not negate the classification of COVID-19 as a pandemic."}
