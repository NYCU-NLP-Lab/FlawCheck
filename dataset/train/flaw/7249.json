{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that demonstrators erected a cross at the Capitol, when in fact the cross was erected at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that a cross was erected at the Capitol.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by not specifying which \"Capitol\" it is referring to, leading to confusion and potential misinterpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have an alternative explanation as it is possible that the cross was raised as a part of a different protest or rally, unrelated to the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th."}
