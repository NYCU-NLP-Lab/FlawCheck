{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of secondary schools in northern Nigeria by stating that there are up to 10 primary schools for every secondary school. Recent data suggests that the ratio is actually half of the World Bank's estimate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on outdated data and an erroneous audit that was retracted by the basic education commission.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of secondary schools in northern Nigeria is significantly greater than in other regions. However, the claim should have specified that it refers to public schools only.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the World Bank's estimate of 80% of poor households in Nigeria being in northern states is unproven.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the lack of secondary schools in northern Nigeria by not considering the full data on senior secondary schools, as they are not considered part of basic education.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lack of secondary schools in northern Nigeria that are not addressed in the claim."}
