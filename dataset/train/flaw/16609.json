{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the percentage of health care premiums that most state employees pay.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that most state employees could pay twice as much towards their health care premiums.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the higher-premium plan, which some state employees pay about 15 percent of the cost, is used by just a tiny fraction of state government workers. This suggests that not all state employees pay only about 6 percent.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of all plans and coverage options for state employees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that doubling the amount state employees pay towards their health care premiums would still be half the national average, without providing evidence or justification for this assumption."}
