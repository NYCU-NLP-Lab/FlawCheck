{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lack of discussion about the national debt and the economy during the debate. The expert's verdict states that there was some discussion about the debt and little about the economy, indicating that the claim may have exaggerated the extent of the issue.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of discussion that actually took place about the national debt and the economy during the debate. The expert's verdict acknowledges that there was some discussion, suggesting that the claim may not fully capture the extent of the conversation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that there was no discussion about the national debt and very little about the economy. This lack of support makes the claim vulnerable to criticism.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of discussion about the national debt and the economy is a problem. While it may be a valid concern, the claim does not provide a clear argument or reasoning for why it is problematic, leaving room for alternative perspectives.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that the media's refusal to discuss substantive issues is the reason for the high polling numbers of \"outsider\" candidates. However, this explanation may overlook other factors that contribute to the popularity of these candidates, such as dissatisfaction with establishment politics or their ability to resonate with certain voter demographics."}
