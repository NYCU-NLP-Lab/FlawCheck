{"Exaggerate": "The claim of having \"almost a billion dollars\" in active development projects may be an exaggeration, as the provided evidence shows that the total value of the listed projects is $981.7 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a project list provided by the mayor's press secretary, which includes projects that are \"recently completed, under construction, or in the pipeline.\" The claim does not provide specific details or evidence for each project.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the listed projects are active and contribute to the total value mentioned. However, the evidence suggests that some projects were already completed or opened before the mayor's speech.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the total value of the listed projects. The evidence does not provide a breakdown of the costs or a detailed analysis of the projects, leaving room for alternative interpretations or explanations."}
