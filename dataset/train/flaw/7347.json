{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that a significant portion of ballots had yet to be counted in several counties after the California primary.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that a large share of ballots had yet to be counted in several counties.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the delay in counting the ballots is problematic or suspicious, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the delay in counting the ballots is due to the process of rounding up and certifying mail-in and provisional ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the delay in counting the ballots was not a coverup, as the announcements about outstanding ballots were public.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing a clear explanation of whether the final tally would deviate significantly from the initial totals used to \"call\" the state.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which a large share of ballots had yet to be counted, as there is no official word on how many remained at the time."}
