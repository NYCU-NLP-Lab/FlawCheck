{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of sanctuary city policies on violent crime by stating that cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don't. The expert's verdict indicates that the research cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not support this conclusion.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that data and research on sanctuary cities and their impact on crime is limited. Therefore, the claim may lack sufficient evidence to support its assertion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between sanctuary city policies and increased violent crime. However, the expert's verdict states that the researchers found that sanctuary policies do not affect crime rates either way, suggesting that the assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are alternative explanations for the correlation between sanctuary city policies and violent crime, such as the presence of a large population of undocumented immigrants in these cities. This suggests that the claim may not consider other factors that could contribute to the observed correlation.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the research cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not support the conclusion that sanctuary cities have more violent crime on average.", "Understate": "There is no clear indication of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
