{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image was manipulated to make it look like Charles Manson was behind President Trump, not Jesus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the image was widely circulated by the president's supporters when there is no evidence to support this.", "Understate": "The claim understates the lack of support for the claim by mentioning that a handful of Trump supporters may have shared the image by accident, but not providing any significant evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no record of the image being shared on the social media pages of the Republican National Convention, the White House, or the GOP.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump supporters mistook Manson for Jesus without providing substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the image was manipulated and circulated by individuals who are not Trump supporters."}
