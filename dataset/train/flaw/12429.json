{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Biden is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the Biden administration is committed to ensuring that safe, effective, cost-free vaccines are available to the entire U.S. public, regardless of immigration status. This indicates that the claim may be exaggerating the situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans in the vaccine queue. It relies on a statement from a representative and a spokesperson, but without further evidence or data, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that allowing immigrants access to the vaccine means they are being invited to step in front of American citizens in the queue. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the Biden administration's position is to ensure that all people in the United States, regardless of immigration status, have access to the vaccine. The assumption made in the claim may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the Biden administration's goal is to ensure the safety of all people in the country, including undocumented immigrants, by providing access to the vaccine. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that allowing immigrants access to the vaccine means they are jumping ahead of other Americans."}
