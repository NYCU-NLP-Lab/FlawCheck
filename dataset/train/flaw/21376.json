{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of HR 1 by stating that it would \"legalize\" the kind of fraud found in North Carolina. The expert's verdict states that there is nothing in HR 1 that would loosen ballot collection rules or legalize adding votes to a ballot.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that HR 1 would legalize the specific type of fraud found in North Carolina without providing enough evidence or support for this assumption. The expert's verdict states that there is no provision in HR 1 that would absolve North Carolina's political operatives of wrongdoing.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that HR 1 would legalize the kind of fraud found in North Carolina. The expert's verdict states that there is no mention or provision in HR 1 that would address or legalize ballot harvesting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the fraud found in North Carolina, instead solely attributing it to the potential impact of HR 1. The expert's verdict mentions that the fraud in North Carolina was a result of a coordinated and unlawful absentee ballot scheme, not related to HR 1."}
