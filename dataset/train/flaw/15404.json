{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video shows the body of Saddam Hussein 12 years after his death is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the claim is false.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided in the expert's verdict to verify the authenticity of the video.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video indeed shows the body of Saddam Hussein, but there is no substantial evidence or verification to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the video is actually a longer version of the funeral and burial ceremony of Saddam Hussein, which was published on YouTube in 2007.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the significance of the video by suggesting that it shows the body of Saddam Hussein intact and glowing even after 12 years, without providing substantial evidence to support such a claim."}
