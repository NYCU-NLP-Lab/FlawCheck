{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the Supreme Court's ruling by stating that \"illegal aliens ... do not, in effect, possess the right to sue anyone in case they feel abused or mistreated.\" The expert's verdict confirms that this is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support its assertion that the Supreme Court made such a ruling. The expert's verdict also mentions that the story does not cite any specific case or provide any sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally do not have the same rights as natural-born or naturalized U.S. citizens. This assumption is not supported by the expert's verdict, which states that the Supreme Court has not ruled against the right of immigrants to sue if mistreated.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a biased perspective that supports President Trump's position on immigration. The expert's verdict mentions that the story was published on websites known for spreading fake news and that it was flagged as potentially fake by Facebook users. This suggests that there may be alternative motivations for promoting this false claim."}
