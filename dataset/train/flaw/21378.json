{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed wants to be like Bull Connor based on his actions towards Occupy Atlanta movement supporters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or examples to support the comparison between Mayor Reed and Bull Connor.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative reasons or motivations behind Mayor Reed's actions towards the Occupy Atlanta movement supporters that are not explored in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the similarity between Mayor Reed's actions and the actions of Bull Connor by making a direct comparison without considering the differences in context and severity.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance and impact of Bull Connor's actions during the civil rights era, as it only briefly mentions his brutal tactics without delving into the full extent of his actions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mayor Reed has spoken about his goal of making Atlanta a city that is not too busy to love, suggesting that his actions towards the Occupy Atlanta movement supporters may not align with this goal."}
