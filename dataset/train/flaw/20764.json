{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"COVID-19 started because we eat animals\" lacks enough support as there is no evidence to suggest that eating meat is the source of the coronavirus outbreak.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by linking COVID-19 to meat consumption without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the origin of COVID-19, such as the possibility of it originating in bats and then jumping to another animal host before spreading to humans.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the origins of COVID-19 by simplifying it to a single cause (eating animals).", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that scientists are still trying to determine the exact source of COVID-19 and there is no evidence to support the claim that meat consumption caused the outbreak.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of meat consumption in the spread of COVID-19 by stating that the virus would not exist if the world was vegan, which is not supported by evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on baseless claims and misinformation, such as linking the disease to the consumption of bats in China without sufficient evidence."}
