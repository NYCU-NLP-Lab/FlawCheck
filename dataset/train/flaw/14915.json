{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 2011 measure passed with Wendy Davis' support completely removes the attorney general's ability to settle lawsuits, which may not be entirely accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to fully validate the statement that the 2011 measure removes the attorney general's ability to settle lawsuits.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the attorney general's inability to settle lawsuits, such as legislative approval requirements that were in place before the 2011 measure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the legislative leash on the attorney general's ability to settle cases originated in 2007, not in 2011 as stated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear and accurate representation of the timeline and details regarding the attorney general's ability to settle lawsuits.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the 2011 measure on the attorney general's ability to settle lawsuits, as it may not completely remove the ability but rather impose certain limitations."}
