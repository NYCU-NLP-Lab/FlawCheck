{"Exaggerate": "The claim slightly exaggerates the number of gun-related homicides per day in America. The expert's verdict states that the actual number is slightly lower than the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the number of gun-related homicides per day, as it slightly overstates the figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the claim of 34 people being murdered by gunfire every day.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of gun-related homicides per day is an \"unacceptable and largely correctable epidemic\" without providing evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to gun-related homicides, such as socio-economic factors, mental health issues, or illegal firearms."}
