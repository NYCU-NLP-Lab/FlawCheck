{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it states that \"more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence\" since the Sandy Hook tragedy.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times because it includes deaths of 18 and 19-year-olds in the category of children, which some may argue is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all gun deaths among children are a result of gun violence, without considering other factors such as accidents or suicides.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the statistic, such as the inclusion of accidental gun deaths or deaths resulting from factors other than violence."}
