{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of illegal immigrants booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. It states \"nearly 200,000\" when the actual number is over 130,000.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the data provided pertains to all immigrants, both legal and illegal, not just illegal immigrants.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the claim that these immigrants were responsible for \"more than half a million criminal offenses.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that all immigrants who were charged with a crime are responsible for the charges, without considering the possibility of false accusations or wrongful arrests.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the criminal offenses, such as socio-economic factors or other demographic variables, which are not addressed in the claim."}
