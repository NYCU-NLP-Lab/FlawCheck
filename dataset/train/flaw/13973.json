{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the use of Arabic numerals in public schools, suggesting that there is a specific order from the California governor to implement them, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its validity. The expert's verdict provides evidence to debunk the claim and states that it originated from a satirical website.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of Arabic numerals in public schools is a controversial or significant issue, which is not supported by any evidence or context.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hindu-Arabic numerals are already taught in schools, including in California, along with the alphabet.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim."}
