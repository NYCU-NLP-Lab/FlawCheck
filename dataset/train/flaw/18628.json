{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the average American is working through the month of May just to pay off the government is an exaggeration according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They argue that the \"typical\" American would pay off taxes much sooner.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the average American is working until May to pay off taxes.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all income earned by the average American goes towards paying taxes, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that the claim fails to consider the progressive tax system in the United States, where higher-income individuals pay a higher tax rate. This alternative explanation suggests that the burden of taxes is not evenly distributed among all Americans."}
