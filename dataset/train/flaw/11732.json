{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that the national debt is greater than the gross domestic product without providing concrete evidence or specific data to support this assertion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a reference to a blog post from the Atlantic magazine and a blog post from the Concord Coalition, but it does not provide any additional sources or data to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the national debt is directly comparable to the gross domestic product without considering other factors or alternative explanations that may impact the relationship between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the relationship between the national debt and the gross domestic product that are not considered in the claim."}
