{"Understate": "The claim states that college tuition has increased by 28 percent in the past 10 years, but the expert's verdict reveals that the increase has actually been higher, around 72 percent for public four-year colleges and universities.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the statement of a 28 percent increase in college tuition. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, cites inflation-adjusted figures released by the College Board to provide more accurate information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a 28 percent increase in college tuition is already a significant burden for middle-class families. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the actual increase has been even higher, which may further exacerbate the financial challenges faced by these families.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore any alternative explanations for the increase in college tuition. The expert's verdict provides additional information on the increase in tuition and fees, attributing it to inflation-adjusted figures and the College Board's report.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the increase in college tuition has been higher than 28 percent, as evidenced by the expert's verdict."}
