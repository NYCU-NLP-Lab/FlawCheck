{"Exaggeration": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the timing of the notification by describing it as \"at the last minute in midnight phone calls.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the Czech Prime Minister was informed shortly after midnight, which suggests that the timing was not necessarily last minute.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that notifying Poland and the Czech Republic about the cancellation of the missile-defense facilities through midnight phone calls is diplomatically inappropriate. However, this assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the notification was made through midnight phone calls. It is solely based on the statement made by Dick Cheney.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the timing of the notification or the method used. It assumes that the decision was made without consultation or consideration for the strategic plans and promises made to Poland and the Czech Republic."}
