{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the Senate Republican tax plan on the number of people losing health insurance. While the claim mentions that 13 million people would be affected, the expert's verdict clarifies that the number of people who would voluntarily give up their health coverage is not specified.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the Senate Republican tax plan would result in 13 million people losing health insurance. The expert's verdict explains that the estimate of 13 million fewer people having coverage is based on the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's penalties for not purchasing health insurance, but it does not necessarily mean that all 13 million would be kicked off their insurance plans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 13 million people would be \"booted\" or kicked off their health insurance plans, which the expert's verdict clarifies is not the case. Many people would voluntarily give up their health coverage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the decrease in the number of people with health insurance, stating that it would occur mainly because healthier people would be less likely to obtain insurance without the individual mandate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all 13 million people would be kicked off their insurance plans, as clarified by the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the Senate Republican tax plan by stating that it would \"boot\" 13 million people from the health insurance rolls. The expert's verdict explains that the estimate is based on the elimination of penalties for not purchasing health insurance and does not necessarily mean that all 13 million would lose coverage.", "Falters at times": "It is not clear if the claim falters at times as there is no specific evidence or information provided in the expert's verdict to suggest this bias."}
