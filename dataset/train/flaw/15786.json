{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of border patrol agents by stating that there are more agents than at any time in history, when in fact, the biggest increase in staffing occurred under President George W. Bush.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in border patrol agents under President Obama by stating that the increase has only been about 3 percent per year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in the flow of undocumented immigrants, such as economic factors or changes in border enforcement strategies."}
