{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded with impunity. The expert explains that the claim misinterprets the ruling and that it actually refers to the Illinois Constitution and the laws of the Municipal Court of Chicago, not the U.S. Constitution.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the restrictions that can be imposed on citizens' rights during a health crisis. The expert mentions that the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that the rights of a citizen can be restricted by the state for the \"common good\" during such situations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded. The expert explains that the cited case, Ex parte Milligan, does not support the claim, as it was about disputed judicial authority during the Civil War, not stay-at-home orders.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 1866 Supreme Court ruling mentioned supports the idea that stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded. However, the expert clarifies that the ruling does not address stay-at-home orders or their legality.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation by mentioning that governors have faced legal challenges to the legality of their stay-at-home orders in various states, suggesting that there are differing interpretations of the law."}
