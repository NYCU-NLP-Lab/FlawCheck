{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Hillary Clinton traveling with a doctor carrying a Diazepam pen in case she has a seizure. The evidence to support this claim is flimsy and non-existent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Hillary Clinton travels with a doctor carrying a Diazepam pen.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Secret Service agent seen with Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention is a doctor carrying a Diazepam pen. However, there is no substantial evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the presence of the Secret Service agent, such as the agent being a regular security detail rather than a doctor."}
