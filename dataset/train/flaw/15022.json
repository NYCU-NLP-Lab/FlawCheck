{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Thom Tillis gives tax breaks to yacht and jet owners. The expert's verdict states that the tax code changes preserved the existing tax breaks for boats and aircraft, which includes a broader category than just yachts and jets.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of the tax breaks on yacht and jet owners. The expert's verdict mentions that the tax breaks were preserved, but it does not provide specific information on the extent of the breaks or any potential benefits received by yacht and jet owners.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to conclusively prove that Thom Tillis gives tax breaks to yacht and jet owners. The expert's verdict mentions that supporters of Kay Hagan make this claim, but it does not provide concrete evidence or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may be based on a problematic assumption that tax breaks for yacht and jet owners are inherently negative or indicative of being out-of-touch with average families. The expert's verdict mentions that supporters of Kay Hagan argue that giving tax breaks to yacht and jet owners shows Tillis' out-of-touch nature, but it does not provide a balanced analysis of the potential reasons or justifications for such tax breaks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the tax code changes in 2013 reduced taxes for everyone, but more so for wealthier people than lower-income people. This alternative explanation suggests that the tax breaks for yacht and jet owners may be a result of broader tax code changes rather than a specific action by Thom Tillis."}
