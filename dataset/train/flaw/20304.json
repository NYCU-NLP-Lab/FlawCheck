However, the expert's verdict mentions that the claim is in the ballpark, suggesting that there may be some presidents who do not fit this definition.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that previous presidents, such as Harry Truman and Richard Nixon, did try to expand healthcare to all Americans. The expert's verdict provides evidence of their attempts.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the efforts made by previous presidents to expand healthcare to all Americans. The expert's verdict mentions that Truman proposed a national health insurance plan and Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all or nearly all Americans.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the success of Barack Obama in expanding healthcare to all Americans. The expert's verdict mentions that Obama succeeded where his predecessors had failed, suggesting that previous presidents were not able to achieve the same level of success.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lack of success in expanding healthcare to all Americans by previous presidents. The expert's verdict mentions caveats and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for their failures.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the efforts made by previous presidents to expand healthcare to all Americans.
