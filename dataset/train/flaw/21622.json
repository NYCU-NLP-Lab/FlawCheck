{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the effectiveness of chloroquine by stating that it has cured 12,552 coronavirus patients in China. The expert's verdict provides more context and states that the drug has been found to have \"a certain curative effect\" but does not explicitly mention a cure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that chloroquine has cured 12,552 coronavirus patients in China. The expert's verdict mentions that the drug was put to clinical trials, but it does not provide specific details or results of those trials.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the effectiveness of chloroquine in China can be directly applied to other countries, such as Nigeria. The expert's verdict mentions that chloroquine is a popular drug in Nigeria due to its use for malaria treatment, but it does not provide evidence to support the assumption that it can cure coronavirus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the popularity of chloroquine in Nigeria, such as its use for malaria treatment. This implies that the claim's assertion of chloroquine's effectiveness against coronavirus may not be the only reason for its popularity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that chloroquine has been banned in Nigeria since 2005 and again in 2017. The expert's verdict mentions this ban and highlights that the drug is still popular in the country despite being prohibited.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim and expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
