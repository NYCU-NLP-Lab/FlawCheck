{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that one out of every 30 people in the Greater Boston area is an illegal alien, which implies a high proportion.", "Lack enough support": "Although the claim is supported by data from the Pew Research Center and the Census Bureau, the margin of error in the estimates could be seen as lacking enough support to make a precise statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all unauthorized immigrants in the Boston area are \"illegal aliens,\" which may be a problematic assumption as it does not account for individuals with different immigration statuses.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of unauthorized immigrants in the Boston area, such as economic factors or family ties.", "Understate": "While the claim is largely accurate, it may also be seen as understating the actual number of unauthorized immigrants in the Greater Boston area, as the estimate provided is based on 2014 data and may not account for any changes in population since then."}
