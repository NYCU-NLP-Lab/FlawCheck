{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the amount of money leaving Missouri for Texas by stating that \"more than $40 million\" are leaving annually, while the expert's analysis shows that the net loss to Texas alone totaled $791.3 million over a span of 18 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to substantiate the statement that \"$40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State\" annually.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all the dollars leaving Missouri are going directly to Texas, without considering other potential destinations or factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis suggests that the movement of adjusted gross income between states is not necessarily a direct transfer of dollars, as it depends on how taxpayers report their income in different states.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing the full context or mentioning that the figures are based on adjusted gross income, which may not directly represent the actual dollars leaving Missouri for Texas."}
