{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time\" lacks sufficient supporting evidence or data. The expert mentions that national numbers on police marksmanship are not readily available and only provides limited data from the New York Police Department.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the accuracy of trained police officers is directly comparable to that of volunteer teachers. However, there is no evidence or data provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that accuracy levels for police officers vary depending on the distance to the target and whether suspects return fire. This suggests that there may be alternative factors influencing police hit rates, such as the circumstances of the encounter or the level of threat faced.", "Falters at times": "The expert notes that while some data supports the claim that police hit rates are below 30 percent in certain situations, other data refutes this point. This indicates that the claim may not hold true in all cases and may falter or be inconsistent.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is limited available data on national police marksmanship and only provides specific data from the New York Police Department. This contradiction suggests that the claim may not be based on comprehensive or representative evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration since it states that trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time without providing a clear and comprehensive basis for this assertion."}
