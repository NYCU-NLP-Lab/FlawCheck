{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Obama's early records are \"sealed\" by using the term \"sealed\" which implies a level of secrecy and cover-up that is not accurate.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that many records of presidential candidates remain confidential, but they are not \"sealed\" by a court.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Obama's early records are \"sealed\" as it is not supported by evidence or specific examples.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the lack of release of certain records by Obama implies something derogatory or suspicious.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the records the claim refers to as \"sealed\" are either public and open for anyone to see or are normally private documents that Obama, like other presidential candidates, hasn't released."}
