{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they asked the DPS to elaborate on McCraw's claim about \"illegal aliens\" appearing in statute, but did not receive a response. This lack of further information or evidence to support the claim suggests a potential lack of enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that McCraw claims \"illegal aliens\" is a legal term, in statute, and a federal term. However, there is no further information or evidence provided to support this claim, which could indicate a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that many news organizations avoid using the term \"illegal alien\" and that the Associated Press dropped it from its stylebook. This suggests that there are alternative explanations or perspectives on the use of the term, indicating the existence of alternative explanations."}
