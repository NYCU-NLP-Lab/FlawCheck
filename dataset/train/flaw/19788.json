{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Hillary Clinton supports \"unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.\" While Clinton supports the right to choose and has advocated for access to safe reproductive health care, the claim exaggerates the extent of her support by implying there are no limits or restrictions.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the rarity of abortions in the weeks leading up to birth. The expert's verdict mentions that only 1.3 percent of abortions occurred in the 21st week or later in 2012, indicating that late-term abortions are relatively uncommon. However, the claim does not provide this context and implies that such abortions are more prevalent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that Hillary Clinton supports \"unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.\" It does not provide specific examples or references to Clinton's statements or policies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting access to safe reproductive health care and advocating for the right to choose necessarily means supporting \"unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth.\" This assumption oversimplifies the complex issue of abortion and disregards potential nuances in Clinton's stance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations for Clinton's position on abortion. It presents her support as extreme and radical without considering other factors that may influence her stance, such as a commitment to reproductive rights or a belief in a woman's autonomy over her own body."}
