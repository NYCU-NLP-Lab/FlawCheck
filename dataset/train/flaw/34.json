{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the potential reduction in global average temperature that could be achieved through the full implementation of the Paris Agreement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Paris Agreement would only reduce the global average temperature by 0.2 degrees Celsius, without considering alternative assumptions or studies that suggest greater reductions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the Paris Agreement would only have a minimal impact on global temperature.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Other studies and researchers make different assumptions and calculations, leading to varying estimates on the potential temperature reduction under the Paris Agreement."}
