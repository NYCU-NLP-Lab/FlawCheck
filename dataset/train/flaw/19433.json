{"Understate": "The claim understates the fact that individual cities and counties in Florida, Georgia, Idaho, South Dakota, and Tennessee have orders in place that mandate face coverings, even though there is no statewide mandate.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being \"mask free\" means there are no requirements at all for wearing face masks, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that these states are \"mask free\" as it does not provide any evidence or data.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are orders in place in various cities and counties within these states that require face coverings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the claim is a result of misinformation or misunderstanding, as it fails to acknowledge the local mandates in place."}
