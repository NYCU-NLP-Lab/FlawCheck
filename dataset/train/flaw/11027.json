{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the differences in state and federal benefits between marriage and domestic union contracts. The expert points out that benefits for civil unions are not as comprehensive as those for marriage and vary from state to state.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that replacing marriage licenses with domestic union contracts does not alter state or federal benefits. The expert provides evidence that civil unions are not recognized by the federal government and are not eligible for most federal benefits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that domestic union contracts are the legal equivalent of marriage and would provide the same benefits. However, the expert highlights that there is no other state that recognizes the term \"domestic union\" and that it is not defined at the federal level.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert presents alternative explanations by mentioning existing terminology such as \"domestic partnerships\" and \"civil unions\" that were utilized by same-sex couples prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage. These alternatives have different recognition and benefits compared to marriage."}
