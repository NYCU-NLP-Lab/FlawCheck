{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Florida's ranking in spending on education by stating that it is in 50th place, when it is actually ranked 31st in one source and 38th in another source.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Florida is in 50th place in spending on education.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that ranking in spending on education is the sole indicator of the quality of Florida's public education system, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Florida's ranking in spending on education, such as regional cost differences or the equitable distribution of school dollars, which are not addressed in the claim."}
