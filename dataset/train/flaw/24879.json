{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that 80 percent of impeachments in Missouri have been against judges. The expert's analysis highlights the need for further investigation to determine the accuracy of this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high percentage of impeachments against judges in Missouri is a cause for concern or indicative of a lack of checks and balances within the judiciary branch. This assumption may not be valid without additional context or evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that prior to 1945, all impeachments in Missouri were launched by the House and tried by the Senate, including cases against the governor. The constitutional amendment in 1924 transferred the authority to try most impeachment cases to the Supreme Court. Therefore, the claim that 80 percent of impeachments have been against judges may not accurately reflect the historical impeachment process in Missouri.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim understates the percentage of impeachments against judges in Missouri, as it only considers a list of 10 impeachment cases from 1825 to present. There may be additional cases that were not included in this list, which could affect the overall percentage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why judges may be impeached at a higher rate in Missouri. It is important to explore other factors that could contribute to this statistic, such as the nature of judicial misconduct or specific circumstances surrounding individual cases.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in providing a comprehensive analysis of the impeachment process in Missouri. The expert's analysis highlights the complexities and historical changes in the process, suggesting that the claim oversimplifies the issue."}
