{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the progress made on border enforcement by stating that there are more boots on the southern border than at any time in history.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that illegal crossings have been reduced to their lowest levels in 40 years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in illegal crossings is solely attributable to the administration's efforts on border enforcement, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in illegal crossings, such as changes in economic conditions or enforcement strategies."}
