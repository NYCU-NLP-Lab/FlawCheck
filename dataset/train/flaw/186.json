{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the issue by stating that broken voting machines in Russellville, Ark., automatically tallied votes meant for Donald Trump as votes for Joe Biden. The expert's verdict clarifies that only one machine froze and prevented a voter from casting his vote for Trump, and there was no evidence of votes being automatically tallied for Biden.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the machine never recorded or looked like it would record a vote for Biden. The expert's verdict confirms that the touch-screen froze, preventing the voter from scrolling to vote for Trump, but there was no indication of any vote being recorded for Biden.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post and a local Fox-affiliate report. The expert's verdict provides additional details and clarifications that challenge the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident with the broken voting machine represents a larger issue with the voting process or the reliability of all voting machines. The expert's verdict states that the incident was isolated and does not imply any broader problems with election security or the functionality of other machines.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times without more specific information. However, the expert's verdict points out the discrepancies between the claim and the actual incident, suggesting that there may be inconsistencies in the claim's accuracy.", "Exist alternative explanation": "It is unclear if there is an alternative explanation presented in the claim. The expert's verdict provides the explanation that the issue was caused by inadvertent touches due to a large number of candidates displayed on the machine, contradicting the claim's assertion of intentional tallying of votes for Biden."}
