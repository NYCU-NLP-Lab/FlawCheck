{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of cost as a barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining health insurance. The expert's verdict mentions that survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier, with 40% of uninsured respondents citing cost as the main reason for not having health insurance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to fully substantiate the assertion that the expense is the sole reason why uninsured Americans didn't buy insurance. While Sen. Rand Paul states that \"half of them made more than $50,000 a year\" and \"because of the expense,\" the expert's verdict suggests that further analysis is needed to verify these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the expense is the only factor preventing uninsured Americans from buying insurance. However, the expert's verdict mentions that there are other factors to consider, such as employment-related issues or the perception of not needing insurance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why uninsured Americans did not buy insurance. The expert's verdict mentions that employment-related factors, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn't offer health insurance, were also cited as barriers to obtaining coverage."}
