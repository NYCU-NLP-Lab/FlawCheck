{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that President Trump exaggerated when he claimed that his administration had deported MS-13 gang members \"by the thousands.\" The actual number of deportations is in the hundreds, not thousands.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the White House declined to comment on the number of gang members removed under the Trump administration. This lack of information makes it difficult to support the claim that thousands of MS-13 gang members have been deported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deportation of MS-13 gang members has occurred \"by the thousands,\" without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in gang member deportations in fiscal year 2017 compared to the previous year could be attributed to various factors, not just Trump's policies. Therefore, there may be alternative explanations for the increase in deportations."}
