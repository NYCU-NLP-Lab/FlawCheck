{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Thai pro-democracy protesters threw objects at the royal motorcade. The expert's analysis of the photographs and videos did not identify any objects being thrown.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs show Thai pro-democracy protesters throwing objects at the royal motorcade, but the expert's analysis contradicts this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim by stating that no objects were seen being thrown at the royal motorcade in the provided photographs and videos.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the alleged incident by simply stating that objects were thrown at the motorcade. The expert's analysis suggests that no objects were thrown at all.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the actions of the protesters by alleging that they threw objects at the royal motorcade. The expert's analysis indicates that there is no evidence to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's analysis presents an alternative explanation by suggesting that the protesters were making gestures of defiance, rather than throwing objects at the motorcade.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting misleading information and images that do not align with the expert's analysis."}
