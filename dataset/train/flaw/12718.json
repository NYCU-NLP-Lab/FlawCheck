{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to prove that the dog in the photograph is indeed Hercules, the world's biggest dog. The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph circulated without any accompanying explanation, and there is no direct connection between the image and the real Hercules.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the dog in the photograph is Hercules, the world's biggest dog, without providing substantial proof or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the dog in the photograph may not be an English Mastiff like Hercules but rather a Neapolitan Mastiff, which could indicate that the image is either digitally manipulated or a freakishly large example of its breed.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the dog in the photograph does not match the appearance of the real Hercules, as shown in newspaper photographs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the ambiguity of the term \"biggest dog\" by using it to mean \"heaviest dog\" rather than considering other factors such as height. This is mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or clarification about the dog in the photograph being Hercules, as mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
