{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Franklin Roosevelt was not the last president to come to Congress to ask for permission to engage in war. Other presidents, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, have sought authorization from Congress for military actions.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that other presidents have sought authorization from Congress for military actions, implying that it was only Franklin Roosevelt who did so.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or examples of other presidents seeking authorization from Congress for military actions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that other presidents have also sought authorization from Congress for military actions, but it may not have been as well-known or widely discussed."}
