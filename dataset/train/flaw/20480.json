{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the significance of missed extra points by stating that there were only five missed out of over 1,200 attempts. This downplays the potential impact and importance of missed extra points.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that the extra point is \"almost automatic.\" It only provides the number of missed attempts without providing a comprehensive analysis of success rates or other relevant factors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rarity of missed extra points justifies the proposal to change the scoring system. However, it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the proposed change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the proposal to spike the extra point and add excitement to the game. It only presents the perspective of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell without considering other viewpoints or potential reasons for the proposed change."}
