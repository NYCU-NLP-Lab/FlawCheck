{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Monica Petersen was killed after discovering the Clinton Foundation's involvement in a child sex trafficking ring in Haiti. The evidence presented comes from secondary sources and not from Petersen herself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Petersen's death is directly connected to her alleged discovery of the Clinton Foundation's involvement in a child sex trafficking ring, without providing any concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that Petersen's death was tied to a conspiracy theory about the Clintons killing off their political foes, which is not substantiated by any credible evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the official cause of Petersen's death has not been announced as of the time of the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the situation by oversimplifying it into a single cause-and-effect relationship between Petersen's alleged discovery and her death.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Petersen's alleged discovery by presenting it as a \"smoking gun\" that connects various conspiracy theories and criticisms of the Clinton Foundation's work in Haiti.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on secondary sources and attributing messages to Petersen without clear evidence that she shared or wrote them."}
