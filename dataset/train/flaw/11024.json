{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating when it states that Susie Lee and her husband \"own 17 homes across the country and use their private jet to take vacations.\" The expert's investigation confirms that they do own multiple properties, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim about their use of a private jet.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Susie Lee's wealth comes from \"questionable investments\" in companies like Walmart, Halliburton, and GEO Group. The expert's investigation only confirms that she has investments in these companies, but does not provide further details or evidence to label them as \"questionable.\"", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents the investments in Walmart, Halliburton, and GEO Group as problematic, but it does not consider alternative explanations for why Susie Lee may have invested in these companies. The expert's investigation does not explore the motivations behind these investments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Susie Lee's wealth and investments are negative attributes that disqualify her from representing the values of the union. This assumption is not supported by the expert's investigation, which merely presents the facts without making a judgment on their implications.", "Contradict fact": "No contradictions to factual information are apparent in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay the significance of Susie Lee's wealth and investments.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not seem to falter or make inconsistent statements."}
