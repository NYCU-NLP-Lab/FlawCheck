{"Lack enough support": "The claim that abortions are decreasing is supported by state and federal figures indicating a decrease in the number of abortions. However, the evidence provided is limited to data from Texas and the CDC, which may not be representative of the entire country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that everyone wants to reduce abortion, which may not be true for all individuals or groups.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the issue by only focusing on the decrease in the number of abortions without considering other factors that could contribute to this trend.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in abortions, such as changes in contraception use or access to reproductive healthcare.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any factual information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not exaggerate the decrease in abortions, but it also does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times, as it is supported by the provided evidence."}
