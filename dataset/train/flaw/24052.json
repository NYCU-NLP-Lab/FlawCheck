{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment lacks enough support because there is no evidence that she has ever said she wants to repeal or abolish it. She has consistently affirmed her support for the right to bear arms.", "Problematic assumption": "Gun rights advocates argue that it is reasonable to infer from a few comments that Clinton wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it is currently interpreted. However, this assumption is problematic as it is not supported by Clinton's consistent statements affirming her support for the Second Amendment.", "Exist alternative explanation": "While Clinton has called for stronger regulations and common-sense gun-safety measures, she has also consistently expressed her belief in the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. Gun rights advocates and experts may interpret her comments differently, but there is an alternative explanation to the claim that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment."}
