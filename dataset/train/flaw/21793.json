{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the pandemic by suggesting that Woodstock took place without any significant disruptions or precautions during the 1968 flu pandemic. It fails to mention any potential health risks or precautions taken during the event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Woodstock took place in the middle of a pandemic. While there are references to the 1968 flu pandemic and the presence of doctors at Woodstock, there is no direct evidence or data provided to establish a causal link between the pandemic and the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of doctors at Woodstock to address potential health threats implies that the event took place during the pandemic. However, it is possible that the doctors were present as a precautionary measure or due to concerns about other illnesses common in large gatherings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the presence of doctors at Woodstock, such as concerns about general health and safety at a large gathering, rather than specifically related to the 1968 flu pandemic. The claim does not explore or acknowledge these alternative explanations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Woodstock took place in August 1969, whereas the 1968 flu pandemic occurred in 1968. This discrepancy undermines the claim's assertion that Woodstock took place during the pandemic.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which Woodstock and other businesses operated normally during the 1968 flu pandemic. It suggests that \"nothing closed\" and all businesses continued to operate, which may not accurately reflect the level of disruption and precautionary measures taken during the pandemic.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and consistent narrative about the relationship between Woodstock and the 1968 flu pandemic. It presents conflicting information, such as Woodstock being planned in January 1969 during the \"worse period of death,\" which does not align with the timeline of the pandemic."}
