{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of Janice Hahn by suggesting that she hired hardcore gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists' and helped them get out of jail to commit further crimes.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Janice Hahn actually hired gang members with taxpayer money and assisted them in getting out of jail.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hiring ex-gang members as gang-intervention specialists automatically leads to them committing crimes such as rape and murder again, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Janice Hahn's actions, such as the potential effectiveness of gang-intervention programs or the possibility that hiring ex-gang members could help reduce gang violence."}
