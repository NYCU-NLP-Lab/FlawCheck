{"Contradict fact": "The claim that there is no correlation between the increase in sea level and carbon emissions contradicts the expert's verdict, which states that global sea level rise is primarily driven by factors directly related to global warming, including the expansion of oceans due to warmer water and the melting of ice sheets.", "Exaggerate": "The claim made by Brooks that erosion and sediment deposits are the \"far and away\" number one cause of sea level rise exaggerates the importance of these factors compared to the scientific consensus that attributes sea level rise primarily to global warming.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or scientific research to back up the assertion that there is no correlation between sea level rise and carbon emissions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that erosion and sediment deposits are the main cause of sea level rise without considering the overwhelming scientific evidence that points to global warming as the primary driver of rising sea levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for sea level rise, attributing it to factors such as the expansion of oceans due to warmer water and the melting of ice sheets, which are directly related to global warming."}
