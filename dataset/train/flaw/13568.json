{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Mitt Romney wants to increase the defense budget by stating that he wants to add $2 trillion that the military hasn't asked for. The expert's verdict, however, suggests that Romney's plan aligns with the goal of reaching a 4 percent floor of GDP for defense spending, which could result in a $2.1 trillion increase over ten years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the military has not asked for the additional $2 trillion in defense spending proposed by Mitt Romney. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Romney's plan aligns with the goal of various budget think tanks and experts, suggesting that the military's needs are being considered.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to prove that Mitt Romney's proposed increase in defense spending is unnecessary. The expert's verdict provides some analysis and context, but it does not extensively address the military's actual needs or the potential consequences of the proposed increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Mitt Romney's proposed increase in defense spending. The expert's verdict provides some context and explanation for Romney's plan, but it does not explore alternative motives or factors that may contribute to his stance on defense spending."}
