{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or research to support the assertion that \"up to 45 percent\" of illegal immigrants are visa overstayers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all visa overstayers are classified as illegal immigrants, which may not be accurate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the presence of visa overstayers, such as individuals who unintentionally overstayed their visas due to extenuating circumstances.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the percentage of illegal immigrants who are visa overstayers, as it only mentions \"up to 45 percent\" without providing a more precise estimate.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some illegal immigrants do physically cross the southern or northern border, suggesting that all illegal immigrants are visa overstayers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the prevalence of visa overstayers among illegal immigrants by stating that \"up to 45 percent\" fall into this category without providing concrete data or research to support this claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the various factors contributing to illegal immigration, such as border crossings versus visa overstays."}
