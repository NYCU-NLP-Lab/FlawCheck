{"Contradict fact": "The claim states that the videos of Akshay Kumar and Virat Kohli are in relation to the Kathua and Unnao rape cases, but the expert's verdict reveals that they are actually in reference to a different incident of molestation in Bengaluru on New Year's Eve in 2016. This contradicts the fact presented in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim provides evidence of the videos being circulated on social media and reported by news channels, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to support the claim that the videos are related to the Kathua and Unnao rape cases. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the videos of Akshay Kumar and Virat Kohli are expressing their views on the Kathua and Unnao rape cases without providing any direct evidence or statements from the celebrities themselves. This assumption is problematic as it is based on the interpretation of the videos without clear confirmation from the individuals involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the videos, stating that they are actually in reference to a different incident in Bengaluru. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim's assertion that the videos are related to the Kathua and Unnao rape cases."}
