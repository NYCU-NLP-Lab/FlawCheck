{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Barack Obama permanently stopped military aid to Ukraine, when in fact the Obama administration did provide extensive military and security aid to Ukraine, though not lethal weapons.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Obama never allowed military aid to go to Ukraine.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the impeachment inquiry is solely about whether Trump temporarily withheld aid, when in reality it also involves allegations of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Obama's decision to not provide lethal military aid to Ukraine, which includes concerns about escalating the conflict with Russia and the reluctance of key allies to send weapons into the conflict zone."}
