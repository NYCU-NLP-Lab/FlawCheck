{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of living near wind turbines by stating that it is noisy enough to make someone \"go crazy after a couple of years.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that the noise levels and impact on mental health are not as extreme as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that living near wind turbines is noisy enough to have such a severe impact on mental health. The expert's verdict provides evidence from studies that contradict this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that living near wind turbines is inherently noisy and detrimental to mental health without considering alternative explanations or factors that may contribute to noise levels or mental health issues. The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations and evidence that challenge this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the noise levels and impact on mental health associated with living near wind turbines, such as the design, height, or location of the turbines. This challenges the claim's assertion that the noise alone is responsible for negative effects on mental health."}
