{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Apple and Amazon already operate in many states that require levels of voter ID.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of Apple and Amazon in states with voter ID laws is relevant to their decision to open a new project or headquarters in North Carolina.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative reasons why Apple and Amazon operate in certain states with voter ID laws, such as business opportunities or market demand, rather than a deliberate choice based on the voter ID laws."}
