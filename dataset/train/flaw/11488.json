The claim only mentions $4 million a year, but there may be additional funds involved.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate the $4 million figure. The evidence provided only mentions the state comptroller's agreement to provide $25 million a year, but it does not specifically mention the amount that the Austin City Council may contribute.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving $4 million a year to subsidize a race track is the wrong priority. This assumption may be subjective and open to interpretation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the Austin City Council may give money to subsidize the race track. It does not explore potential benefits or reasons behind the decision."}
