{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the extent to which Scott Walker favors cutting off families and children from health care. The expert's verdict suggests that Walker had initially supported limiting time on the state health care program, but later clarified that he meant time limits on the welfare-to-work program, not BadgerCare.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Scott Walker actually favors cutting off 350,000 families and children from health care. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made by a political action committee backed by organized labor and Democratic associations, which suggests a potential bias.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Scott Walker's support for limiting time on BadgerCare translates to favoring cutting off families and children from health care. However, the expert's verdict indicates that Walker clarified his position and stated that he misspoke, intending to refer to time limits on the welfare-to-work program instead.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for Scott Walker's statements, stating that he misspoke and meant to refer to time limits on the welfare-to-work program rather than BadgerCare. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's assertion that Walker favors cutting off families and children from health care."}
