{"Understate": "The claim states that New York is \"below the national average in number of deaths in nursing homes.\" However, the expert's verdict provides data showing that nursing home deaths in New York account for 28 percent of confirmed fatalities, which is below the national average of 35 percent. This suggests that the claim may be understating the severity of nursing home deaths in New York.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the statement that New York is below the national average in nursing home deaths. The expert's verdict, on the other hand, provides data from the Health Department and comparisons to national data from the CDC and KFF. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support to be considered reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being below the national average in number of deaths in nursing homes is a positive indicator of the handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes. However, the expert's verdict does not address whether this is an accurate or appropriate measure of the administration's handling of the virus in nursing homes. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why New York may have a lower percentage of deaths in nursing homes compared to other states. The expert's verdict provides additional context, such as the undercounting of nursing home deaths in the state's data and the exclusion of deaths that occurred in hospitals. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the lower percentage of nursing home deaths in New York."}
