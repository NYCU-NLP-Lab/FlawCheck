{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the statement that the photographs show a collection of houses built in unusual places. Without further information or verification, it is difficult to determine the authenticity or uniqueness of the houses depicted in the photographs.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the photographs are all genuine and depict real structures built in unusual places. However, the expert's verdict reveals that the collection is divided between genuine photographs and digital manipulations. This assumption is problematic as it overlooks the fact that some of the images may be fabricated or digitally altered.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the origin of each image, classifying them as either \"Fabricated\" or \"Real.\" This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the photographs, indicating that not all of them depict actual houses built in unusual places.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the nature of the collection. It presents the photographs as a cohesive collection of houses built in unusual places, but the expert's verdict reveals that the collection is divided between genuine photographs and digital manipulations. This inconsistency suggests that the claim may not accurately represent the content of the photographs.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the presence of digital manipulations in the collection. While it mentions that the collection consists of both genuine photographs and digital manipulations, it does not provide the exact ratio or proportion of each. The expert's verdict indicates that five out of eleven entries are digital creations, suggesting a significant presence of manipulated images that may be understated in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that not all of the photographs depict real structures built in unusual places. The expert's verdict clearly states that some of the images are digital creations from Photoshop contests, indicating that they are not real or genuine."}
