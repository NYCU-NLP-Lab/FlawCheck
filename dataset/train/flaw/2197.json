{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the event by stating that a baseball player using an axe as a bat cut the ball in two with his swing and knocked half of it over the fence, scoring half a run and winning the game. This is an extraordinary and unlikely event.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the occurrence of the event. The only evidence provided is a first-person account from former minor league pitcher William \"Wild Bill\" Setley, which is given 44 years after the fact.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the account provided by Setley is accurate and reliable, without questioning the credibility or potential bias of the storyteller.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the story combines elements from a well-known urban legend and a real-life 1894 Allentown game, indicating that there could be alternative explanations for the event described in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of credibility and reliability due to the time lapse between the event and the account provided, as well as the reputation of Setley as a \"great story teller.\"", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that a baseball player could cut a ball in two with an axe swing, as it goes against the laws of physics and the design of a baseball bat.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
