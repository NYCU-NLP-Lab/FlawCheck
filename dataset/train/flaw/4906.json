{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the incident by stating that the girl had a \"Joker smile\" carved into her face, which is not accurate.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the incident occurred as described.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incident is related to a white genocide in South Africa, which is a problematic assumption without proper evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the image, stating that it is a reappropriated image of a girl who was attacked by a dog, rather than being intentionally harmed by \"savages\" as claimed."}
