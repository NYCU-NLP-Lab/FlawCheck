The expert's verdict acknowledges that some safety precautions have been implemented in Wisconsin, although they may not be as comprehensive as in neighboring states.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the executive orders by the governors of neighboring states played a significant role in implementing safety precautions. However, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that Wisconsin Republican lawmakers have done nothing in comparison.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of safety precautions in Wisconsin is solely due to the inaction of Republican lawmakers. The expert's verdict mentions tensions and clashes between Republicans and Democrats over what actions to take, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the lack of certain safety precautions in Wisconsin may be due to the reliance on executive orders by the governor, rather than legislation passed by lawmakers. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that Wisconsin Republican lawmakers have done nothing.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that some safety precautions have been implemented in Wisconsin, albeit potentially not to the same extent as in neighboring states.
