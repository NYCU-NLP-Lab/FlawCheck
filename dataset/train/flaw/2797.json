{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the assertion that Burj Khalifa showed an image of Rohit Sharma after IPL 2020. The only evidence provided is a viral image and social media posts, but there is no official confirmation or credible source to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viral image showing Rohit Sharma on Burj Khalifa is authentic and not manipulated or falsely created. There is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the viral image, such as it being a photo manipulation or a fan-created image. The comparison with a similar image from 2016 and the presence of similar blue lights on Burj Khalifa on other occasions suggest that the image may not be unique to Rohit Sharma.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing consistent evidence or supporting information. The sources cited include social media posts, a fan tweet, and a Telugu YouTube channel, but none of them provide concrete proof of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the significance of having an image displayed on Burj Khalifa. It compares Rohit Sharma's supposed honor to that of Mahatma Gandhi and Shah Rukh Khan, but there is no official confirmation or widespread recognition of this honor.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no official confirmation or credible evidence to support the assertion that Burj Khalifa displayed an image of Rohit Sharma after IPL 2020. The lack of any tweet related to Rohit Sharma or Mumbai Indians uploaded by Burj Khalifa on Twitter further contradicts the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may potentially exaggerate the significance of the viral image and its association with Rohit Sharma. Without concrete evidence, it is premature to make claims about the honor and recognition received by Rohit Sharma on the same level as Mahatma Gandhi and Shah Rukh Khan."}
