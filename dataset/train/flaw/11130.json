{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the importance of the State of the Union address by suggesting that it was supposed to be delivered by a specific date (Feb. 20), when in reality there is no set timeline for when the address should be given.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Joe Biden was supposed to deliver the State of the Union address by Feb. 20. The provided information states that there is no set timeline for the address and that previous presidents have not delivered it in their inauguration year.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the State of the Union address does not have a fixed date and can be delivered at the discretion of the president."}
