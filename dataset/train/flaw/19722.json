{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak \"has banned the use of an anti-malaria drug that might help cure coronavirus.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the regulation restricts the prescription of chloroquine in outpatient settings, but not in hospitals and emergency rooms. It is not a complete ban.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide evidence or sources to back up the statement that the anti-malaria drug might help cure coronavirus.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the anti-malaria drug can help cure coronavirus without providing sufficient evidence or scientific consensus to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or reasons for the restriction on the prescription of chloroquine, such as preventing hoarding and ensuring access for patients who need the drug.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the regulation is not a ban, as clarified by the expert's verdict. The claim presents it as a ban, which is not accurate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misrepresenting the actions of Gov. Sisolak as a ban when it is a restriction. This misrepresentation can lead to a misunderstanding of the situation.", "Understate": "There is no clear understatement bias present in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
