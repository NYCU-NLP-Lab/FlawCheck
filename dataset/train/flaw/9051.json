{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent of the rodent infestation by stating that properties owned by Jared Kushner in the Baltimore area have \"accrued multiple building code violations for rodent infestation.\" Without specific evidence, it is difficult to determine the severity and frequency of the violations.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Jared Kushner's properties have accrued multiple building code violations for rodent infestation. It does not provide specific details or sources to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rodent infestation in Jared Kushner's properties is directly related to the criticism of Baltimore as a \"rat and rodent infested mess.\" While there may be a connection, the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal link.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the building code violations or the rodent infestation in Jared Kushner's properties. There could be various factors contributing to the violations, such as maintenance issues or tenant behavior, which are not explored in the claim."}
