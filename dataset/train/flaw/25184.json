{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that it is possible to \"get away with murder\" in the Zone of Death.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or legal precedent to support the assertion that crimes can go unpunished in the Zone of Death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the disputed boundaries within Yellowstone National Park create a legal loophole that allows for crimes to be committed without punishment. However, this assumption is disputed and not supported by legal precedent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that there are limits and restrictions that would apply even if the loophole were upheld, which indicates the existence of alternative explanations and limitations to the claim."}
