{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the involvement of the SDPI in placing the flag atop the Shankaracharya statue, as the police investigation found that the accused was not associated with the party.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the police investigation and press release state that the flag does not belong to the SDPI and the accused is not associated with any political party or organization.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the flag atop the statue belongs to the SDPI based on the involvement of some SDPI members in the Bengaluru riots, without sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by the police investigation, which states that the accused took the banner from a mosque to seek cover from heavy rainfall and it was not a premeditated act."}
