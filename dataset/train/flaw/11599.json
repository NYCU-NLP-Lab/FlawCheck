Al Sharpton confused deficits and debt during his show, indicating a lack of understanding or clarity in his statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the national debt has been reduced every year for the last five years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that reducing the deficit automatically leads to a reduction in the national debt, which is not necessarily the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert provides alternative explanations by clarifying the difference between deficits and debt and presenting data showing the actual increase in the national debt during Obama's presidency."}
