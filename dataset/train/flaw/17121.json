{"Understate": "The claim may understate the situation by stating that Pence \"provides zero state funding for homeless shelters\" without considering alternative sources of funding or the actions of previous governors.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully validate the statement that Pence provides zero state funding for homeless shelters.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The lack of state funding for homeless shelters in Indiana is not unique to Pence and has been consistent under both Republican and Democratic leadership, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the lack of funding."}
