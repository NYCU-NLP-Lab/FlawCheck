{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to prove that the \"try to be less white\" slides were included in Coca-Cola's mandatory diversity training for employees.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of the Coca-Cola logo in the screenshots proves that the training was required for Coca-Cola employees, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the screenshots and their connection to Coca-Cola's training, which have not been fully explored or confirmed.", "Contradict fact": "While the screenshots and the course featuring Robin DiAngelo are authentic, Coca-Cola has explicitly denied that the \"try to be less white\" slides were part of their mandatory diversity training, contradicting the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the slides and their inclusion in Coca-Cola's training, as it is not yet confirmed whether they were actually part of the curriculum.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any biases."}
