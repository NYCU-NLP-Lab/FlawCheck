{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the potential consequences of delaying the election by suggesting that Nancy Pelosi would automatically assume the role of acting president.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the unlikelihood of the 2020 general election being delayed, as it is stated that it is very unlikely and would require action by Congress rather than the president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide evidence or specific reasoning for why Nancy Pelosi would automatically assume the role of acting president in the absence of a president-elect.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that delaying the election would lead to Nancy Pelosi assuming the office of acting president, without considering other potential scenarios or constitutional provisions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or possibilities for what would happen if the election were delayed, such as the line of succession beyond Nancy Pelosi."}
