{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the current state of the race by stating that the latest polls show the candidates tied neck-and-neck, when in reality the poll mentioned was conducted in April 2017 and may not accurately reflect the current situation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it only references one poll conducted in April 2017, which may not be representative of the current state of the race. Additionally, the poll only surveyed 1,000 adults, which may not be a large enough sample size to draw definitive conclusions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the results of the April 2017 poll, which showed O'Rourke and Cruz tied at 30%, accurately represent the current state of the race. However, it is problematic to assume that the preferences of respondents from over a year ago still hold true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the results of the April 2017 poll, such as the fact that a significant percentage of respondents (37%) stated that they hadn't thought enough about the election or refused to reply.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing more recent and comprehensive polling data to support the assertion that O'Rourke and Cruz are tied neck-and-neck. Relying on a single poll from over a year ago may not accurately reflect the current dynamics of the race.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the financial advantage of Cruz, as it only mentions that O'Rourke raised more money in the second financial quarter of 2017, without providing further information on Cruz's overall campaign funds.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Cruz won the Senate seat in 2012 with 57% of the vote, suggesting that he is currently tied with O'Rourke. This contradiction undermines the claim's assertion of a neck-and-neck race."}
