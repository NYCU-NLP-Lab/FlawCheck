{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the health care law by stating that it \"adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people.\" The expert's verdict explains that this figure is based on a report commissioned by a Republican speaker and does not account for tax breaks and credits in the law.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that the health care law adds $800 billion in taxes. The expert's verdict also points out that the figure is based on an outdated report and does not account for tax credits.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the health care law does not discriminate between rich and poor. The expert's verdict does not address this assumption directly.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide any alternative explanations for the taxes imposed by the health care law. The expert's verdict does mention that there are differing opinions among experts on how to interpret the law's tax increases."}
