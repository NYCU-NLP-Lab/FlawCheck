{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific details or evidence to back up the statement that there have been six federal rulings finding intentional discrimination by the #Txlege since 2011.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of federal rulings finding intentional discrimination by the #Txlege since 2011 is a significant indicator of the extent of intentional discrimination. This assumption may be problematic as it does not account for the possibility of unreported or unresolved cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the federal rulings, such as differing interpretations of the law or political motivations of the judges involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been more than six federal rulings finding intentional discrimination by the #Txlege since 2011, as confirmed by PolitiFact Texas and the list provided by Jaclyn Uresti, executive director of MALC.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of federal rulings finding intentional discrimination by the #Txlege since 2011, as it only mentions six rulings and does not provide a comprehensive list.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it does not provide a clear and concise statement, making it difficult to interpret the exact meaning or intent behind the claim."}
