{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that oil prices never go down, when in fact there have been periods of decline in both gasoline and crude oil prices.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by making a broad statement that contradicts the long-term data on gasoline and crude oil prices.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it contradicts the data provided by the Energy Information Administration.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that oil prices never go down, which is contradicted by the evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation provided by Severin Borenstein, an economist, who states that while gasoline prices decline more slowly than they rise, it is not an iron rule but rather a pattern for short-term changes following a market shock."}
