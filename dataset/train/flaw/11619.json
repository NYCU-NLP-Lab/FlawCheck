{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to prove that Dis-Chem pharmacy mocked its rival over the racism row. The alleged ad has been shared on social media, but there is no concrete proof that it was created or published by Dis-Chem.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the alleged ad was a deliberate mocking response by Dis-Chem to the controversy surrounding Clicks Pharmacy. However, there is no clear evidence or statement from Dis-Chem confirming this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the alleged ad, such as a third party creating it to create further controversy or damage the reputation of Dis-Chem. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the true intentions behind the ad.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the denial statement from Dis-Chem, where they explicitly state that the ad was not published by them. This contradiction raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact and consequences of the alleged ad. It mentions that opinion was divided among those who found it insensitive and those who found it funny, but it does not provide further information on the potential harm caused or the public reaction.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting conflicting information. It mentions that the Dis-Chem logo used in the alleged ad is not high-resolution and not in line with the company's font or corporate identity. This suggests that the ad may be fake or unauthorized. However, it also mentions that the picture features Dis-Chem's logo in the top-left corner, which contradicts the previous statement.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the alleged ad by stating that Dis-Chem was mocking its rival over the racism row. Without concrete evidence or a clear statement from Dis-Chem, it is speculative to make such a claim."}
