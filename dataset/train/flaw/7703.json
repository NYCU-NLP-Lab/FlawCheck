{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of countries that have pre-booked the Bharat Biotech COVID vaccine Covaxin. It states that 190 countries have pre-booked the vaccine, which may be an exaggerated number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or sources to verify the statement that 190 countries have pre-booked the vaccine. The only source provided is a tweet by Rajat Sharma, which may not be sufficient to confirm the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the pre-booking of the vaccine by 190 countries is a sign of its effectiveness, affordability, and ease of storage. However, this assumption may not be accurate as pre-booking does not necessarily indicate these qualities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the pre-booking of the vaccine by 190 countries, such as geopolitical considerations, diplomatic relationships, or availability issues with other vaccines. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
