{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Patrick Murphy has taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress, except for the speaker and the majority leader. However, the expert's verdict reveals that Murphy's contributions from Wall Street actually rank No. 19 overall when senators are included.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that Murphy has taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress, except for the speaker and the majority leader.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that receiving a significant amount of money from Wall Street makes a candidate less progressive, without providing any explanation or evidence for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for Murphy's relatively high contributions from Wall Street, stating that senators typically receive more Wall Street money due to their impact on legislation and the need for more expensive campaigns."}
