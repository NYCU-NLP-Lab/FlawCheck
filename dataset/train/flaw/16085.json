{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that President Biden signed an executive order giving China access to or control over the U.S. power grid system, when in reality, he signed an executive order suspending a previous order by his predecessor for evaluation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to back up the assertion that China caused the Texas power outage in February 2021.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Biden's executive order would directly lead to China controlling the U.S. power grid, which is a problematic assumption as it oversimplifies the situation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that President Biden's executive order was aimed at evaluating the previous order by Donald Trump and did not grant China access to the U.S. power grid."}
