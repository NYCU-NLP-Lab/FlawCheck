{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Every Student Succeeds Act on Common Core by stating that it \"did away basically with Common Core,\" when in fact the law allows states to withdraw from Common Core but still accept it as an acceptable standard.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Every Student Succeeds Act completely eliminates Common Core, without acknowledging that states had the freedom to adopt or withdraw from Common Core even before the law was enacted.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the Every Student Succeeds Act eliminated Common Core. The provided information only mentions that the law allows states to withdraw from Common Core, but it does not provide any data on how many states actually did so.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim could be that the Every Student Succeeds Act gives states more flexibility in choosing their own education standards, including the option to withdraw from Common Core if they wish, but it does not necessarily eliminate Common Core altogether."}
