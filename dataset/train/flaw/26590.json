{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that a Kashmiri girl became blind after being hit by a pellet gun and her family members were killed and raped by the Indian Army.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the allegations made against the Indian Army.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image shared by the Pakistani handle is part of Pakistani propaganda and that there is an ISI hand behind it, without providing concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the handle @thezaiduleaks is a parody account and not run by Pakistanis or the ISI, as it claims to be for fun and 100% fake imaginary."}
