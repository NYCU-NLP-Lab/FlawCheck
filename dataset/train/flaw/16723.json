{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on an estimate provided by a news story and a court ruling, rather than concrete data or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 600,000 registered voters who lack the required photo ID are unable to legally turn out to vote, without considering alternative methods or provisions for voting without the specific ID.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why registered voters may not have the required photo ID, such as personal choice or preference.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the number of registered voters who lack the required photo ID, as it relies on a figure of 600,000, which is an estimate and may not capture the full extent of the issue.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim contradicts fact."}
