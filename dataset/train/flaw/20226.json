{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Jack Johnson invented and patented the first wrench, which is an exaggeration as the first-ever wrench was patented in 1835, while Johnson got a patent for a type of wrench in 1922.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the monkey wrench was patented around 1858, about 20 years before Johnson was born.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that white people insulted Jack Johnson by calling his invention the \"monkey wrench,\" without providing sufficient evidence or support for this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that white people insulted Jack Johnson by calling his invention the \"monkey wrench.\" No specific evidence or sources are provided to back up this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the origin of the term \"monkey wrench\" that are not mentioned in the claim."}
