{"Lack enough support": "The claim that \"Tourism forms 24% of Kenya's GDP\" lacks enough support because there is no tourism satellite account for Kenya, which is the international standard for measuring tourism's economic value. Accurate estimates are difficult to obtain.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that tourism forms 24% of Kenya's GDP without providing concrete evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Other data sources suggest that tourism makes a far smaller contribution to the Kenyan economy, between 0.7 and 0.8%. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that tourism forms 24% of Kenya's GDP.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the biggest contribution to Kenya's GDP in 2019 was by agriculture, which contributed 27.8% to GDP.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the contribution of other sectors such as agriculture, transport and storage, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing to Kenya's GDP. These sectors have been identified as key contributors, but the claim focuses solely on tourism.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it relies on incomplete data and lacks the comprehensive measure of tourism's economic value provided by a satellite account."}
