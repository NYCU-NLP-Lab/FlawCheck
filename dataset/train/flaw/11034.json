{"Exaggerate": "The ad uses powerful images of armed masked terrorists and makes claims about ISIS killing thousands and plotting attacks on U.S. soil, which may be an exaggeration of the actual threat.", "Contradict fact": "The ad misrepresents Kelli Ward's statements on fighting terrorism by using a partial quote that was directed at past presidents and not about fighting terrorists.", "Lack enough support": "The ad does not provide sufficient evidence or support for its claims that Kelli Ward would cut military funding and put the war on terror at risk.", "Problematic assumption": "The ad assumes that Kelli Ward's statements on restraint and realism in foreign policy automatically translate to being weak on national defense and fighting terrorists, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Falters at times": "The ad falters by misrepresenting Kelli Ward's stance on fighting terrorism and by using misleading visuals to create a negative perception.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The ad fails to consider alternative explanations for Kelli Ward's statements, such as a focus on strategic military actions rather than nation-building."}
