{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that St. Petersburg was the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007, without considering that not every utility in the state applied for the award.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that St. Petersburg was the best sewer system in the state, as it only mentions the award received from the Florida Water Environment Association.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being recognized for an award in 2007 automatically makes St. Petersburg the best maintained large sewer system in the state, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to mention the backstory and reasons why St. Petersburg was pouring resources into the sewers at the time, which could provide alternative explanations for the award."}
