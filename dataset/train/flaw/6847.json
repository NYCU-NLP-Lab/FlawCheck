{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient current data to support the assertion that domestic violence rates have dropped by 63 percent since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing up-to-date data on domestic violence rates, as the most recent data available is from 2012.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the drop in domestic violence rates is solely attributable to the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, without considering other potential factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the potential increase in intimate partner homicides since 2014, suggesting that the drop in domestic violence rates may not be consistent across all subsets of domestic violence."}
