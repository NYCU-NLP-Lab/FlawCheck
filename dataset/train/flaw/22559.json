{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Mike Pence has compromising ties to Russia. The information provided is based on rumors and internet posts, rather than concrete facts or credible sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Mike Pence's brother's position at Cummins Inc., a company that has business interests in Russia, automatically implies compromising ties to Russia. However, no direct evidence is presented to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the claim could be explained by a rumor that emerged in 2017, linking Mike Pence's brother's involvement with Cummins Inc. to questionable Russian ties. This indicates that there may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as political speculation or attempts to tarnish Pence's reputation.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that Cummins Inc. ceased making engines for use in Russian tanks in 2016 when the tank's main manufacturer decided to use Russian-made engines instead. This information undermines the claim's implication that Cummins Inc. is currently manufacturing engines for the Russian military.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Mike Pence has remained relatively unscathed by accusations of inappropriate Russian contacts, unlike some other members of the Trump administration and 2016 campaign staff. This suggests that the claim's assertion of compromising ties to Russia is in contrast to the available evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Mike Pence's brother's position at Cummins Inc. and the company's business interests in Russia. It implies that these factors automatically indicate compromising ties to Russia, without providing substantial evidence to support this exaggerated claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on internet rumors, posts, and speculation rather than verifiable facts or credible sources. This undermines the reliability and credibility of the claim."}
