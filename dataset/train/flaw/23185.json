{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Al Gore's prediction by stating that he said Earth's \"ice caps\" would melt away by 2014. In reality, Gore largely referenced Arctic sea ice in the summer and never referred to a year-long lack of ice for both poles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement about Al Gore's prediction.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Al Gore's prediction about the Arctic sea ice melting by 2014 was a definitive statement made by him, when in fact he attributed these predictions to scientists and selectively read aggressive estimates regarding future melting.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for why Al Gore made the statements about the possibility of a complete lack of summer sea ice in the Arctic by as early as 2013. It does not consider the context of climate change discussions at that time or the scientific research available."}
