{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm that students are being sexually abused in madrasas in India.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the videos shared on social media depict incidents of sexual abuse in madrasas, but this assumption is not explicitly supported or verified.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The videos could potentially have alternative explanations or contexts that are not explored or discussed in the provided information.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the incident shown in one of the videos actually took place in Pakistan, as per the information obtained from reverse image search and reports by Pakistani media.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and sensitivity of the issue of sexual abuse in educational institutions, as it relies solely on the videos shared on social media without providing comprehensive data or analysis."}
