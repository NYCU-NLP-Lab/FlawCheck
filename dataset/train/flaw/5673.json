{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"approximately 30 percent, or $2.7 billion a year, is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies\" may be an exaggeration as there is no definitive estimate available for the amount of wasteful spending in Virginia's Medicaid program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no specific data or evidence provided to back up the assertion that 30 percent of the Medicaid program's funds are wasted.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the national waste estimate of 30 percent, as mentioned in the Institute of Medicine's report, directly applies to Virginia's Medicaid program without further breakdown or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Virginia Secretary of Health Bill Hazel argues that the waste chart, which the claim is based on, has been taken out of context and does not directly apply to Medicaid. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the waste estimate.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the amount of waste, fraud, and inefficiencies in Virginia's Medicaid program as it relies on a national waste estimate without specifically addressing the state's situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by Virginia Secretary of Health Bill Hazel, who disagrees with the claim's interpretation of the waste chart and its direct application to Medicaid.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a presentation by Delegate Jimmie Massie, who may have a biased perspective due to his opposition to Medicaid expansion."}
