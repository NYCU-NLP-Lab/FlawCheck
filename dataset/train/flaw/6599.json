{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the financial incentives provided by Scott Walker's jobs agency lead to Wisconsin companies shipping jobs elsewhere. This could be an exaggeration as it assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the incentives and job relocation.", "Understate": "The claim states that a company received $4.6 million in taxpayer money and reduced its jobs by 300 people. This could be an understatement if there were more significant job losses or if other factors contributed to the reduction in jobs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that the financial incentives caused companies to ship jobs elsewhere. It lacks sufficient support to establish a causal link.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the incentives offered by Scott Walker's jobs agency are the sole or primary cause of companies shipping jobs elsewhere. It does not consider other factors that may influence a company's decision to relocate jobs.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for the reduction in jobs, such as changes in market conditions, technological advancements, or other economic factors. It solely attributes the job reduction to the financial incentives provided by the jobs agency."}
