{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of President Obama's actions on Medicare by stating that he has changed it \"for the worse.\" This is a subjective judgment and may not accurately reflect the overall impact of his policies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that President Obama created an \"unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage of certain treatments.\" Without sufficient evidence, the claim lacks enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the creation of the Independent Payments Advisory Board (IPAB) is inherently negative and will result in denying coverage of certain treatments. This assumption is not substantiated and may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the creation of IPAB, such as the need to address increasing costs of Medicare and the potential benefits of reducing wasteful spending."}
