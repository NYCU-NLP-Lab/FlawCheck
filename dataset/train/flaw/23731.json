{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the JNU students celebrated the death of 76 CRPF jawans. The provided evidence shows that the photograph in question was taken in 2016 and had nothing to do with the 2010 Dantewada massacre.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the alleged celebration by JNU students. The evidence suggests that the event organized by the 'Forum Against War on People' was opposing the killing of Maoists, rather than celebrating the massacre.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a misleading photograph and misinformation circulated by a Facebook page known for spreading false information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the photograph from 2016 shows JNU students celebrating the attack on CRPF jawans in 2010. This assumption is not supported by any factual evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the photograph captured JNU students celebrating the victory of CPI (ML)-affiliated student bodies in the 2016 JNU students' union elections, rather than celebrating the death of CRPF jawans.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading information and misinterpreting the context of the photograph."}
