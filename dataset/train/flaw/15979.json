However, the expert's verdict mentions that officials at the U.S. Treasury Department insist there will be no delays, suggesting that the assumption of potential delays may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decision to add President Trump's name to the stimulus checks.
