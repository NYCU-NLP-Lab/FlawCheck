{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Hillary Clinton's statement by misrepresenting her words as a demand for Christians to renounce their faith.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hillary Clinton's statement about changing cultural codes and religious beliefs refers specifically to Christians, which is a problematic assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Hillary Clinton explicitly stated that Christians in America must deny their faith in Christianity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that Hillary Clinton was discussing the need for cultural and religious changes to support gender equality, rather than targeting Christians specifically."}
