{"Understate": "The claim may understate the importance and involvement of Ronald Wayne as a co-founder of Apple. The expert's verdict mentions that Wayne's name and potential fortune have been lost in the mists of time, indicating that his contributions may have been downplayed or overlooked.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Ron Wayne was a third Apple co-founder. The expert's verdict mentions Wayne's involvement, but it does not provide concrete evidence or references to corroborate this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why Ron Wayne sold his 10% share in Apple. It presents the sale as a straightforward action without exploring other possible reasons or circumstances that may have influenced Wayne's decision.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a clear timeline or context for Ron Wayne's involvement and subsequent departure from Apple. The expert's verdict provides some additional information, but it does not fully clarify the sequence of events or the reasons behind Wayne's departure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ron Wayne's 10% share in Apple would have been worth billions of dollars if he had held onto it. This assumption may overlook factors such as dilution of shares, changes in company valuation, or other financial considerations that could have affected the value of Wayne's shares.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Ron Wayne's role as a co-founder by suggesting that his name and potential fortune have been lost in the mists of time. While Wayne's contributions may have been overshadowed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, it is unclear if his name and potential fortune have truly been forgotten by all people worldwide."}
