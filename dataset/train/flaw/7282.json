{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of tax cuts by stating that taxes were cut every year for a total of $19 billion, without providing enough evidence or context to support this figure.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that taxes were actually cut by $19 billion. The methodology used to calculate this figure is questionable and there is no clear breakdown of specific tax cuts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all revenue changes mentioned in the state's report are tax cuts, while in reality, they could include various legislative actions that are not necessarily tax cuts.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately attributing the tax cuts solely to Jeb Bush, as the revenue changes resulted from actions by the Legislature and not solely from his influence or line-item veto power.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the revenue changes, such as fee and license changes, sales tax holidays, and lottery proceeds, which may have contributed to the overall revenue changes but are not necessarily tax cuts."}
