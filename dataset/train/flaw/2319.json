{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the STI by stating that it makes the penis rot in three days and kills within the same period. This is not supported by evidence or expert testimony.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or expert testimony to confirm the existence of the STI named Jakadala.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported outbreak of Jakadala is true without providing sufficient evidence or expert verification.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no outbreak of a new STI in the western part of Kenya, as confirmed by Dr. Sammy Mahugu from the Ministry of Health.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents alternative explanations for the photos used to depict the alleged effects of Jakadala, suggesting that they are actually old images of untreated syphilis and penile cancer."}
