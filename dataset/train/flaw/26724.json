{"Understate": "The claim may understate the requirements for sex education in Texas schools. The expert's verdict provides evidence that schools are required to establish a local school health advisory council and make recommendations on the health curriculum, including human sexuality education.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of a requirement means that sex education is not taught in Texas schools. However, the expert's verdict highlights that while it may not be mandated, there are guidelines and curriculum standards in place that require the teaching of sex education at appropriate grade levels.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that while sex education is not mandated in Texas schools, it is still taught based on curriculum standards and guidelines set by the state board of education."}
