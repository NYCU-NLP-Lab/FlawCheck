{"Understate": "The claim may understate the gender pay gap by stating that women are paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid. The expert's verdict mentions that women of color earn even less, suggesting that the pay gap could be even wider for certain demographics.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that $11,000 per year is lost simply because a woman isn't a man. It is not clear how this figure is calculated or what factors contribute to it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the gender pay gap is solely due to discrimination, without considering other factors such as career choices, education, experience, and job preferences that may contribute to the gap.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions other factors that can contribute to the gender pay gap, such as the degrees and jobs women pursue, time taken off for caregiving, and the number of hours worked. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the pay gap beyond discrimination alone."}
