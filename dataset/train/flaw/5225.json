{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of harm experienced by patients in hospitals. While the claim states that \"one of three patients hospitalized (is) harmed by the care they receive,\" it is unclear if this statistic accurately represents the overall frequency of harm.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient supporting evidence to back up the statistic provided. Although the claim references a study in the journal Health Affairs, it does not provide specific details or additional research to confirm the accuracy of the statistic.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all harm experienced by patients in hospitals is directly caused by the care they receive. It does not consider other factors that could contribute to patient harm, such as underlying health conditions or external circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for patient harm, such as the complexity of medical procedures, the inherent risks of certain treatments, or the variability in patient conditions.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of information. While it highlights the seriousness of patient harm, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue or consider opposing viewpoints.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the frequency of patient harm by only focusing on hospital admissions. It does not take into account harm that may occur in other healthcare settings or after patients are discharged from the hospital.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim, as it is based on a statistic from a study. However, the accuracy of the statistic itself may be questionable."}
