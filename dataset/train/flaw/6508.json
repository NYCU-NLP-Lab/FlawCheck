{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the hospital design by stating that it will be \"AIIMS-like\" and provide \"free medical facilities\". It is unclear if these claims are supported by evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that a hospital will be built by the Muslim body in Ayodhya. It only mentions a Facebook post and a statement from the Sunni Waqf Board.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the design for the hospital is genuine and accurately represents the plans of the Muslim body. However, the image used in the claim is actually a design of the University of Virginia's medical center, raising doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the image, such as the possibility of it being a misrepresentation or a misunderstanding. The use of a different building design in the image raises questions about its authenticity and purpose.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image used is not actually a design for the Babri hospital but a design of the University of Virginia's medical center. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by using an inaccurate image to support its assertion about the design of the Babri hospital. This raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the information presented."}
