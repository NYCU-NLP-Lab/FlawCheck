{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the response of the crowd by stating that they responded in \"one voice\" and that even when the question was repeated, the crowd still responded with \"Kamal Nath.\" The video does not provide evidence of the entire crowd unanimously responding in this way.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a short video clip without any additional context or evidence to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the crowd's response accurately reflects the opinion of the entire population or that it represents a significant portion of the population. However, the video does not provide any information about the size or representativeness of the crowd.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the crowd's response, such as political affiliation, local context, or other factors that influenced their answer. The claim does not consider or explore these alternative explanations."}
