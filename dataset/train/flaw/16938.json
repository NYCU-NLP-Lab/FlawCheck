{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of speed as a contributing factor to increasing vehicular fatalities. The expert mentions that there is no \"incontrovertible proof\" but does not rule out the possibility that speed can still be a factor.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support its assertion that speed, in and of itself, is not a contributing factor to increasing fatalities. The expert's statement does not provide concrete evidence to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that speed alone is not a contributing factor to increasing vehicular fatalities. This assumption may overlook the potential role of speed in accidents.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert acknowledges that while speed is a problem, it is not usually the only problem in fatal accidents. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to the increase in fatalities.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's statement contradicts the fact that there is a correlation between speed and accidents. While the expert acknowledges the correlation, they question whether speed is the real cause of accidents.", "Falters at times": "The expert's statement seems to falter at times, as they mention the correlation between speed and accidents but also question whether speed is the real cause. This inconsistency may introduce bias in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's statement."}
