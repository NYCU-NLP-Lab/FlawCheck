The expert's verdict provides information about Warren's statements and actions regarding her Native American ancestry but does not specifically address the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not present any alternative explanations or perspectives regarding Elizabeth Warren's listing of her race as \"American Indian\" on her 1986 Texas State Bar registration card.
