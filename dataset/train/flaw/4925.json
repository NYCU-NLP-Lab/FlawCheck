{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the lead that Fox News has over CNN and MSNBC in television viewership. While it is true that Fox News had higher viewership numbers than the other two networks at the time of the report, the claim does not provide specific data on the extent of the lead.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the decline in viewership for CNN and MSNBC after the 2016 election. The expert's verdict mentions that both networks saw their ratings dip, and the losses for CNN and MSNBC were proportionally larger than that of Fox News. However, the claim does not provide this information and instead focuses on Fox News' increased lead.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that Fox News has increased its lead over CNN and MSNBC since the 2016 election. The expert's verdict mentions that Fox News' overall viewership grew, but it does not provide specific data on the extent of the lead or how it has changed over time.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decline in viewership for CNN and MSNBC is primarily due to Trump supporters boycotting those news outlets. However, the expert's verdict states that attributing the decline solely to this boycott is a matter of assumption or speculation rather than hard data.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the decline in viewership for CNN and MSNBC after the 2016 election was largely expected, as all three networks saw major viewership gains during the election. This alternative explanation is not mentioned in the claim, which implies that Fox News' increased lead is solely due to the boycott by Trump supporters."}
