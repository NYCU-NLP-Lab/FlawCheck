{"Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of reducing state spending growth, as it compares two-year increments to one-year increments, making the difference seem more dramatic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully evaluate the extent of the reduction in state spending growth, as it only provides average percentages without further context or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reduction in state spending growth was solely due to the actions of Tim Pawlenty as governor, without considering other factors or external influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in state spending growth, such as the use of one-time fixes or structural imbalances, which were raised by critics of Pawlenty's approach.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in terms of providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of reducing state spending growth, as it only focuses on certain time periods and does not consider the long-term effects."}
