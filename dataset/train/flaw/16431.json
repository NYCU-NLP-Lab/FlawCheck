{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible information provided to substantiate the assertion that the Obama Foundation tweeted about George Floyd on May 17, 2020, eight days before his death.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the tweet from the Obama Foundation featuring the image of George Floyd was intentionally planned in advance, suggesting a conspiracy. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image of George Floyd was not taken until May 30, 2020, and was first used on the Obama Foundation's site on May 31, 2020. Therefore, the claim's assertion that the tweet with the image was posted on May 17 is false.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that the image of George Floyd was not originally featured in the May 16 or May 17 tweet from the Obama Foundation. The image was added later and updated dynamically based on the information set.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting misleading articles and false claims that suggest a planned event surrounding George Floyd's death. These articles and claims have been debunked, undermining the credibility of the initial claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the presence of the image of George Floyd in the tweet from the Obama Foundation. It is explained that websites can choose a preview image (Twitter card) that changes when the site updates the card. Therefore, the presence of the image in the tweet does not necessarily indicate pre-planning."}
