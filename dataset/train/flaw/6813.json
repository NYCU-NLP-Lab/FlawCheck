{"Exaggerate": "The claim of a \"500 percent more traffic\" may be an exaggeration as it is based on a projection made by a city planner and may not accurately reflect the actual increase in traffic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it is based on yard signs without any identified origin or sponsor.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the proposed redevelopment will result in a quintupling of area traffic without providing concrete evidence or analysis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the potential increase in traffic, such as changes in transportation patterns or population growth, which are not mentioned or considered in the claim."}
