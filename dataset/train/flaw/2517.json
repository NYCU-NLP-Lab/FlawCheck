The expert's verdict explains that the wording on WhiteHouse.org is a summary and not a reproduction of the Bill of Rights.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the use of the word \"citizens\" instead of \"persons\" on WhiteHouse.org is not a creation of the Trump administration but has been used since at least the Obama administration."}
