{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that Arvind Kejriwal is drunk based on the video.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that Arvind Kejriwal is actually drunk.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that slurred speech in the video automatically means that Kejriwal is drunk, without considering other possible explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Kejriwal's slurred speech in the video, such as fatigue or a medical condition, which are not considered in the claim."}
