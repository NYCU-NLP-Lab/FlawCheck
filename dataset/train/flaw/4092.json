{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides a Facebook post and a screenshot of tweets as evidence for the increase in petrol and diesel prices. There is no additional data or official sources cited to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in petrol and diesel prices is a decision made by the Pakistan government. However, the Prime Minister's advisor, Shahbaz Gill, tweeted that the government did not increase the prices despite a recommendation by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA). This suggests that there may be alternative factors or entities involved in the decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The tweet by Shahbaz Gill and the screenshot of the OGRA recommendation provide an alternative explanation to the claim. It suggests that the government did not approve the recommended increase in petroleum product prices and that no increase was made. This contradicts the claim that the Pakistan government increased the prices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact presented in the tweet by Shahbaz Gill and the screenshot of the OGRA recommendation, which state that the government did not increase the prices of petroleum products.", "Exaggerate": "It is unclear whether the claim exaggerates the increase in petrol and diesel prices, as the exact amount of increase is not mentioned. However, the fact that the claim is based on a Facebook post and a screenshot of tweets without additional evidence raises questions about the accuracy and potential exaggeration of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates the increase in petrol and diesel prices.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times. However, the lack of additional supporting evidence and the contradictory information provided by Shahbaz Gill's tweet and the OGRA recommendation raise doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the claim."}
