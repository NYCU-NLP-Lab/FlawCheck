{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the education committee's involvement in deciding what's in local salad bars. The committee's role is limited to providing flexibility for free-meal schools to set up and run salad bars.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to prove that the education committee is deciding what's in local salad bars. The evidence provided only shows that the committee is proposing regulations to give flexibility to free-meal schools regarding salad bars.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the education committee's actions regarding salad bars extend beyond schools to all local salad bars, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the education committee's actions are focused on providing flexibility for free-meal schools in setting up and running salad bars, rather than making decisions for all local salad bars."}
