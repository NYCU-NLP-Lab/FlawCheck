{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Knopp upheld a campaign promise not to join the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), when in fact he was a member of PERS from 1999 to 2005.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Knopp's previous membership in PERS is not relevant, when it could be seen as important information for evaluating his stance on the system.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that Knopp upheld a campaign promise, as it does not provide evidence or documentation of the promise.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Knopp was a member of PERS from 1999 to 2005, which goes against his statement of not joining the system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for Knopp's decision to not join PERS, which is his cashing out of his account in 2010 due to a family medical emergency."}
