{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Missouri employers will gain the right to fire people who use birth control is incorrect.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Missouri Senate Bill 5 by stating that it would allow employers to fire workers for using birth control, when there is no evidence to support this.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence to back up the assertion that employers will be able to fire people for using birth control.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the bill will overturn the St. Louis ordinance that prohibits discrimination based on reproductive health care decisions, but it remains to be seen if this will actually happen.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The interpretation that the bill would allow employers to fire people for using birth control was a result of the rhetoric of Republicans, according to the executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri."}
