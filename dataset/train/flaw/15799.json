{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican lacks sufficient evidence to support it. The expert's verdict mentions that there are claims from conservative groups and statements from Alveda C. King, the civil rights leader's niece, but these claims are dismissed by other members of King's family.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Martin Luther King Jr.'s party affiliation was Republican based on the assumption that most blacks were Republicans before the election of Democrat John F. Kennedy as president in 1960. However, this assumption is not supported by concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for Martin Luther King Jr.'s party affiliation, including claims that his party affiliation was unknown and statements from family members who deny that he was a Republican."}
