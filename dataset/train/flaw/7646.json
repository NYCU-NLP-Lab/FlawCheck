{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of people killed by tainted food in the United States compared to the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between deaths caused by tainted food and deaths of U.S. troops.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that passing laws ensuring food inspections would prevent deaths caused by tainted food, without providing enough evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the difference in the number of deaths, such as differences in population size, combat situations, and other factors that make a direct comparison problematic."}
