{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that the Amish don't get autism solely because they do not vaccinate their children, ignoring other factors that may contribute to the low rates of autism among the Amish.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a non-scientific survey conducted by a reporter, which is controversial and not a reliable source of evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the Amish do not vaccinate their children, which is false according to a study that found a majority of Amish parents do vaccinate their children to some degree.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the lower rates of autism among the Amish, such as differences in lifestyle, genetics, or other environmental factors."}
