{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the support received by the Paradise Adventist Academy.

It assumes that the support was solely due to the opponents' compassion for the fire victims, but there could be other factors or motivations at play.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of any contradiction of facts in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times in the provided information."}
