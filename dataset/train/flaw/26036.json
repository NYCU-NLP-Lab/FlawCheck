{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Cuomo's policy by stating that it \"planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers.\" The expert's verdict mentions that while the policy had an effect on the spread of the coronavirus, it was not solely responsible for the deaths.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of Cuomo's policy by not acknowledging the potential undercounting of deaths in nursing homes. The expert's verdict mentions that the death count may be 50% higher than what Cuomo's administration provided.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Cuomo's policy \"forced\" nursing homes to take in COVID positive patients. The expert's verdict mentions that the policy directed nursing homes to accept such patients but did not force them.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Cuomo's policy directly caused the deaths of thousands of nursing home residents. The expert's verdict states that while the policy had an effect on the spread of the virus, it was not solely responsible for the deaths.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the deaths of nursing home residents, such as other factors contributing to the spread of the virus. The expert's verdict mentions that the introduction of COVID positive patients into nursing homes had an effect on the spread, but it was not solely responsible."}
