{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it suggests that Wisconsin clerks may have illegally filled in witness addresses on ballots, implying a potential violation of state law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that illegal actions took place. The expert's verdict provides statements from the Wisconsin Elections Commission and its public information officer, who refute the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the directive issued by the state Elections Commission in October 2020 allowed clerks to \"fix\" ballots, which is presented as potentially violating state law. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the addresses were added in accordance with the Commission's guidance and have been in effect for several elections.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the addresses were added as part of a publicly observable process and under Commission guidance. It also mentions that the motion to approve the guidance was made by Republican members of the Commission and has been in effect for multiple elections without objections.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no corrections were made to the ballots, but rather witness addresses were added in accordance with the Commission's guidance. This is confirmed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission's public information officer.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting a potentially misleading interpretation of the Wisconsin Statute and the Commission's directive. The expert's verdict clarifies that the statute does not specify who affixes the witness address and that the directive allows clerks to use reliable information to resolve missing address information.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
