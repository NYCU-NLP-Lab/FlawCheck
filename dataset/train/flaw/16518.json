{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Jasper County raised property taxes by 7 percent specifically to pay for one death penalty case. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the county had to raise property taxes to cover the costs of three Byrd-related prosecutions and legal appeals, not just one case.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or sources to back up the statement that property taxes were raised solely for the purpose of one death penalty case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 7 percent increase in property taxes was solely due to the cost of one death penalty case, without considering other factors or expenses that may have contributed to the tax increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the tax increase, such as the costs of multiple prosecutions and legal appeals, as well as the strain on the county's budget due to the expenses associated with death penalty cases in general."}
