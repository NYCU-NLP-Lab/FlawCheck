{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the actions of President Obama and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by stating that they \"sued\" Boeing over its decision to open a plant in South Carolina. The expert's verdict explains that the NLRB initiated a hearing process against Boeing based on allegations of retaliation, but the issue was resolved through negotiations and the complaint was dropped.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the NLRB's actions were solely directed by President Obama. While the NLRB is appointed by the president, it operates as an independent agency and its decisions are not solely determined by the president.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or details to support the assertion that President Obama and the NLRB specifically targeted Boeing for opening a plant in South Carolina. The expert's verdict explains the context of the NLRB-Boeing conflict, but it does not directly address the claim's assertion.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the NLRB's actions, stating that the complaint was based on allegations of retaliation by Boeing against the union. This implies that the NLRB's actions were not solely motivated by targeting Boeing for opening a plant in South Carolina.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the sequence of events and the nature of the NLRB's actions. The expert's verdict provides a more nuanced explanation of the NLRB-Boeing conflict, highlighting the negotiations and resolution of the issue, which contradicts the claim's assertion of a lawsuit against Boeing."}
