{"Understate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Donald Trump's order by stating it was \"unprecedented,\" while the expert's verdict clarifies that the resignation of politically appointed ambassadors at the start of a new administration is commonplace.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or support to prove that Donald Trump's order was truly unprecedented. The expert's verdict provides evidence that other presidents have made exceptions on a case-by-case basis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for Donald Trump's order, stating that he took a hard line against leaving any of President Obama's political appointees in place as he prepared to take office.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that exceptions have been made by other presidents on a case-by-case basis, as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Donald Trump's order is unusual or unprecedented without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption."}
