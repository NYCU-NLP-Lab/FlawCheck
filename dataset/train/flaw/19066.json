{"Exaggerate\n2": "Falters at times", "Lack enough support\n4": "Problematic assumption", "Exist alternative explanation\n\nExplanation": "1. Exaggerate: The claim exaggerates by stating that Ken Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman's health. This is an exaggeration because Cuccinelli has consistently supported allowing abortion when a mother's life is endangered by pregnancy.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing enough evidence to support the statement that Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal. The evidence provided only shows his support for personhood bills, but it does not prove that he opposes abortion in every circumstance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal. The evidence provided only shows his support for personhood bills and his stance on allowing abortion when a mother's life is endangered, but it does not provide sufficient evidence for the blanket claim made in the ad.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that Cuccinelli's support for personhood bills means he wants to make all abortion illegal. This assumption is problematic because it does not take into account his stance on allowing abortion in certain circumstances.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for Cuccinelli's position on abortion. While he is an opponent of abortion, he has consistently supported allowing abortion when a mother's life is endangered by pregnancy. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that he wants to make all abortion illegal."}
