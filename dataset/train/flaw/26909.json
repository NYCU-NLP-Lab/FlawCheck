{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a baby is a leading cause of poverty spells in the United States without considering other factors that may contribute to poverty.", "Lack enough support": "The claim relies on a tweet from an advocacy group and a 2012 article that links the birth of a child to poverty spells, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that while the birth of a child may contribute to poverty spells, there are other events such as loss of work hours that have a larger impact on poverty.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of other factors such as loss of work hours by focusing solely on the birth of a child as a leading cause of poverty.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's analysis contradicts the claim by stating that pregnancy is not the leading cause of poverty.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not considering the limitations of the data and the possibility that events are not mutually exclusive, as pointed out by the expert."}
