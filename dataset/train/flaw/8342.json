{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Alex Jones' statement by stating that he said \"the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there.\" This is because Jones himself denies making such a statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any direct evidence or sources to back up the statement that Alex Jones made this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Alex Jones made the statement about the Sandy Hook massacre victims being child actors without providing concrete evidence or sources to support this assumption."}
