{"Exaggerate": "The claim made by Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli that Virginia has never gone a year without passing a budget is an exaggeration. There has been at least one instance where the General Assembly could not agree on a budget, leading to a stalemate.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because there was a specific instance in 2001 where the General Assembly could not agree on a budget, contradicting Cuccinelli's statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove its validity. While Virginia generally follows a two-year budget cycle, there was a specific instance where a budget agreement could not be reached.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Virginia's budgetary process is flawless and superior to that of Congress. However, the existence of a budget impasse in 2001 suggests that there can be challenges and disagreements in passing a budget in Virginia as well.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation to the claim is that passing a budget in Virginia may be easier due to the state's smaller size and more homogeneous political landscape compared to the complexities and divisions present in Congress."}
