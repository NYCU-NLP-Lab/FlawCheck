{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of Muslims protesting against the Islamic State by stating that millions of Muslims protested, whereas the expert's verdict clarifies that it was a mass pilgrimage for Arbaeen.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion of a \"media blackout\" preventing coverage of the event.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the event was a protest against the Islamic State, but the expert's verdict clarifies that it was a religious pilgrimage and not specifically a political protest.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the pilgrimage has taken on a defiant tone as attacks from the Islamic State have plagued the area, suggesting that the event serves as a show of resilience against the terrorist group."}
