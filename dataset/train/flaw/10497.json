{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because while the claim states that Senators Murkowski and Begich \"vote as much as 80 percent of the time together,\" Murkowski disagrees with this statement and emphasizes their differences on national matters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it only provides data for the first six months of 2014, which is a limited timeframe and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of their voting records.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that voting together a high percentage of the time is \"healthy for Alaska\" without providing evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as Murkowski and Begich have served together since 2009, and their voting records show that they have voted together only 60 percent of the time during that period, which contradicts the claim's assertion of 80 percent agreement.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of disagreement between Murkowski and Begich by only focusing on procedural votes and not mentioning the significant disagreements on judges' and administrators' confirmations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Murkowski has publicly expressed her hope for Begich to lose his seat to a Republican challenger, indicating a lack of agreement and teamwork between the senators.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the level of agreement between Murkowski and Begich by stating that they vote together as much as 80 percent of the time without considering their overall voting history and the differences in their positions on national matters."}
