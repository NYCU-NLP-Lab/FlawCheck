{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the issue of criminals being released after being caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally. The expert's verdict states that the U.S. is required to detain certain criminals and they are subject to deportation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific examples to back up the assertion that criminals caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally are released.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all criminals caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally are released, which is not accurate. The expert's verdict clarifies that certain criminals are required to be detained and can be subject to deportation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the U.S. is required to detain certain criminals. The expert's verdict states that the U.S. is indeed required to detain certain criminals and they are subject to deportation.", "Understate": "The claim understates the process and requirements for seeking asylum in the U.S. It fails to mention that individuals apprehended near the border who have passed the initial \"credible fear\" threshold must still have a formal asylum hearing, which can take years.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide an alternative explanation or acknowledge that there are specific criteria and circumstances under which individuals may be released pending a long-term removal proceeding.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately portraying the obligations and procedures related to detaining criminals and releasing individuals caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate and nuanced explanation of the process."}
