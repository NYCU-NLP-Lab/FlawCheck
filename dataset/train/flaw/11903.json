{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that flu deaths have sharply decreased and may be misreported, which may be an exaggeration without sufficient evidence.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide substantial evidence or data to support the assertion that flu deaths are being misreported.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in flu deaths is due to misreporting, without considering other potential factors such as preventive measures or changes in behavior.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decrease in flu deaths, such as increased vaccination rates or improved healthcare practices.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact-checking done by USA TODAY and the CDC, which have both reported that flu deaths have not been misreported and that COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and well-supported argument, making it less reliable.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of COVID-19 compared to the flu by suggesting that flu deaths are being misreported, while the evidence suggests otherwise."}
