{"Understate": "The claim states that all County Governments allocated at least 20% to health, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that the average allocation to the agriculture sector was only 6.7%. This suggests that the claim may be understating the actual allocation to health.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict provides information about the allocation to the agriculture sector and the increase in functional health facilities, but it does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that all County Governments allocated at least 20% to health. This suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all County Governments allocated at least 20% to health without providing evidence or data to support this assumption. The expert's verdict provides evidence of the allocation to the agriculture sector, but it does not directly address the claim about health allocation. This suggests that the claim may be based on a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides information about the allocation to the agriculture sector and the increase in functional health facilities, but it does not provide an alternative explanation for the claim that all County Governments allocated at least 20% to health. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim that have not been addressed."}
