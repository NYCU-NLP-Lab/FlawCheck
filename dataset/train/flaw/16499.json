{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the swimming abilities of tarantulas by stating that they can \"row across water\" with their legs acting as paddles.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the fact that tarantulas are not particularly adept at water travel and swimming is typically a matter of survival for them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully prove that tarantulas are skilled swimmers, as it only provides one video as evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tarantula in the video is swimming willingly and not accidentally falling into the water.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that other types of spiders, such as the diving bell spider and dolomedes briangreenei, are more comfortable in aquatic environments and have better swimming abilities than tarantulas."}
