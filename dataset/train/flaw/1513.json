{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the number of times Kelly Ayotte voted against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act. The expert's verdict mentions that Ayotte has sponsored and promoted her own bill called the GAP Act, which supports equal pay. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerating Ayotte's opposition to equal pay legislation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement that Kelly Ayotte voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act. Without additional information or references, the claim lacks sufficient support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act automatically means opposition to equal pay for women. However, the expert's verdict mentions that Ayotte has her own bill, the GAP Act, which aims to achieve equal pay while preserving merit pay and flexible schedules. The claim does not consider this alternative approach to addressing the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that Ayotte's opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act is based on concerns about potential frivolous lawsuits and problematic litigation, as well as the belief that it could restrict merit pay. The claim does not acknowledge these alternative explanations for Ayotte's voting decisions."}
