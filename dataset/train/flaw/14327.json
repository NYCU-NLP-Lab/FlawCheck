{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the severity of the flooding at Hyderabad airport by using the term \"flooding\" without specifying the extent or impact of the flooding.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to establish the extent or severity of the flooding at Hyderabad airport.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is indeed showing flooding at Hyderabad airport without providing concrete evidence or verification.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The video could potentially be showing a different airport or a different location altogether, as evidenced by the similar video from Mexico City International Airport in 2017."}
