{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Kamala Harris donated money to a Minnesota nonprofit that helped protesters who were arrested get out of jail and break more laws.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Harris's support for the Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF) automatically translates into donating money to the organization and supporting the release of individuals who would go on to commit more crimes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no evidence to show that people who received bail or bond assistance from MFF for arrests during the protests committed more crimes after their release.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Harris's support for MFF by suggesting that it resulted in protesters breaking more laws.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Harris expressed support for MFF and encouraged her supporters to donate to it, but did not personally donate money to the organization."}
