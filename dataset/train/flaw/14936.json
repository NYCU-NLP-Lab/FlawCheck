{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating because it states that the investigation \"confirmed\" the person's absence from the racist photo, implying a high level of certainty.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or details about the investigation that confirmed the person's absence from the photo.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the investigation was conducted thoroughly and objectively, without considering any potential biases or flaws in the process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for the person's absence from the photo, such as the photo being doctored or manipulated.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times because it relies on the statements and explanations given by the person involved, without critically examining or questioning their credibility.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the person initially apologized for appearing in a racist photo and later recanted their statement, raising doubts about their credibility.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the controversy and impact of the racist photo, as it focuses solely on the person's absence from the photo rather than addressing the broader issue of racism and its implications."}
