{"Understate": "The claim may understate the increase in deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by only stating a 70 percent increase, while the evidence provided suggests a larger increase of 71 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides data for a specific time period (2008-2010) and the first half of 2011. It would be more comprehensive if data from additional years or a longer time period were included.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in deportation of criminals under the Obama administration is a significant shift in policy, without providing further evidence or context to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in deportation of criminals, such as changes in immigration enforcement policies or shifts in priorities within the Department of Homeland Security."}
