{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the fact that an exorcism took place in the house after Hurricane Ike in 1988. The expert's verdict confirms that this is completely false and that the house was actually built after 2005.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the house in the photo was built after 2005, not in 1988 as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that an exorcism took place in the house.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the house in the photo is the same house where the exorcism allegedly took place, which is a problematic assumption since the house was built after the claimed event.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation, stating that the house was built in 2005 after Hurricane Rita destroyed the previous home on the same lot."}
