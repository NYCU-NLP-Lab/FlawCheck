{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that HEBs and Brookshires in Texas are calibrating their own gas pumps because the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) sends them the stickers. However, the campaign manager of Hank Gilbert, the Democratic nominee, clarified that Gilbert misspoke and that TDA does not send out those stickers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of gas-pump inspectors in the field leads to HEBs and Brookshires calibrating their own gas pumps. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence or further explanation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that HEBs and Brookshires in Texas are actually calibrating their own gas pumps. The campaign manager's clarification suggests that Gilbert's statement was incorrect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why HEBs and Brookshires may have independent inspector stickers on their pumps. The campaign manager's explanation suggests that these stickers are not the same as state inspection seals and are obtained independently."}
