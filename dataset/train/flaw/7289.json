{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of new Texas teachers without college degrees, as the actual percentage is much lower than 50%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of college degrees among new Texas teachers is a problem that needs to be fixed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that 50% of new Texas teachers lack college degrees.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternate claim suggests that the statement made by the candidate was intended to emphasize the rarity of newly certified teachers with bachelor's degrees in education, rather than the absence of college degrees among new teachers."}
