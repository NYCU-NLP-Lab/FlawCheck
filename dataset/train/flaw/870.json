{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the leaders of the Indian communist party raised pro-China posters after the June 2020 border clash. The provided evidence includes doctored images and a Facebook post, but it does not provide concrete proof of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the leaders of the Indian communist party raised pro-China posters based on the doctored images and the caption of the Facebook post. However, this assumption may not be accurate or supported by factual evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images were doctored to digitally insert the anti-India, pro-China placards. The original photos published on Twitter by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) show the leaders protesting against domestic policies of the ruling government, not supporting China.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the involvement and support of the leaders of the Indian communist party for China based on the doctored images. The original photos show their participation in a protest against the Indian government's policies, not explicit support for China.", "Understate": "It is unclear if there is any understatement bias in the claim, as the evidence provided does not strongly support or understate any specific aspect of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the doctored images were created to falsely accuse the leaders of the Indian communist party of supporting China, with the intention of discrediting them or creating controversy."}
