{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of children who can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition by using the higher end of the range (17 million) instead of the more accurate range of 4 to 17 million.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the claim that 17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new health care law is solely responsible for the change in denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, without considering other factors that may have contributed to this change.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the decrease in denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions, such as changes in insurance company policies or market trends, which are not addressed in the claim."}
