{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which government workers are better paid than taxpayers who support them. The expert's verdict mentions that government workers in 41 states earned higher average pay and benefits than private workers, but it also provides examples where this is not the case, such as in Texas.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the potential factors or alternative explanations for the disparity in pay between government workers and taxpayers. The expert's verdict mentions that the private-sector workforce includes a broader range of jobs, while federal civilian jobs focus on professional areas that require higher education. This suggests that the type of jobs and qualifications required may contribute to the pay difference.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that government workers are better paid than taxpayers who support them. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on figures obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and a news article, but it also provides counterexamples and alternative data points.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that government workers are not also taxpayers. The expert's verdict points out that government workers are also taxpayers, suggesting that the claim overlooks this fact.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not consider alternative explanations for the pay disparity between government workers and taxpayers. The expert's verdict mentions that the type of jobs and qualifications required in the public and private sectors may contribute to the difference in pay, indicating that there are alternative factors at play."}
