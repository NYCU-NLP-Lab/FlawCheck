{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the level of opposition to the government takeover of health care by stating that a majority of Wisconsinites opposed it, when the poll results show that opponents only slightly outnumbered supporters.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to conclusively prove that a majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care, as the poll results show a margin of error and there are other polls with different results.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Russ Feingold's vote for the health care changes goes against the will of the people, without considering other factors or motivations behind his decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Russ Feingold's vote, such as his own beliefs or the potential benefits he saw in the health care changes.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on one poll conducted by a conservative think tank, without considering other polls or the potential bias of the source.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the level of support for repealing the health care law, as one of the polls mentioned shows 58 percent of likely state voters in favor of repeal.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Russ Feingold claims to listen to the pulse of Wisconsin residents, suggesting that he ignored public opinion by voting for the health care changes."}
