{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of tax cuts on the number and amount of bonuses received by workers. While it is true that millions of workers have received bonuses, the claim does not provide specific evidence to support the claim that \"many of them\" received \"thousands and thousands of dollars.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that over 3 million workers have received tax cut bonuses. While Americans for Tax Reform compiled a list of announced bonuses, it is not clear if this represents all bonuses given as a result of the tax bill.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the tax cuts are the sole cause of the bonuses received by workers. It does not consider other factors that may have influenced companies' decisions to provide bonuses, such as market conditions or company-specific considerations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the bonuses received by workers, such as companies' efforts to attract and retain top talent in a tight labor market.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in its presentation of the data. While it states that \"at least 286 companies have announced wage and salary increases, bonuses, or 401(k) match increases,\" it does not provide a clear timeframe for these announcements or compare them to previous years.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of bonuses on a small percentage of American workers. While the claim acknowledges that the bonuses only affect a small percentage of workers, it does not provide specific data on the actual number or proportion of workers who have received bonuses."}
