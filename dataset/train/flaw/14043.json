{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the increase in funding provided by the national student financial aid scheme (Nsfas) from R70 million in 1994 to nearly R15 billion last year. This is because the expert's verdict mentions that the government has invested more than R2 trillion in infrastructure projects over the past 10 years, suggesting that the increase in Nsfas funding may not be as significant as claimed.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the statement about the increase in Nsfas funding. It does not provide any specific data or sources to verify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in Nsfas funding is a positive development without considering any potential drawbacks or limitations of the program. It does not provide a balanced assessment of the effectiveness or impact of the increased funding.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in Nsfas funding. It does not explore other factors that may have contributed to the increase, such as changes in government policies or economic conditions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the government has invested more than R2 trillion in infrastructure projects over the past 10 years. This suggests that the claim may be overestimating the increase in Nsfas funding in comparison to other government investments.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating the increase in Nsfas funding."}
