{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that Wisconsin's driver licenses and identification cards are \"currently the most secure in the nation.\" This could be seen as an exaggeration because it is a strong and absolute statement without providing sufficient evidence or comparison to other states.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that Wisconsin's licenses are the most secure. The only support mentioned is the addition of the eNotify security feature, which may not be enough to justify the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the security features implemented by Wisconsin, such as polycarbonate cards and raised information, make their licenses the most secure in the nation. However, it does not consider other potential security measures or advancements in other states that may surpass Wisconsin's security standards.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other states may have implemented equally or more secure features in their licenses. It only mentions that some of Wisconsin's security features have been adopted by other states, but it does not provide information on the overall security measures adopted by those states."}
