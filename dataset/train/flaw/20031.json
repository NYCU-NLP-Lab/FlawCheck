{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of pollution produced by China by stating that it produces 90% of the world's carbon emissions pollution, when in reality it is closer to 30%.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that China produces 90% of the world's carbon emissions pollution.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the findings of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), which shows that China is responsible for about 30% of the total emissions, not 90%.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that China is the sole or primary contributor to carbon emissions pollution, without considering the emissions produced by other countries.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that contribute to carbon emissions pollution, such as the emissions produced by other countries or industries."}
