{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the road in the photographs and the Build Build Build program, implying that it is a Chinese-funded road under Duterte's flagship infrastructure program.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the road in the photographs is indeed part of Duterte's infrastructure program or that it is Chinese-funded.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the road in the photographs is a representation of the overall quality and success of Duterte's Build Build Build program, without considering alternative explanations or factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation provided by Regina Samson from the Quezon city government's communications center, who stated that the road was a local government project and not part of the Build Build Build program.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the road in the photographs is a local government project and not funded by China, as confirmed by Anna Mae Yu Lamentillo, chairwoman of the Build Build Build infrastructure program.", "Understate": "The claim understates the significance of the road in the photographs, presenting it as a minor issue within the Build Build Build program, when in fact it is unrelated to the program altogether.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misattributing the road's construction and collapse to Duterte's program, when it was actually a local government project constructed in the 1970s."}
