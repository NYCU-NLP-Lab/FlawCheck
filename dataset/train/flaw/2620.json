{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the difference in spending between prisons and schools by stating that Texas spends \"more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student.\" The claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support this statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the comparison between prison spending and education spending. It only provides a statement from a former teacher and mentions previous claims made by politicians and news outlets without providing specific sources or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that comparing per day spending on inmates and students is an accurate representation of budget priorities. It does not take into account the different costs and services associated with housing inmates and educating students.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that comparing prison and school spending is a common practice to highlight unbalanced budget priorities. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors influencing the perceived disparity in spending.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that prisons are 24/7 operations that provide housing, meals, rehabilitation programs, and other services for a housed population, while students attend school for a limited number of hours per day and for a specific number of days per year. This contradicts the claim that Texas spends more per day on inmates than on students.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any biases."}
