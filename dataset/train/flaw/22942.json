{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent of farmers declaring bankruptcy \"in record numbers.\" The expert's verdict mentions that historical data does not support the claim of \"record\" declarations among farmers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict mentions that historical data does not prove the claim and it is too early to gauge the impact of trade policies on bankruptcies.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that President Donald Trump's trade wars are causing farmers to declare bankruptcy. The expert's verdict states that it is unclear whether the administration's trade policies are a factor in bankruptcies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are several types of bankruptcy proceedings that farmers can file for, not just Chapter 12, which is the one referred to in the claim. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for bankruptcy filings among farmers.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a complete picture of the situation. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim gives an incomplete picture of the median income for farmers and the impact of trade policies on bankruptcies.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Contradict fact": "There is no evidence of contradicting factual information in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
