{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of diabetes patients who cannot afford their insulin by stating that \"one out of 4 diabetes patients in our country cannot afford their insulin.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the study cited by Harris' campaign is small and limited to one metropolitan area, suggesting that it may not accurately represent the national situation.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study cited by Harris' campaign is small and limited to one metropolitan area, and another study conducted by the American Diabetes Association only polled about 530 people online. This suggests that there may not be enough support or evidence to fully substantiate the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the inability to afford insulin is solely due to high prescription drug prices. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to the affordability issue, such as insurance coverage or access to healthcare.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why diabetes patients may not be able to afford their insulin. It solely focuses on the price of insulin without exploring other potential factors that could contribute to the issue.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times due to the lack of comprehensive data and reliance on small-scale studies. This could undermine the accuracy and reliability of the claim.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating the number of diabetes patients who cannot afford their insulin."}
