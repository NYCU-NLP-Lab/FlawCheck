{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of P V Narasimha Rao being the first non-Gandhi Congress Prime Minister by stating that there were hardly any non-Gandhi prime ministers in the country.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that P V Narasimha Rao was the first non-Gandhi Congress Prime Minister.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there should have been more non-Gandhi prime ministers from the Congress party, without providing a clear rationale or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that may have influenced the selection of prime ministers within the Congress party."}
