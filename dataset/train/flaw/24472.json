{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Nancy Pelosi delayed coronavirus funding for the purpose of campaigning on it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Pelosi intentionally delayed the bill solely for political reasons, without considering other possible factors or motivations.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that President Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill on March 6, suggesting that Pelosi's delay was the sole reason for the bill not being passed earlier.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the bipartisan support and cooperation that existed in passing the emergency spending bill, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the delay, such as Democrats' attempts to limit the cost of vaccines and treatments, which the claim does not acknowledge.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting the Red State report as evidence, which is based on comments made by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy but does not provide conclusive proof of Pelosi's deliberate delay for political purposes.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of the campaign ads released by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, implying a direct connection between the delay and the ad campaign, which the expert's verdict does not support."}
