{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which President Obama is attacking oil industry subsidies, as it states that he is \"attacking\" them, implying a strong and aggressive stance.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that the subsidies don't exist. It relies on the statement of Rep. Bill Johnson and the argument made by the American Petroleum Institute and other GOP politicians, but doesn't provide concrete evidence or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because oil companies don't receive direct payments from the U.S. Treasury, the tax breaks they receive should not be considered subsidies. This assumption may be problematic as it overlooks the potential impact and value of these tax breaks to the oil industry.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim dismisses the idea of oil industry subsidies by presenting an alternative explanation that the tax breaks are not subsidies but rather similar to those received by other businesses. This alternative explanation may overlook the potential differences and preferential treatment given to the oil industry in the tax code."}
