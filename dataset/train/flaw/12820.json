{"Falters at times": "The claim made by Governor Chris Christie about gross income tax receipts exceeding projections for the fiscal year prior to Hurricane Sandy is accurate, but there was no growth in income tax revenue through August, and receipts actually fell nearly 1 percent.", "Lack enough support": "While the claim is supported by the increase in income tax receipts in September and October, there is no mention of the specific projections made by the Administration that were exceeded.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in income tax receipts is solely due to the state's improving economy, without considering other factors such as the extra payday in October or the accounting shift related to Tropical Storm Irene.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in income tax receipts, such as the impact of the extra payday in October or the accounting shift related to Tropical Storm Irene.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there was no growth in income tax revenue through August, with receipts falling nearly 1 percent.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of other factors, such as the extra payday in October and the accounting shift related to Tropical Storm Irene, on the increase in income tax receipts.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim."}
