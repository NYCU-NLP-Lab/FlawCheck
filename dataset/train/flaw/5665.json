{"Understate": "The claim states that \"Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments.\" However, the expert's verdict reveals that in 2014, public spending on transportation infrastructure actually totaled 1.6 percent of GDP, which is higher than the claim suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any specific evidence or sources to support the statement about the percentage of GDP spent on infrastructure projects. It lacks sufficient data or references to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the decrease in the percentage of GDP spent on infrastructure projects is inherently negative or detrimental to the nation's future. This assumption may be debatable and subjective, as it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the decrease in spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are varying definitions of what constitutes infrastructure, and different studies may include different elements in their calculations. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the difference in spending percentages, such as changes in the definition of infrastructure or the inclusion of additional infrastructure components in recent years.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that \"Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments.\" However, the expert's verdict provides evidence that in 2014, public spending on transportation infrastructure actually amounted to 1.6 percent of GDP, contradicting the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim emphasizes the decrease in the percentage of GDP spent on infrastructure projects by comparing it to the 1960s. While there has been a decrease, the claim's wording may exaggerate the extent of the decrease and its impact on infrastructure investment.", "Falters at times": "The claim's statement about the percentage of GDP spent on infrastructure projects \"falters\" because it does not accurately represent the current spending level, as revealed by the expert's verdict. It presents an incomplete or misleading picture of the actual spending situation."}
