{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Fox News has made statements about going to jail for not buying health insurance, as the expert's research suggests that nobody on Fox News has made such a statement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or examples to support its assertion that nobody on Fox News has ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if nobody on Fox News has said you're going to jail for not buying health insurance, then it has never been said at all. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the possibility that such statements may have been made by individuals not affiliated with Fox News.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that statements about going to jail for not buying health insurance may have been made by individuals or sources other than Fox News."}
