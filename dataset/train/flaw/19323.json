{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Maxine Waters could become chair of the committee with the power to subpoena President Trump's bank records.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters would automatically become the chair of the committee, which may not necessarily be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for why Maxine Waters has been vocal about investigating Trump's ties to Russia, such as her personal beliefs or political motivations, rather than solely being driven by her potential position as committee chair."}
