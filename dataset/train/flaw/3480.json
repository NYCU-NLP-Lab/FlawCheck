{"Understate": "The claim may understate the potential for adding more to the national debt in the future, as the expert's analysis reveals projected deficits every year for the next 10 years.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on statements made by President Obama and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, but does not provide concrete evidence or data to back up the assertion that the budget will not add more to the national debt.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim relies on the assumption that the proposed budget's spending cuts will be effective in matching annual spending with annual revenues, without considering potential obstacles or unforeseen circumstances that could impact the budget's implementation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claim, such as political rhetoric or a strategic messaging tactic to gain public support for the budget proposal, rather than a factual statement about the actual impact on the national debt."}
