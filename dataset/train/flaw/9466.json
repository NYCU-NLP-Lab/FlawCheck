{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of children who have lost their Head Start slots due to the sequester. The expert's verdict mentions that Head Start enrollment hit record highs in recent years, and Congress decided to spend more money on Head Start to maintain enrollment for eligible children.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a letter that \"up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start services.\" However, it does not provide further evidence or data to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the sequester is the sole cause of the 70,000 children losing their Head Start slots. The expert's verdict does not provide information about other factors that may have contributed to this outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Head Start enrollment hit record highs in recent years due to the Obama administration's expansion of eligibility. This suggests that the increase in eligible children could have played a role in the reduction of slots available.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Head Start enrollment increased in recent years, as mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict mentions that Congress halted the furlough of air traffic controllers due to complaints about airport delays caused by the sequester. This suggests that Congress has taken action to mitigate the impact of the sequester in certain areas, which may imply that they have also taken steps to address the issue of children losing their Head Start slots.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating the number of children who have lost their Head Start slots."}
