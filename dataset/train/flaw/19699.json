{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the average debt upon college graduation in Oregon. The claim states that the average debt is \"more than $24,000,\" but the expert's verdict provides evidence that the average debt is actually slightly less than $24,810, which is the U.S. average.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement. The expert's verdict provides sources such as the Center for American Progress and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Household Debt and Credit Report to support the average debt figure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average debt mentioned is solely for college graduates in Oregon. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that the figure includes both public and private universities and also takes into account students who drop out or never graduate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the average debt figure. The expert's verdict mentions that the average debt per borrower in Oregon is slightly less than the U.S. average, suggesting that there may be factors influencing the debt amount beyond just the cost of education in Oregon.", "Understate": "The claim may be seen as understating the average debt burden by only mentioning the $24,000 figure. The expert's verdict provides additional information that many students in Oregon are in debt ranging from $50,000 to $100,000, which is not mentioned in the claim."}
