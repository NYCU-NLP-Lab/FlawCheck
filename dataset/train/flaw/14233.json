{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that no tear gas or rubber bullets were used, when evidence suggests that pepper balls containing a chemical irritant that matches a federal definition of tear gas were used.", "Understate": "The claim understates the use of force by federal police in clearing the area, as multiple eyewitnesses and news accounts reported the use of tear gas or noxious fumes causing protesters' eyes and throats to burn.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is evidence from eyewitnesses and news accounts that contradicts the statement made by the White House press secretary.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that tear gas and rubber bullets were not used based solely on the statement of the White House press secretary, despite evidence to the contrary.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as federal police used pepper balls instead of tear gas or rubber bullets, which still caused pain and discomfort on impact."}
