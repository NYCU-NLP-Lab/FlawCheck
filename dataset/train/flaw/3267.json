{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which ISIS was considered too extreme by al-Qaida. The expert's verdict states that the differences between the Islamic State and al-Qaida are more deep-rooted than just being \"too extreme.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that ISIS was cast off by al-Qaida because it was considered too extreme. The expert's verdict mentions the formal severing of ties between al-Qaida and ISIS, but it does not explicitly state that it was due to extremism.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being considered \"too extreme\" was the sole reason for al-Qaida casting off ISIS. The expert's verdict suggests that there are deeper reasons for the differences between the two groups.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the severing of ties between al-Qaida and ISIS, suggesting that the evolution of the Islamic State's ambitions and its positioning as an alternative to al-Qaida played a role.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that al-Qaida formally severed ties with ISIS, as reported by the Washington Post. The claim implies that ISIS was cast off by al-Qaida solely because it was considered too extreme.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the relationship between al-Qaida and ISIS, as well as the reasons for their separation. The expert's verdict suggests that the differences between the two groups go beyond just extremism."}
