{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks basic information such as where and when the girl went missing, when and where she was last seen, and contact information for her parents and local authorities.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that forwarding the email will help in finding the missing girl, without providing any evidence or explanation for why this would be the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim is identified as a potential hoax or false report, falling into the category of hoaxes imploring readers to look for children who aren't missing or don't exist. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim uses emotional language and urges recipients to forward the email to everyone they know, exaggerating the urgency and importance of the situation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim includes phrases taken word-for-word from previous missing child hoax emails, indicating that it contradicts the fact that a genuine missing child is being reported.", "Understate": "It is not mentioned explicitly in the expert's verdict, but the claim may be understating the seriousness of missing children cases by potentially spreading false information or diverting attention from genuine cases."}
