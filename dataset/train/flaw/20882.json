{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Ben Unger supported a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors. The only source provided is a news article about tax increases for school construction and operations, which does not directly support the claim about Unger's support for a property tax increase on seniors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting tax increases is inherently negative, particularly for seniors. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider the context or reasoning behind Unger's potential support for the tax increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Unger's stance on the property tax increase. The claim does not explore any other possible reasons or motivations for his position, leaving room for alternative explanations.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the impact or significance of Unger's alleged support for a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors. Without further information or analysis, it is difficult to determine the full extent of the potential consequences of such a tax increase.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim, as the provided information does not present any concrete evidence to confirm or refute Unger's support for the tax increase.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear exaggeration in the claim, as the provided information does not present any specific details or figures that could be exaggerated.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in terms of providing clear and direct evidence to support the assertion. It jumps from discussing Unger's involvement in student protests and campaign work to a news article about school tax increases, without directly connecting Unger to the specific claim about supporting a property tax increase on seniors."}
