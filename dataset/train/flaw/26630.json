{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the percentage of Americans who pay no income tax. While the expert's verdict confirms that around 46-47% of tax filers paid no income tax in 2011 and 2009, it does not necessarily represent the entire population of Americans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the statement that 47% of Americans pay no income tax. The expert's verdict provides some information about tax filers, but it does not directly address the entire American population.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that those who pay no income tax are solely dependent on the government and believe they are entitled to various benefits. This assumption may be seen as problematic as it oversimplifies the reasons why individuals may not pay income tax.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why individuals may not pay income tax. It implies that those who do not pay income tax are solely dependent on the government, which may overlook other factors such as low income levels or tax exemptions.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict confirms that the claim made by Mitt Romney is accurate in terms of the percentage of tax filers who pay no income tax. Therefore, it does not contradict any factual information.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim falters at times or is inconsistent. The expert's verdict supports the accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate the percentage of Americans who pay no income tax. It accurately represents the information provided by the expert's verdict."}
