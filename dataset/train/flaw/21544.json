{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because Michael Yeadon was once Pfizer's chief scientific officer, his statement about the pandemic and vaccines should be given more credibility. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that Yeadon's role at Pfizer was not directly related to vaccines or infectious diseases.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that there is no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. The expert's verdict mentions that Yeadon's claims have been proven to be unambiguously incorrect.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that Yeadon's views on COVID-19, lockdowns, and vaccination have gained attention on certain corners of the internet, implying that alternative explanations or motivations may exist for his statements.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Yeadon's title at Pfizer was not \"chief scientist of Pfizer\" or \"chief scientific officer of Pfizer,\" as stated in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate Yeadon's role and authority within Pfizer, suggesting a higher level of expertise or influence than he actually had.", "Understate": "There is no evident understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not necessarily falter at times but rather presents a misleading representation of Yeadon's position and credentials."}
