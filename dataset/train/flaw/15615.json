{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it states that El Paso is the \"safest city of our size in the nation.\" While it may have low crime rates, it may not necessarily be the absolute safest city in the entire nation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the 2013 CQ Press rankings and a press release from the city of El Paso. It would require more comprehensive and up-to-date data to fully support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being the \"safest city of our size\" is directly linked to the security of the U.S.-Mexico border. This assumption may be problematic as there could be other factors contributing to the city's safety.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for El Paso's low crime rates, such as socio-economic factors, community programs, or law enforcement strategies. It solely attributes the safety to the security of the border."}
