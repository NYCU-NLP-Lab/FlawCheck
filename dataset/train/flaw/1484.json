{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the celebration of average Kashmiris by stating that they are celebrating the integration with Mighty India, without providing enough evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a video that is four months old and not representative of the current situation after the government's decision to deem Article 370 ineffective.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video represents children in Kashmir celebrating the government's move on Article 370, but it has been debunked as an old BJP rally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation exists in the fact that the video is not recent and does not accurately represent the current sentiments of children in Kashmir."}
