{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Hillary Clinton's tax proposal by stating that \"hundreds of thousands of jobs [would] disappear,\" which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual findings of the Tax Foundation study, which projected slightly less job growth under Clinton's plan compared to current law, but not the disappearance of jobs.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the assertion that \"hundreds of thousands of jobs [would] disappear\" as a result of Clinton's tax proposal, as the evidence provided contradicts this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that raising taxes would automatically lead to job loss, which is not supported by the evidence provided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the impact of Clinton's tax proposal, such as the projection of a gain of 19 million jobs over 10 years according to another study by Mark Zandi and colleagues at Moody's Analytics."}
