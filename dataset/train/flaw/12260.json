{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a film studio executive in the mid-1990s proposed casting Julia Roberts as Harriet Tubman, which is considered a problematic assumption because it implies that the executive lacked knowledge or understanding of the historical context and the importance of casting a black actress for the role.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard remains unproven and that there is no verified evidence or information to support the assertion that a Hollywood film executive actually proposed casting Julia Roberts as Tubman.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the executive's proposal was based on the assumption that \"it was so long ago\" that no one would notice or care about the difference in race. This alternative explanation highlights a biased perspective that underestimates the significance of accurate representation and fails to acknowledge the importance of casting actors who reflect the racial and historical context of the characters they portray.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Julia Roberts, a white actress, was never cast as Harriet Tubman. This contradiction highlights the absurdity of the proposal and emphasizes the lack of credibility in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration or a sensationalized anecdote, as it gained widespread attention and was widely reported by various media outlets. The inclusion of Wendy Williams' strong reaction to the claim also adds to the sensationalized nature of the story.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the potential impact or consequences of such a proposal, as it fails to fully address the historical and cultural implications of casting a white actress as an iconic black historical figure like Harriet Tubman."}
