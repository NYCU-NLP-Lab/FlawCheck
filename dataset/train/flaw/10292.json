{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Cory Aquino's presidency was unconstitutional contradicts the fact that the Philippine Supreme Court ruled her government legitimate at least twice in 1986.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the significance of Arturo Tolentino as the \"REAL President\" from 1986 to 1992, disregarding Aquino's legitimacy as the elected President.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove the assertion that Aquino's presidency was unconstitutional.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the automatic succession of the Vice President to the presidency in case of the President's death or removal is unconstitutional, without providing sufficient justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that Aquino's presidency was recognized by the Philippine Supreme Court and the international community, indicating its legitimacy."}
