{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the economic impact of pre-K investment by stating that for every $1 invested, $1.79 is generated in total spending within the state. The expert suggests that the estimate of an additional 79 cents generated per dollar of spending is probably high.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack sufficient evidence or support to back up the economic impact study's findings. The expert mentions that the statistic was obtained from the Economy League and a study from ReadyNation/America's Edge, but it is unclear if there are other studies or data supporting the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the money spent on pre-kindergarten would lead to new learning centers, new teachers and staff, and increased demand for goods and services. This assumption may not always hold true and could be considered problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the estimate of an additional 79 cents generated per dollar of spending may not take into account possible tax increases, which are often used to finance early childhood education programs. This alternative explanation could affect the actual economic impact of pre-K investment."}
