{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerated as it states that Brendan Kelly had \"50% of crimes pled out\" without providing any evidence or context to support this statistic.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or data to validate the statement about Brendan Kelly's track record as a state's attorney.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that having a high percentage of crimes pled out is inherently negative or indicative of a failure, without considering potential reasons or circumstances behind plea agreements.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the high percentage of crimes pled out, such as the efficiency of the legal system or the strength of the evidence in those cases. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine if this bias exists in the claim."}
