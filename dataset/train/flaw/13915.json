{"Understate": "The claim states that Tiger Woods has had \"other vehicle crashes\" prior to the one in February 2021. The expert's verdict confirms that Woods was involved in one other high-profile collision in November 2009. However, it does not provide information on any additional vehicle crashes that Woods may have been involved in, suggesting that the claim may be understating the number of previous crashes.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions only one previous collision involving Tiger Woods in November 2009. While this supports the claim to some extent, it does not provide sufficient evidence or information about any other vehicle crashes that Woods may have had. This lack of additional support weakens the claim's assertion of multiple prior crashes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim implies that the February 2021 crash may not be an isolated incident, suggesting that there may be a pattern of vehicle crashes involving Tiger Woods. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any alternative explanations for the February 2021 crash or any potential patterns. It only confirms the previous high-profile collision in 2009. Therefore, the presence of alternative explanations is not directly addressed in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict provides information about Tiger Woods' previous collision in 2009 but does not consistently address the claim's assertion of \"other vehicle crashes.\" This inconsistency in addressing the claim's specific statement suggests that the expert's verdict falters in fully addressing the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Tiger Woods has had other vehicle crashes prior to the one in February 2021. While the expert's verdict confirms one previous high-profile collision in 2009, it does not explicitly state or provide evidence of any additional crashes. Therefore, the claim's assumption of multiple prior crashes may be problematic.", "Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict does not provide any information or evidence that contradicts the claim's assertion of Tiger Woods having other vehicle crashes prior to February 2021. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict does not contradict the fact that Tiger Woods was involved in one other high-profile collision in 2009. Therefore, there is no contradiction of fact in the claim."}
