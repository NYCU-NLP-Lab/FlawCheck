{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on the hypothesis of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) and the discovery of bones on Nikumaroro Island. However, the bones were originally described as belonging to a stocky Polynesian male, not Amelia Earhart.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim is based on the assumption that the bones found on Nikumaroro Island belong to Amelia Earhart. This assumption is problematic because the original description of the bones does not match Earhart's physical characteristics.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the bones found on Nikumaroro Island, such as the possibility that they belong to a stocky Polynesian male and not Amelia Earhart. This alternative explanation challenges the claim made by TIGHAR.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the bones found on Nikumaroro Island were originally described as belonging to a stocky Polynesian male, not Amelia Earhart. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the challenges and uncertainties surrounding the identification of the bones found on Nikumaroro Island as belonging to Amelia Earhart. The claim presents the identification as being \"99% certain,\" but the contradictory evidence and lack of current knowledge of the whereabouts of the bones suggest a higher level of uncertainty.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times in providing a clear and conclusive explanation for the fate of Amelia Earhart. Despite the efforts of TIGHAR and other search parties, the wreckage of Earhart's plane and her remains have never been conclusively located. This indicates that the claim may not be fully supported by the available evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the discovery of bones on Nikumaroro Island as being \"99% certain\" to belong to Amelia Earhart. The contradictory evidence and lack of current knowledge about the bones cast doubt on this level of certainty."}
