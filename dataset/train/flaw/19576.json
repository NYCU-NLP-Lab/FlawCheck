{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that farmers across Punjab and Haryana are soaking wheat bags in water to rot them and sell them off to breweries and distilleries. This may be an exaggeration as there is no evidence provided to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that farmers are soaking wheat bags in water.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of a man sprinkling water on wheat bags is evidence of farmers soaking wheat bags to increase weight. However, there is no direct evidence or confirmation that this is the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the act of sprinkling water on wheat bags, such as a different purpose or practice that is not related to increasing weight or engaging in fraudulent activities."}
