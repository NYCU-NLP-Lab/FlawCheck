{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as an exaggeration because it portrays Tammy Baldwin's support for the Department of Peace and Nonviolence as a fundamentally unserious answer to the question of national security.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or specific details about the legislation or Baldwin's involvement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting the Department of Peace and Nonviolence is incompatible with keeping the American people safe, which can be seen as a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Baldwin's support for the Department of Peace and Nonviolence, such as a belief in nonviolent solutions to conflicts, but these are not explored in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Baldwin has also backed certain national defense measures as a senator, suggesting that she does consider national security.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a clear connection between Baldwin's cosponsorship of the Department of Peace legislation and her ability to keep the American people safe."}
