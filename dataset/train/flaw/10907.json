{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Trump's belief by stating that he \"believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.\" This is an exaggeration because Trump expressed sympathy for low-wage workers and stated that he thinks people should get more than the current minimum wage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to fully substantiate Trump's stance on the minimum wage. The provided evidence includes various statements from Trump that seem to contradict each other, making it difficult to determine his exact position.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Trump's belief in states having the right to lower the minimum wage contradicts the fact that the federal minimum wage is currently set at $7.25. However, Trump's statements suggest that he believes the states should decide on the minimum wage, but also expresses sympathy for low-wage workers and acknowledges the challenges of living on the current minimum wage.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Trump's statements on the minimum wage are inconsistent, and his views may have evolved or changed over time. The claim does not fully address this inconsistency and presents Trump's stance as definitive."}
