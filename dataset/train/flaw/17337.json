{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of illegal immigrants who might have voted in 2008 by stating that it is 5.7 million, without sufficient evidence to support such a high number.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a small subset of respondents from a survey, which may not be reliable for extrapolating to millions of illegal voters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of noncitizen voters can be accurately estimated based on the responses of a small subset of respondents, which may not be a valid assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations and disagreements among experts regarding the number of noncitizen voters, as evidenced by the open letter from political scientists disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump's claim."}
