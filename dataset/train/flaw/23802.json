{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the incident of throwing money on the streets was specifically done by an Indian millionaire to celebrate PM Modi's return to power. The evidence provided only shows a video of an individual throwing money, but it does not establish the person's identity or their motive.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the person throwing money on the streets is an Indian millionaire celebrating PM Modi's return to power. This assumption is not supported by any concrete evidence and is based on speculation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation for the incident shown in the video. The video was originally uploaded on YouTube with the title \"Money Shower - The God Joe Kush throwing real $5 Bills on 47th street in the diamonds district in NY.\" This suggests that the person in the video is Joe Kush, a video engineer and music producer, and the act of throwing money may not be related to PM Modi's victory.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video was not related to PM Modi's victory, but rather a separate incident of money shower carried out by Joe Kush in New York.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of any understatement bias in the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of any exaggeration bias in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of any faltering bias in the claim."}
