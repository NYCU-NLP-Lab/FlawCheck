{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no direct evidence or conclusive information linking the deaths of the school boys to wearing face masks during physical exercise.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that wearing face masks during physical exercise caused the sudden deaths of the school boys, which is a problematic assumption as there is no clear causal relationship established.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that it is unknown whether the boys' wearing face masks played any role in their deaths, indicating that there could be alternative explanations for their sudden deaths.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the uncertainties and complexities surrounding the deaths of the school boys by presenting a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship between wearing face masks and their deaths.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the cause of the boys' deaths is unknown and that it is uncertain whether wearing face masks played any role in their deaths.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of wearing face masks during physical exercise by attributing the sudden deaths solely to this factor without sufficient evidence."}
