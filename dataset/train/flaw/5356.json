{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who have interacted with the fake job ads by stating that \"More than 400 people have commented on the post since it was published.\" This number may be an exaggeration or may not accurately represent the number of people who have interacted with the ads.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that the job ads are genuine. The evidence provided includes statements from KFC and Coca-Cola representatives stating that the ads are fake, which contradicts the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the job ads are genuine without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. The evidence provided actually supports the opposite conclusion, as representatives from KFC and Coca-Cola have stated that the ads are fake.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that the job ads are fake, as confirmed by the representatives from KFC and Coca-Cola. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the ads are genuine."}
