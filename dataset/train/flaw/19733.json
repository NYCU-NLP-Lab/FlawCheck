{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible source provided to prove that Disney animators hid a risqu\u00e9 image in sand dunes in \"The Lion King\" animated film.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Disney animators intentionally inserted risqu\u00e9 images in their films, which is a problematic assumption without concrete evidence.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the existence and prevalence of risqu\u00e9 images hidden in Disney films by stating that it is a common occurrence, when in fact, most of these claims are based on fleeting and difficult-to-discern imagery or are digitally manipulated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the image of nipples on the sand dunes in \"The Lion King\" is not a genuine still frame from the film, but a digital alteration created by an outsider.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the claim, as the manipulated image of the sand dunes with nipples was created for a photoplasty contest hosted by the Cracked website, rather than being a genuine Easter egg hidden by Disney animators.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any information or downplays the significance of the alleged risqu\u00e9 image."}
