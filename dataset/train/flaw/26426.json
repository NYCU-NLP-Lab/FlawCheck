{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that Obama and his administration are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan, which implies a significant and ongoing action.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that Nestle is exporting water from Lake Michigan or that Obama's administration is involved in this action.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the use of a \"little-known loophole\" in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact is being exploited to allow Nestle to export water. However, it does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of Nestle's facilities in the Great Lakes basin or the export of water."}
