{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the number of people who have been dropped from their coverage compared to those who have enrolled in Obamacare. The expert's analysis suggests that the number of cancellations is likely between 130,000 and 168,000, while the number of enrollments is 413,410.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that for every Kentuckian enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage. The expert's analysis mentions the difficulty in tracking cancellations and provides a range of potential cancellation numbers, but it does not provide a direct comparison to the number of enrollments.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of cancellations is directly tied to the number of enrollments in Obamacare. However, the expert's analysis highlights that cancellations are issued by private health insurance companies, and regulations differ in each state, making it difficult to establish a direct correlation between the two.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a negative view of Obamacare, suggesting that it is not good for America or Kentucky. However, the expert's analysis does not provide alternative explanations or perspectives on the impact of Obamacare in Kentucky."}
