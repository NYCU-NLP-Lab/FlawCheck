{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact that being included in the top line of polls would have on Gary Johnson's support, suggesting that he would be at 20 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to back up the assertion that Johnson would be at 20 percent if included in the top line of polls.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that being included in the top line of polls is the only factor influencing Johnson's support and his ability to qualify for debates.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Johnson's lower level of support, such as his policies or campaign strategies.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by making contradictory statements, such as suggesting that none of the polls have Johnson on the top line, but later acknowledging that some polls do include him in the first question.", "Understate": "The claim understates the impact of other factors, such as the Committee on Presidential Debates' requirement of reaching 15 percent in select polls, on Johnson's ability to qualify for debates.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that including Johnson in the first horse-race question of polls did not result in higher average performance for him."}
