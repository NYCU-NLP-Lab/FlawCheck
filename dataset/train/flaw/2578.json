{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Virginia's drop in the number of abortions by stating that it had the \"steepest\" drop compared to any other state.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the impact of new Democratic majorities in the General Assembly on the decline of abortions in Virginia, as predicted by The Family Foundation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Virginia had the steepest drop in the number of abortions between 2011 and 2017, as it only refers to a blog post by The Family Foundation and a report by the Guttmacher Institute without providing further evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new Democratic majorities in the General Assembly will halt the decline of abortions in Virginia, which may be a problematic assumption without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the decline in abortions in Virginia, such as fewer pregnancies and greater access to contraception, as suggested by the Guttmacher Institute."}
