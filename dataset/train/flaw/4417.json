{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a viral image shared on social media without any credible evidence or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the image of deers sitting on the road is from the Ooty-Coimbatore road in India during the coronavirus lockdown, which is a problematic assumption as it is later found to be from Nara Park in Japan.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the viral image is actually from Nara Park in Japan, as confirmed by a reverse image search and reports from Japan Today and SoraNews24.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for the presence of deers in Nara Park, which is that they have been carefully protected as \"natural monuments\" due to their association with a deity and the park's historical significance.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that the road is \"reclaimed by deers,\" implying that they have taken over the entire road, when in reality the image only shows a few deers sitting on the road.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by relying on social media users and a journalist's tweet without verifying the authenticity of the image or its context.", "Other biases": "None of the other biases listed (such as \"Framing,\" \"Emotional language,\" etc.) are present in the provided claim."}
