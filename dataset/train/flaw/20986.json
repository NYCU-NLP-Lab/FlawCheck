{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the actions of the migrants by stating that they stand on and urinate on the U.S. flag before throwing it in the trash can.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that migrants in the Guatemalan Caravan have neither dragged nor brutalized police officers, burned the American flag, or defaced it with a swastika.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that migrants in the Guatemalan Caravan have performed the actions described.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the actions described are true without providing substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the picture, stating that it is not current and is from a protest at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2016. This suggests that the claim's interpretation of the picture is incorrect."}
