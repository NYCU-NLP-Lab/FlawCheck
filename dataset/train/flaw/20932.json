{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the rarity of major oil spills from drilling accidents, stating that the last one happened over 40 years ago in 1969.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America occurred in 1969.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of major oil spills from drilling accidents in the past 40 years implies the safety of drilling methods.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or factors that contribute to the absence of major oil spills from drilling accidents in recent years, which the claim fails to acknowledge."}
