{"Exaggerate": "The expert's verdict states that President Trump falsely claimed that the trade agreement with China \"will boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year.\" The actual agreement only requires China to increase agricultural purchases by $12.5 billion this year and $19.5 billion next year compared to 2017 levels. Therefore, the claim exaggerates the impact of the trade agreement.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that while it is possible for China to purchase $50 billion a year in U.S. agricultural products in 2023, there is no requirement for China to increase purchases beyond 2021. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support to substantiate the $50 billion boost to American agriculture every year.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the trade agreement with China will lead to a $50 billion boost in American agriculture every year. However, the expert's verdict states that there is no guarantee of such an increase beyond 2021. Therefore, the claim makes a problematic assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim made by President Trump regarding the impact of the trade agreement on American agriculture. The claim states that the agreement will boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year, while the expert's verdict clarifies that the actual increase in agricultural purchases is much lower.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
