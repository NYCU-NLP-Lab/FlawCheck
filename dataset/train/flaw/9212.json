{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Pakistan Super League cricket matches will resume on March 11, 2021 lacks enough support as there are no credible media reports or PCB statements to suggest this date.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the provided text graphic on Facebook is accurate and official, without verifying its authenticity.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement made by the PCB's Chief Executive Wasim Khan, who mentioned that a date to resume the tournament has not yet been decided.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by ESPNcricinfo, which suggests that the tournament is likely to resume in May 2021.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it relies on a Facebook post with a caption stating \"Big News,\" which may indicate a lack of reliability or credibility.", "Understate": "The claim may potentially understate the uncertainty surrounding the resumption date of the Pakistan Super League cricket matches, as the PCB's Chief Executive mentioned that matches will be held before the end of the year without specifying a specific date.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim exaggerates the resumption date, as it simply states that the matches will resume on March 11, 2021, without any additional embellishment."}
