{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the threat of HIV contamination in Cadbury products by stating that a worker contaminated the products with his HIV-positive blood.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the accusation that a Cadbury worker contaminated the products with his blood.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that consuming Cadbury products could lead to contracting HIV, which is a problematic assumption as HIV cannot be transmitted through food consumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no arrests have been made and no warnings or recalls have been issued regarding Cadbury products being contaminated with HIV.", "Understate": "None apparent.", "Falters at times": "None apparent.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the photo used in the post, which is actually of a Boko Haram terrorist and not an HIV-positive Cadbury worker."}
