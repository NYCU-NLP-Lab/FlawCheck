{"Understate": "The claim understates the number of constituencies that voted to leave and remain in the EU referendum. The expert's verdict provides more detailed information about the breakdown of constituencies and regions that voted for each option, which contradicts the simplified claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only provides the overall numbers of people who voted to leave and remain without providing any additional evidence or data to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the only two options in the EU referendum were to leave or remain, without considering any alternative explanations or options.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider any alternative explanations for the voting results in the EU referendum, such as factors influencing people's decisions or other parties involved.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there are 650 constituencies in the UK, but the numbers provided in the claim only add up to 648. This discrepancy undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence of exaggeration in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
