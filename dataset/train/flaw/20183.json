{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the restriction on Republican colleagues from entering the SCIF during the closed-door depositions. Both Democrats and Republicans had access to the SCIF and participated in the proceedings.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Republican committee members were present during the closed-door depositions and had the opportunity to ask questions.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence or specific instances where Republican colleagues were denied access to the SCIF.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Republican colleagues were excluded from the closed-door proceedings without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, as transcripts and testimonies show that Republican committee members were present and actively participated in the closed-door depositions."}
