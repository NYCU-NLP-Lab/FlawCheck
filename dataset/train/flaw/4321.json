{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Boris Johnson said \"people of talent\" instead of \"people of colour.\" This is supported by the video footage and the admission of the mistake by Channel 4.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on tweets and social media reactions rather than concrete evidence or official statements from Boris Johnson.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Boris Johnson's statement about \"people of talent\" is evidence of racism or bias, without considering alternative interpretations or explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation is that Boris Johnson's statement about \"people of talent\" is referring to a merit-based immigration system, rather than being racially biased."}
