{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of U.S. citizens who lost their employer-tied health insurance in March. The expert's verdict states that the number is likely somewhat higher than the estimated figure of 3.5 million.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of U.S. citizens who lost their employer-tied health insurance is significantly higher than the number in other large nations combined. However, the expert's verdict explains that other countries on the list have universal or government-provided health insurance models, which means their citizens are not at risk of losing coverage if they lose their job.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to validate the statement that zero people lost their coverage in 20 other large nations combined. The expert's verdict mentions that the tweet from the progressive think tank does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that while the claim attributes the loss of health insurance to the pandemic, it is possible that some individuals lost their insurance for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the loss of coverage.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that millions of Americans have lost their jobs as a result of the nation shutting down to slow the spread of COVID-19. The expert's verdict highlights the link between job loss and the loss of employer-tied health insurance.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of the data. The expert's verdict points out that the economists who conducted the analysis only examined unemployment claims from the last two weeks of March, potentially underestimating the actual number of people who lost their health insurance.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the number of Americans who lost their employer-tied health insurance in March. The expert's verdict suggests that the real total is likely somewhat higher, especially if individuals who filed for unemployment during the first two weeks of the month are included."}
