{"Understate": "The claim may understate the actual cost of the blood test for coronavirus. The claim states that the cost is $3,200, but the article mentions that the total cost was still unclear and the patient may be responsible for the whole bill unless he provided medical records.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a Facebook post and a single anecdotal story of a man who received a steep medical bill after visiting a hospital. There is no broader evidence or data provided to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of the blood test for coronavirus is prohibitively expensive and that it reflects the overall cost of testing. However, the article mentions that the patient requested a flu test first because he knew he would have to pay out of pocket, suggesting that the cost may vary depending on the type of test.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the high cost of the medical bill, such as the specific circumstances of the patient's treatment, insurance coverage, or billing practices of the hospital. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
