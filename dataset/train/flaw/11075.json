{"Exaggerate": "The claim that the Republican tax plan will be the largest tax cut in U.S. history may be an exaggeration, as past tax cuts have been larger than the cost estimates of the GOP plan.", "Lack enough support": "The White House has not provided support for the claim, and the tax plan is still a framework with many details yet to be filled in.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Republican tax plan will be the largest tax cut in U.S. history without sufficient evidence or confirmation from the White House.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the designation of the \"largest tax cut in history\" would go to either President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut or President Barack Obama's 2012 extension of most of the George W. Bush-era income tax cuts, depending on how the size of the tax cut is measured. This suggests that there are alternative explanations for the claim."}
