{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Sullivan's actions by stating that he \"stood up to his own party\" when he was the only Democrat to vote against the budget.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence to prove that Sullivan consistently worked to control spending, as the campaign did not provide any other instances of him breaking ranks with Democrats on spending issues.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against a specific budget equates to actively working to stop runaway government spending, without considering the broader context of Sullivan's overall record on spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Sullivan's vote against the budget, such as personal or political motivations, which are not addressed in the claim."}
