{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Hillary Clinton has been named the new New York Attorney General, which is not true.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or public record of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo making the statement that Clinton would serve as Attorney General.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that Cuomo has the authority to appoint a new Attorney General, when in fact, according to the state constitution, such vacancies are to be filled by the state Legislature.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Barbara D. Underwood assumed the role of New York Attorney General in an acting capacity after Eric Schneiderman resigned.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that the investigation into Michael Cohen's finances and business deals is being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, not the state attorney general's office."}
