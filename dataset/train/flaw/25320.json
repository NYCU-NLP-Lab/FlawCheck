The expert's analysis shows that the headline is misleading and the actual statement made by Koskinen does not align with the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the IRS actively encourages undocumented immigrants to engage in illegal activities, based on a misinterpretation of Koskinen's statement. However, the expert's analysis clarifies that Koskinen was discussing specific cases where individuals were using Social Security numbers that belonged to someone they knew.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Koskinen did not admit to the IRS encouraging undocumented immigrants to \"steal\" Social Security numbers. The expert's analysis provides a transcript of the relevant portion of the hearing, which clarifies the context of Koskinen's statement.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the use of someone else's Social Security number by undocumented individuals.
