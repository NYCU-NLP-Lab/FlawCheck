{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the fire by stating that the presidential villa was \"razed to the ground\" when in reality, the fire was contained and did not cause any damage to the villa itself.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the claim that the presidential villa was burned down. The only evidence provided is a single image, which is not reliable.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the fire at the Dugbe Market in Ibadan, which occurred a month earlier, is the same fire that affected the presidential villa. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the fire at the presidential villa was contained and did not cause any damage to the villa itself. The expert's verdict provides evidence from official sources confirming this.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the image, such as the possibility of it being a different location or a staged photo.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single image and a post from a page advocating for a separatist state, which raises questions about its credibility and reliability.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual situation by not acknowledging that the fire at the presidential villa was a minor bushfire that was quickly extinguished, without causing any significant damage."}
