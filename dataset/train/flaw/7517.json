{"Exaggerate": "The claim that there are \"Occupy Wall Street camps in hundreds of cities across the United States\" may be an exaggeration since the actual number of cities with protest camps is smaller.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no clear evidence or data provided to support the statement that there are \"hundreds\" of Occupy Wall Street camps in cities across the United States.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of Occupy Wall Street camps in cities across the United States is in the hundreds without providing sufficient evidence or data to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the varying numbers of cities involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, as different sources provide different figures, ranging from \"over 100 cities\" to \"more than 1,500 cities.\" This suggests that the claim may not be accurate or consistent.", "Understate": "It is possible that the claim may understate the actual number of Occupy Wall Street camps in cities across the United States, as some sources mention a higher number of cities involved in the movement. However, this bias is less likely given the lack of consensus among sources.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that there are not actually \"hundreds\" of Occupy Wall Street camps in cities across the United States, as the actual number is smaller according to the investigation mentioned in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in accurately representing the extent of the Occupy Wall Street movement, as different sources provide conflicting information about the number of cities involved."}
