{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or documentation to support the assertion that votes intended for Hillary Clinton are being allocated to Donald Trump on touchscreen voting machines. The expert's verdict mentions that the rumor originated from a single individual's account, which may have been an isolated incident or user error. There is no information provided to suggest that this glitch or error has occurred on a large scale or affected a significant number of voters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reported glitch or error in touchscreen voting machines is intentional and designed to allocate votes from Clinton to Trump. However, the expert's verdict suggests that it is more likely to be an isolated incident or user error rather than a deliberate manipulation of votes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the reported glitch or error in touchscreen voting machines could be attributed to user error or isolated incidents rather than a systematic issue. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that votes are intentionally being allocated from Clinton to Trump.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no substantial evidence or documentation to support the assertion that votes intended for Hillary Clinton are being allocated to Donald Trump on touchscreen voting machines. The expert's verdict provides information that challenges the validity of the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered an exaggeration as it presents a scenario where all touchscreen-based votes for Hillary Clinton are automatically allocated to Donald Trump. The expert's verdict suggests that this scenario is not supported by evidence and is more likely an isolated incident or user error.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing consistent or accurate information about the supposed glitch or error in touchscreen voting machines. The expert's verdict mentions that the warnings about the glitch conflicted with each other regarding the geographic location and lacked useful information to determine the scope of the problem."}
