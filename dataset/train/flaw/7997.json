The expert's verdict mentions a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, but it also notes that the article is not a peer-reviewed study.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not mention any alternative explanations for the potential lifespan of the coronavirus on different surfaces. The expert's verdict, however, mentions that the findings of the study reflect what others have found about the potential longevity of the coronavirus outside the body.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the stated durations for the coronavirus's lifespan on different surfaces are accurate and applicable in all situations. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the study was conducted in a lab setting, which may not fully represent real-life conditions.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not contradict any known facts or information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Exaggerate": "The claim does not appear to exaggerate the potential lifespan of the coronavirus on different surfaces. The durations mentioned in the claim align with the information provided in the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim does not falter at times as it provides specific durations for the coronavirus's lifespan on different surfaces."}
