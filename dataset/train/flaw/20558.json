{"Understate": "The claim may understate the severity of the issue by simply stating that \"over one in 20 children die before their fifth birthday\" without providing further context or comparison to global child mortality rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific sources or data to support the statement that \"over one in 20 children die before their fifth birthday.\" It is not clear where this statistic comes from or how it was calculated.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the high maternal mortality rate in Kenya directly correlates to the high child mortality rate. While there may be a relationship between the two, the claim does not provide evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative factors or explanations that may contribute to the child mortality rate in Kenya, such as access to healthcare, nutrition, or socio-economic factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Kenya is one of 21 countries with a very high ratio of maternal deaths, according to UN estimates. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the severity of the issue in Kenya.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the child mortality rate by using the phrase \"one in 20 children die before their fifth birthday\" without providing specific data or comparison to global child mortality rates. This could create a sense of urgency or alarm to solicit donations.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough context or explanation for the statement. It lacks specific data, sources, or comparisons to support the claim, which weakens its credibility."}
