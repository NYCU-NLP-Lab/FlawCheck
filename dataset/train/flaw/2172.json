{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the statement that there are more people uninsured today than when Obama was elected president. It only references a Gallup poll and does not provide any other supporting information or sources.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of uninsured individuals is solely determined by the federal health care law and does not take into account other factors that could contribute to changes in the uninsured rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the increase in the number of uninsured individuals, such as changes in the economy, job market, or individual choices regarding insurance coverage. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations."}
