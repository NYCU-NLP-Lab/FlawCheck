{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the voter turnout rates in the Michigan precincts, as the expert's verdict states that the affidavit overstates the turnout in these jurisdictions by as much as 10 times.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the official results from the election, which show that none of the Michigan voting jurisdictions listed in the affidavit had 100% turnout or higher.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the expert's verdict provides evidence from official results and analysis that debunk the inaccurate claims made in the affidavit.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voter turnout rates above 100% occurred in the Michigan precincts, which is deemed implausible by the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in accurately representing the voter turnout rates in the Michigan precincts, as it relies on flawed analysis and inaccurate findings from the affidavit.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the discrepancies in the voter turnout rates, such as errors in data analysis or misunderstanding of voting jurisdictions."}
