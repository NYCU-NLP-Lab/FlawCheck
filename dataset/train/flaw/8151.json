{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times is supported by a chart from the Office of Management and Budget, but there are conflicting reports and references that state Reagan only raised the debt limit 17 times. This lack of consensus and conflicting information suggests that the claim may lack enough support.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that raising the debt limit is inherently negative or problematic. However, the context provided in the expert's verdict mentions that raising the debt ceiling has been a routine practice by Congress and presidents since the 1950s. This suggests that the assumption that raising the debt limit is inherently bad may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that two of the 18 bills listed in the Office of Management and Budget chart are listed as boosting the debt limit to the same amount. There is a question of whether these should be counted as one increase or two. This alternative explanation raises the possibility that the claim of 18 debt limit increases may be inflated or exaggerated.", "Contradict fact": "The claim that Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times contradicts other reports and references that state Reagan only raised the debt limit 17 times. This contradiction suggests that the claim may not be entirely accurate.", "Falters at times": "The conflicting information and lack of consensus on the number of debt limit increases during Reagan's presidency suggests that the claim may falter at times in terms of its accuracy and reliability.", "Exaggerate": "The claim that Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times may be an exaggeration if the conflicting reports and references that state Reagan only raised the debt limit 17 times are accurate."}
