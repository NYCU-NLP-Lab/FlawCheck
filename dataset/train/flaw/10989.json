{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Richard Hayne is a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him. The expert's investigation found that Hayne and his wife contributed to Santorum and his political action committee in the past, but there is no evidence of any recent donations to Santorum's presidential campaign.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Hayne's past donations to Santorum indicate ongoing support for him, without considering the possibility that his political preferences may have changed over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim that Hayne is a supporter of Santorum, as the expert's investigation found that Hayne and his wife have also contributed to other politicians from both Republican and Democratic parties. This suggests that their political donations may not be solely indicative of support for Santorum.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Hayne has not contributed to Santorum's presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of Hayne's donations to Santorum by only mentioning a specific amount ($13,000) without providing a broader context or comparison to other contributions.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Hayne's support for Santorum by implying that his donations are a reflection of his personal beliefs and values, without considering other possible motivations for political contributions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by presenting information that is not directly related to Hayne's support for Santorum, such as mentioning controversies surrounding Urban Outfitters and its subsidiaries. This may distract from the main focus of the claim."}
