{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or scientific support to prove that holding one's breath for more than 10 seconds without experiencing any discomfort or coughing can indicate the absence of lung fibrosis or infection.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as it does not consider individual variations in lung capacity and the ability to hold one's breath, which can vary from person to person.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of coughing, discomfort, stuffiness, or tightness during the breath-holding test is a reliable indicator of the absence of lung fibrosis or infection. However, this assumption is not supported by scientific evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that holding one's breath or drinking water cannot prevent or diagnose a new coronavirus infection. Medical experts have stated that there is no evidence to support these claims.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the seriousness of the new coronavirus infection by suggesting a simple breath-holding test as a means of diagnosis or prevention. This undermines the complexity and severity of the virus.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for shortness of breath and coughing, which are listed as symptoms of the new coronavirus by reputable sources such as the NHS and Public Health England. Therefore, these symptoms cannot be solely attributed to lung fibrosis or infection."}
