{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Harry Reid has \"blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years\" when in reality, he has offered up a Keystone vote multiple times.", "Understate": "The claim understates the complexity of the situation by not mentioning that Reid had blocked several Republican amendments to the Shaheen bill, which played a role in the Republicans rejecting his offer and killing the bill.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide specific evidence or examples to back up the assertion that Harry Reid has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of a vote on the Keystone pipeline is solely due to Harry Reid's actions, without considering other factors such as Republican opposition or the complexity of the legislative process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation provided by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who stated that the Republicans refused to allow votes on Keystone because they didn't want the Shaheen bill to pass before the election."}
