{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Florida's high school graduation rates by stating that they are increasing at the fastest rate in the nation and that Florida leads the nation in the rate of Hispanic graduates. The expert's verdict mentions that Florida's graduation rates started at a low point and were slightly below the national average as of 2010.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the challenges and criticisms surrounding Florida's graduation rates. The expert's verdict mentions that the graduation rates can vary depending on the methodology and years examined, and that the cohort method showed that Florida's overall graduation rate was lower than all but five states and the District of Columbia.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement about Florida's graduation rates being the fastest increasing in the nation and leading in the rate of Hispanic graduates. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on Education Week's Diplomas Count analysis, which has been criticized by some education experts.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in graduation rates necessarily indicates improvement in education quality. The expert's verdict mentions that the increase in graduation rates was partly due to higher rates of graduation for Latinos and blacks, but it does not provide information about the quality of education or the factors contributing to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the increase in graduation rates, such as changes in methodology and the starting point of Florida's low graduation rates."}
