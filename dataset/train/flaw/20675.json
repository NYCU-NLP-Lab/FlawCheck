{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the net fiscal costs imposed by current immigration policy, as it states that it is as much as $300 billion annually. The expert's verdict mentions that this figure is based on one study and may be cherry-picking one result out of a larger report.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the $300 billion figure. The expert's verdict mentions that the economic impact of immigration is widely debated and that the $300 billion figure was highlighted by Trump's team based on a Washington Times story.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that low-skilled migrants create a net fiscal deficit and impose significant costs on U.S. taxpayers. The expert's verdict mentions that there is general agreement among immigration experts on this assumption, but it is still a matter of debate.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the costs imposed by immigrants are largely taken on by state and local governments that educate the immigrants' children. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the net fiscal costs attributed to immigration, such as the distribution of costs across different levels of government."}
