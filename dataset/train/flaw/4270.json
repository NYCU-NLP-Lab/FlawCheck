{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it describes the tradition as \"settling grudges with an annual tradition of fist fights,\" while the expert's verdict mentions that it is a festival where residents settle their differences with a public fist fight. The term \"grudges\" implies a more negative and long-standing conflict, which may not always be the case.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the existence of the tradition of Takanakuy in the Chumbivilcas Province of Peru. It would benefit from more supporting information or references to establish its credibility.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the purpose of Takanakuy is solely to settle grudges, while the expert's verdict mentions that it is also a pagan-religious festival and a way for participants to test their bravery, fitness, and courage. The claim's assumption oversimplifies the tradition and ignores its multifaceted nature.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not provide alternative explanations for the tradition or consider other possible reasons for the fist fights. It presents the tradition solely as a means to settle grudges, overlooking other cultural or social aspects that may contribute to its practice."}
