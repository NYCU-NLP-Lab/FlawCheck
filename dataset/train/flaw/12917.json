{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the photo shows a Burmese monk wearing high heels as part of a ritual to bring luck to Myanmar's ex-dictators is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the claim is false. The photo actually depicts a monk wearing high heels at a village funeral in Thailand.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence or credible sources provided to back up the assertion that the monk wore the high heels for the stated purpose.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the monk's action of wearing high heels is connected to a specific ritual aimed at bringing luck to ex-dictators. However, there is no evidence or information provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the monk wearing high heels is not related to any specific ritual or intention to bring luck to anyone, but rather a personal choice or a cultural practice that may have different interpretations.", "Exaggerate": "While the claim does not necessarily exaggerate the event itself, it does present a false narrative by misattributing the photo to a Burmese monk and associating it with a specific ritual that does not exist.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the provided claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times as it is consistently false throughout."}
