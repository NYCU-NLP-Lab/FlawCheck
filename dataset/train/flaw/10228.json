{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the video shows a plane crashing in Pakistan is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the crash actually happened in Afghanistan.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the video is \"disappearing from the Internet,\" when in fact it can easily be found online.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the assertion that the video is disappearing from the Internet.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video being \"disappearing from the Internet\" is indicative of a cover-up or scrubbing, which is a problematic assumption without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the video may not be widely available, such as copyright restrictions or limited distribution."}
