{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or references to support the assertion that two medical ethic codes give people the right to refuse vaccines in South Korea.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Hippocratic Oath and the Declaration of Geneva, which are codes of ethics for medical practitioners, grant individuals the right to refuse vaccines. However, these codes do not specifically mention vaccines, and they are not legally binding or applicable to a patient's rights.", "Understate": "The claim understates the context and complexity of the proposed Covid-19 vaccinations bill in South Korea. It mentions the exemption clause for people with \"special circumstances,\" but it fails to provide details on what qualifies as a special circumstance or how the exemption process would work.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the Hippocratic Oath and the Declaration of Geneva do not mention vaccines or grant individuals the right to refuse them."}
