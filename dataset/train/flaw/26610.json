{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of ballots that are \"highly likely\" to be ineligible in Fulton County, Georgia. The expert's verdict clarifies that the 132,000 flags indicating people had moved does not necessarily mean that those ballots were ineligible or would be disqualified.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence provided to substantiate the claim that 132,000 ballots are \"highly likely\" to be ineligible.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 132,000 flags indicating people had moved automatically translate to those ballots being ineligible, which is a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict clarifies that having a change of address flag does not mean someone voted illegally.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the 132,000 flags, stating that it indicates people who have reported a change of address but are still on the voter rolls, rather than indicating ineligible ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been no major news stories or public statements from election officials regarding a large number of ballots being disqualified in Fulton County.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by misinterpreting and taking out of context the statement made by Richard Baris, the director of Big Data Polling. The expert's verdict clarifies that Baris never said that 132,000 ballots were likely to be tossed out.", "Understate": "None evident in this case."}
