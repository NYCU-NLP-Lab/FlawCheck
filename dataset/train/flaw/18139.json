{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the defeat of the incumbent who broke the pledge by stating that they were \"defeated soundly,\" when in reality, they lost by a margin of about 3.8 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that the commitment to the pledge is taken very seriously by voters. It only provides one example of an incumbent being defeated for breaking the pledge.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the defeat of the incumbent was solely due to breaking the pledge and voting for the income tax hike, without considering other factors that may have influenced the election outcome.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the incumbent's defeat, such as the presence of a third-party candidate who received a surprising 10 percent of the votes."}
