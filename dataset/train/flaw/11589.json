{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the extent to which African-Americans are overrepresented on Florida's death row, as it fails to consider the larger number of white inmates on death row compared to black inmates.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the role of racial disparities in sentencing for death penalty cases, as there is research showing such disparities in Florida and across the country.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the overrepresentation of African-Americans on Florida's death row is solely due to racial bias, without considering alternative explanations such as differences in offending rates.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion of African-Americans being \"grossly overrepresented\" on Florida's death row.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the alternative explanation that the difference in the makeup of death row compared to the general population is attributable to differences in offending rates, rather than bias in the system.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that no white person has ever been executed for killing a black person in Florida.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a comprehensive analysis of the racial dynamics on Florida's death row, as it focuses primarily on the overrepresentation of African-Americans without considering other factors such as gender disparities."}
