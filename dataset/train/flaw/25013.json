{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of Heidi Heitkamp's support for sanctuary cities by implying that she supports releasing illegal immigrants who have committed crimes onto the streets, leading to sexual assault of children. The ad paints a misleading and exaggerated picture of her stance on immigration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that Heidi Heitkamp supports sanctuary cities and that this support led to the release of a criminal who sexually assaulted a child. The ad does not provide specific examples or data to support these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that supporting sanctuary cities automatically means supporting the release of criminals onto the streets, which is a problematic assumption. It fails to acknowledge that sanctuary cities have various policies and ordinances that limit assistance to federal immigration authorities, but not necessarily the release of criminals.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Heidi Heitkamp's stance on sanctuary cities. It fails to mention her reasons for voting against bills that would defund sanctuary cities, such as concerns about punishing law enforcement for political decisions made by municipalities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Heidi Heitkamp has voiced opposition to the movement to abolish ICE and has expressed support for increased penalties for unauthorized immigrants. The ad misrepresents her stance on immigration by suggesting she aligns with Washington liberals who want to abolish ICE.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement bias in the claim."}
