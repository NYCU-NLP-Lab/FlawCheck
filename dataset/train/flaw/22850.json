{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerated because it states that Russ Feingold \"voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times,\" which implies a consistent pattern of opposition to military authorization.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or specific examples to support the statement that Feingold voted against authorizing the military 11 times. The evidence provided only mentions Feingold voting against the National Defense Authorization Act, but it does not specify the other instances.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that voting against authorizing the military is inherently negative and implies that it makes America less safe. This assumption may be seen as problematic because it does not consider the potential reasons behind Feingold's votes or alternative approaches to national security.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not explore alternative explanations for Feingold's votes against authorizing the military. It only briefly mentions that he was sometimes joined by conservative Republicans in voting against the National Defense Authorization Act, suggesting that there may be differing perspectives on the issue."}
