{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that nearly half of all child deaths in Africa stem from hunger, which may not be fully supported by the evidence provided.", "Lack enough support": "The evidence provided in the expert's verdict suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient support for the claim. The research cited does not specifically focus on Africa and a calculation for the region had not been done.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that hunger is the primary cause of nearly half of all child deaths in Africa, without considering other contributing factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the term \"hunger\" is difficult to define universally and that the organization adopts a comprehensive understanding of child hunger, including malnutrition and undernutrition. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for child deaths in Africa, beyond hunger alone.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times as the evidence provided in the expert's verdict raises questions about the accuracy and specificity of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate the issue of child deaths in Africa stemming from hunger, as it presents a high percentage. However, it may understate the complexity of the issue by not considering other factors contributing to child mortality.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that child deaths in Africa are solely or primarily caused by hunger, as the evidence provided suggests a more comprehensive understanding of child hunger, including malnutrition and undernutrition."}
