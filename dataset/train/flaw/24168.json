{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the severity of the train crash by stating it as a \"big train accident\" when in reality it is footage from a 2016 train derailment.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the footage is not live and is instead from a previous incident.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that it is indeed live footage of a train crash in Bihar.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the viewers would interpret the footage as a recent train crash in Bihar, leading to a misleading understanding."}
