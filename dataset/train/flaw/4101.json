{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent to which the impeachment inquiry hearings are being conducted behind closed doors. The expert's verdict mentions that witnesses are being questioned in private and that initial interviews are done in secret, suggesting a greater level of secrecy than implied by the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or support to back up the assertion that the impeachment inquiry hearings are consistent with the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives. The expert's verdict provides some context and explanation, but there is no direct evidence cited to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the closed-door hearings and Congressman Schiff's role in presiding over them are consistent with the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives. However, the expert's verdict highlights that the rules and procedures for an impeachment are not explicitly defined in the Constitution or in a statute, but rather depend on historical precedent. Therefore, the claim may make a problematic assumption about the specific rules governing the impeachment inquiry hearings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why the impeachment inquiry hearings are being conducted behind closed doors, such as reasons related to national security or intelligence. The expert's verdict mentions that the House rules permit closed hearings on matters of national security or intelligence, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the closed-door nature of the hearings."}
