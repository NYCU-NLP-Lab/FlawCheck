{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the availability of health plans for $75 a month or less by stating that 8 in 10 people can find such plans. The expert's verdict suggests that this figure only applies to a specific subset of the population enrolled in HealthCare.gov.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support for the statement that 8 in 10 people can find plans for $75 a month or less. The expert's verdict highlights the limited scope of the statistic and the absence of statistics on HealthCare.gov visitors.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the statistic of 8 in 10 people finding affordable plans applies to the general population, which the expert's verdict suggests is not the case. The claim fails to consider alternative sources of healthcare coverage and the income eligibility for subsidies.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the statistic, such as the self-selecting nature of the HealthCare.gov population and the decline in participation as incomes increase and subsidy eligibility decreases. These alternative explanations challenge the claim's assertion that 8 in 10 people can find affordable plans."}
