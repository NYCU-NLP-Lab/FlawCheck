{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating Obama's promise by stating that he \"promised the nation\" to do health care reform focused on cost containment, opposed an individual mandate, and said he would do it with Republicans.

The expert's verdict provides the actual quote from Obama, which differs from the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Obama broke his promise by not doing health care reform focused on cost containment, opposing an individual mandate, and working with Republicans.

The expert's verdict offers an alternative explanation by providing Obama's actual quote, which emphasizes making health care affordable and available to every American by bringing Democrats and Republicans together.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Obama did not explicitly promise to do health care reform focused on cost containment, oppose an individual mandate, and work with Republicans on the night of the Iowa caucuses. The expert's verdict provides the actual quote from Obama, which differs from the claim.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim may be seen as faltering at times by misrepresenting Obama's promise on the night of the Iowa caucuses. The expert's verdict provides a more accurate representation of Obama's statement."}
