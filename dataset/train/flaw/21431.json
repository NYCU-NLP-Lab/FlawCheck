{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of mass shootings by only providing a specific number (251) without considering other criteria or definitions used to count them.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the stated number of 251 mass shootings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that there is a universally accepted definition of \"mass shooting,\" which is not the case. Different organizations and sources may have different criteria for counting mass shootings, leading to varying numbers.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations or factors that could influence the number of mass shootings, such as the inclusion or exclusion of certain types of incidents (e.g., gang-related or domestic violence) in the count.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no set definition for \"mass shooting,\" as mentioned by the expert's verdict. This contradicts the claim's assumption of a specific definition and the resulting number of incidents."}
