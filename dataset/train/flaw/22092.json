{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or data to support the statement that KSh1.57 trillion is equivalent to 20% of the total shareable revenue of 7.8 trillion shillings.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the total shareable revenue of 7.8 trillion shillings is accurate and that KSh1.57 trillion is indeed equivalent to 20% of it. However, without further evidence or verification, this assumption may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations or interpretations of the claim, such as different calculations or definitions of \"shareable revenue\" that could affect the validity of the 20% equivalence."}
