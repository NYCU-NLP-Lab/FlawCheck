{"Lack enough support": "The claim that the domain Itanimulli.com points to the website of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) is supported by the expert's verdict, which confirms that typing \"Itanimulli.com\" into a browser does redirect users to the NSA's website. However, no additional evidence or sources are provided to further support this claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that rumors about satanic, occult, or secret society messaging hidden in popular culture have circulated for decades. This suggests that there could be alternative explanations for the existence of the Itanimulli.com domain and its redirection to the NSA's website, such as it being a coincidence or a prank, rather than a deliberate connection to the Illuminati.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the connection between the Itanimulli.com domain and the NSA is significant and intentional, possibly implying a link between the Illuminati and the NSA. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is true in its basics, as typing \"Itanimulli.com\" into a browser does redirect users to the NSA's website. Therefore, there is no contradiction with this fact.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence in the expert's verdict to suggest that the claim falters at times or is inconsistent.", "Understate": "There is no evidence in the expert's verdict to suggest that the claim is understated or downplays the significance of the connection between the Itanimulli.com domain and the NSA.", "Exaggerate": "There is no evidence in the expert's verdict to suggest that the claim exaggerates the connection between the Itanimulli.com domain and the NSA."}
