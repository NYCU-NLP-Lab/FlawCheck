{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there is no federal law or proposed federal legislation prohibiting smoking in vehicles with children.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the law by stating that it is illegal to smoke in cars with children starting January 30, 2018, when in reality, it is a bill that still has additional legislative hurdles.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misleading viral story on Facebook and a blog that recycled a similar story from 2016.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the law applies nationwide, when in fact it refers to a specific state (Alabama) and is not yet state law.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim could have alternative explanations, such as confusion caused by the broad statements in the blog and the lack of clarification on the jurisdiction the law applies to."}
