{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of deaths caused by malaria in Nigeria. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim of 822 deaths per day would result in a total of 300,030 deaths per year, which is two-thirds more than the most recent official figures. This suggests that the actual number of malaria deaths in Nigeria may be higher than the claim implies.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support to substantiate the statement that malaria kills 822 people in Nigeria every day. The expert's verdict mentions that the most recent official figures do not align with this claim, indicating a lack of adequate evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of deaths from malaria in Nigeria has remained constant over time. However, the expert's verdict highlights that there has been a decline in malaria deaths in Nigeria in recent years. Therefore, the claim's assumption of a consistent daily death toll from malaria may be problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the claim. It mentions that the Nigerian presidential spokesman's claim of 822 malaria deaths per day was made in response to the media coverage of the novel coronavirus. This implies that the claim may have been made to divert attention or highlight another issue rather than providing an accurate representation of malaria deaths in Nigeria.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that the presidential spokesman's claim is false. This indicates that the claim does not align with the available facts and evidence regarding malaria deaths in Nigeria.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of deaths caused by malaria in Nigeria. The expert's verdict mentions that the claim of 822 deaths per day would result in a total of 300,030 deaths per year, which is significantly higher than the most recent official figures. This suggests that the claim may be an exaggeration of the actual number of malaria deaths in Nigeria.", "Falters at times": "It is difficult to determine if the claim falters at times based solely on the information provided. Further context or evidence would be needed to assess if the claim has inconsistencies or weaknesses in its argumentation."}
