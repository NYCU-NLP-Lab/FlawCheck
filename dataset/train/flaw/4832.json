{"Understate": "The claim states that only three countries in NATO spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Greece met this goal in 2013. This suggests that the claim may be understating the number of countries meeting the 2 percent threshold.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that only three countries in NATO meet the 2 percent defense spending goal. It would benefit from more supporting information to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 28 members of NATO have pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense, but it does not provide evidence or sources to support this assumption. There may be alternative explanations or factors influencing defense spending within NATO that are not addressed in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for why countries may not meet the 2 percent defense spending goal. There may be valid reasons or circumstances that prevent certain countries from reaching this target, such as economic constraints or differing national security priorities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Greece did meet the 2 percent defense spending goal in 2013, as stated in the expert's verdict. This suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate and may be exaggerating the number of countries meeting the goal.", "Exaggerate": "The claim states that only three countries in NATO meet the 2 percent defense spending goal, but the expert's verdict provides evidence that at least three countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and Greece) met this goal in 2013. This suggests that the claim may be exaggerating the lack of countries meeting the 2 percent threshold."}
