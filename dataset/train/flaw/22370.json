{"Exaggeration": "The claim states that TriMet spends \"$10.3 million in police contracts\" a year for 56 transit police who must respond to non-transit calls. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the actual number of officers is 62, not 56.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the transit police are rarely around or that their spending is squandered. It is based on the union's ad and their perception.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the transit police officers' primary duty is to respond to non-transit calls, without providing any evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the actual number of officers stated by TriMet, which is 62, not 56.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the actual amount spent on police security contracts. The expert's verdict mentions that the total cost is $10.7 million, which is higher than the $10.3 million mentioned in the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the spending on transit police contracts or the allocation of duties. It assumes that the spending is squandered without exploring other reasons or factors."}
