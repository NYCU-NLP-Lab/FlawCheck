{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the idea that Shaheen Bagh was completely empty after the AAP's win in the Delhi election. The provided evidence shows that the protesters were present, just not in large numbers at certain times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it relies on a single report and a misleading picture to make a broad statement about the absence of protesters.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of protesters is directly linked to the AAP's victory in the election, without providing concrete evidence or a clear causal relationship.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the absence of protesters, such as the timing of the picture and the fact that protesters may have arrived later in the day.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that protesters were present in Shaheen Bagh, as reported by multiple sources and eyewitness accounts."}
