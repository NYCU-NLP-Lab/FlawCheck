{"Exaggerate": "The claim of 27% of mail-in ballots not being delivered in South Florida is based on a misreading of USPS data and does not accurately reflect the actual situation.", "Lack enough support": "The 27% figure is derived from a tweet and a misinterpretation of USPS data, which does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the 27% figure represents undelivered ballots, when in fact, the postal service had stated that they did not scan ballots on their way out from the mail processing center to speed up the delivery process.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the statement from the election supervisor offices of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, which reported zero undelivered ballots.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The Vice News article and statements from the postal service and National Association of Letter Carriers provide alternative explanations for the lower processing score and the handling of ballots, suggesting that the situation is not as dire as the claim implies."}
