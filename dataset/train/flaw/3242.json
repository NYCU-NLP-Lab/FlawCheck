{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Sanjay Shinde as the \"main accused\" in the Palghar case without providing sufficient evidence or official confirmation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough supporting evidence or official confirmation to prove that Sanjay Shinde was indeed the main accused in the Palghar case.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video of Sanjay Shinde's car accident is proof of his involvement in the Palghar case, which is a problematic assumption as it lacks concrete evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for Sanjay Shinde's car accident, such as a short circuit, which contradicts the claim that it was a deliberate act related to the Palghar case."}
