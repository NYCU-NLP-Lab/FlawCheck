{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama\" may be seen as an exaggeration because it presents a large increase in the number of people living in poverty without providing a clear timeframe or context.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it only references an editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner and a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference, both of which do not provide a specific source for the poverty numbers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in the number of people living in poverty can be solely attributed to President Obama without considering other factors or policies that may have influenced the poverty rate.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may exist alternative explanations for the increase in the number of people living in poverty, such as economic factors or policies implemented by previous administrations that could have had a lingering effect during Obama's presidency."}
