{"Understates": "The claim states that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama, but the expert's verdict reveals that the actual amount attributed to unions was $300 million. Therefore, the claim understates the amount spent by unions.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is difficulty in independently confirming the exact amount of union spending during the 2008 cycle. The unions do not have to report all of their campaign spending to the Federal Election Commission, making it challenging to provide sufficient support for the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the $400 million spent by unions was solely for the purpose of electing Obama. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the $300 million attributed to unions was part of a larger fundraising goal by liberal groups, including non-union advocacy groups. Therefore, the claim makes a problematic assumption about the sole purpose of the spending.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the unions' spending largely benefited Democrats, with significant contributions going to Democratic candidates and parties. This alternative explanation suggests that the unions' spending may not have been solely focused on electing Obama, but rather supporting the Democratic Party as a whole."}
