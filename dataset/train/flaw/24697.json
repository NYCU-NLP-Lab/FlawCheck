{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of Sadhvi Pragya's acquittal by presenting it as a complete vindication, when in fact she is currently out on bail and the case could still be challenged in a higher court.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Sadhvi Pragya has been acquitted of terror charges.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an acquittal automatically means the person is innocent, without considering the possibility of alternative explanations or further legal proceedings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations for Sadhvi Pragya's acquittal, such as the court's decision being based on technicalities or insufficient evidence rather than her actual innocence."}
