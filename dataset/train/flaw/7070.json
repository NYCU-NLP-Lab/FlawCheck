{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of indictments under Republican presidents, particularly Donald Trump, by counting the number of criminal charges filed instead of the number of people indicted. It also includes indictments of people who are not part of the administration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the numbers of indictments mentioned.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of indictments is solely indicative of the administrations' wrongdoing or criminal activity, without considering other factors or alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim acknowledges that it is not always easy to identify which indictments can be connected to a presidential administration, as some may be related to private sector actions or presidential campaigns rather than direct administration involvement.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there have been more than just three indictments under recent Democratic presidents, as it only considers indictments directly tied to the presidents themselves and not their associates or other individuals involved.", "Understate": "The claim understates the number of indictments under recent Democratic presidents by only considering those directly tied to the presidents themselves and not including indictments of their associates or other individuals involved.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by using misleading or incomplete information, such as counting individual charges instead of indictments and including indictments of people not part of the administration."}
