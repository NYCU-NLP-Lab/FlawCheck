{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it states that Linda McMahon \"was caught tipping off a ringside physician\" about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers. The provided information does not explicitly state that McMahon was caught tipping off the physician, but rather mentions a memo she wrote that became part of the public record.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the accusation against Linda McMahon. It only mentions a memo she wrote, but does not provide further details or corroborating evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may involve a problematic assumption as it implies that McMahon's actions regarding the ringside physician and the federal investigation were unethical or inappropriate. However, without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the true nature of McMahon's actions or intentions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations as it mentions that the ringside physician, George T. Zahorian, was assigned to attend WWF exhibitions by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. This suggests that McMahon's communication about the investigation could have been related to fulfilling regulatory requirements rather than tipping off the physician about illegal activities.", "Contradict fact": "The claim may contradict the fact that McMahon was directly caught tipping off the ringside physician, as it only mentions a memo she wrote. The claim's wording implies a more direct involvement than what is presented in the information provided.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times, as there is limited information provided to assess the consistency or accuracy of the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not appear to understate any information or downplay the significance of the allegations against Linda McMahon."}
