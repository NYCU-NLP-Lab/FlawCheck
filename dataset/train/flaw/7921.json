{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the wives of the 9/11 hijackers knew what was happening and went back to Saudi Arabia to watch their husbands on television contradicts the findings of the 9/11 Commission report, which states that most of the hijackers had broken off regular contact with their families before the attacks.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that the wives knew about the attacks and went back to Saudi Arabia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the wives of the hijackers had knowledge of the impending attacks, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the wives of the hijackers had no knowledge of the attacks and were not involved in any way, as indicated by the findings of the 9/11 Commission report.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the involvement and knowledge of the wives by suggesting they watched their husbands on television flying the planes, which is not supported by evidence.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in its consistency, as it initially seems to refer to one wife but later includes all the planes involved in the attacks, creating confusion in the narrative.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim understates any aspect of the situation."}
