{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the decrease in job tenure over the last 20 years, as the expert's analysis shows that the median tenure has actually increased.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average worker stays at their job for barely four years, which may be a problematic assumption as it does not consider factors such as age or industry.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the statement about the average worker's job tenure.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the change in job tenure, such as shifts in the job market or changes in the economy, which are not addressed in the claim."}
