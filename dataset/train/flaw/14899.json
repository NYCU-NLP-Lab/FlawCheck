{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the role of Meg Whitman in starting a separate division that only sells porn. The expert's verdict clarifies that Whitman did not introduce the idea of selling adult material on eBay and that people were already auctioning adult products on the platform before she became CEO.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that starting a separate division for selling porn is inherently negative or problematic. However, the expert's verdict explains that Whitman created the \"adult only\" section to wall it off from children and that efforts were made to make it more difficult for kids to access.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that Whitman started a separate division solely for selling porn. The expert's verdict provides information that Whitman created the \"adult only\" section, but it does not specify that it was a separate division solely dedicated to selling porn.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the creation of the \"adult only\" section. The expert's verdict explains that Whitman created the section to separate adult material from other categories and to make it more difficult for children to access.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that people were already auctioning adult products on eBay before Whitman became CEO. The expert's verdict clarifies this point and states that Whitman did not introduce the idea of selling adult material on eBay.", "Falters at times": "It is unclear if the claim falters at times as the provided information does not explicitly mention any inconsistencies or contradictions in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim does not understate any information or downplay the significance of Whitman's role in relation to the adult section on eBay."}
