The expert's verdict explains that Cooper vetoed the proposals in hopes of negotiating higher raises for teachers.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Governor Cooper's vetoes of teacher pay raises are solely due to opposition to raises. The expert's verdict clarifies that Cooper vetoed the proposals because he believed they shortchanged teachers and prioritized corporate tax cuts.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the assertion that Governor Cooper has vetoed every single teacher pay raise passed by the legislature. The expert's verdict provides evidence that Cooper has only vetoed four opportunities for teacher pay raises.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for Governor Cooper's vetoes, such as his desire for higher raises for teachers. The expert's verdict highlights Cooper's intention to negotiate better pay for teachers through his vetoes."}
