{"Exaggerate": "The claim states that more currency, drugs, and outbound arms have been seized in the past year than in any year in the country's history. The expert's verdict provides data that shows an increase in seizures but does not confirm if it is the highest in history.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that they asked for more data from the Department of Homeland Security but did not receive it. This suggests that the claim may lack enough supporting evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in seizures is solely due to the efforts of the Obama administration. The expert's verdict mentions that cash seizures increased after the start of a program to boost seizures, indicating that other factors may have contributed to the increase.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that an estimated $18 billion to $39 billion is smuggled out of the southwest border each year, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the increase in seizures, such as increased smuggling activity rather than improved border security efforts."}
