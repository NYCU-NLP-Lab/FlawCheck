{"Exaggerate": "The claim may have exaggerated the situation by stating that the CVS store demanded immigration papers, while the expert's verdict suggests that it was a misunderstanding stemming from the employee's initial mistake.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the refusal of the Puerto Rican driver's license was due to discrimination or bias, without considering the possibility of a genuine misunderstanding by the employee.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or support to prove that the refusal of the driver's license was a deliberate act of discrimination.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the incident may have been the result of a misunderstanding rather than intentional bias or discrimination.", "Understate": "The claim may have understated the fact that CVS apologized and took responsibility for the employee's mistake, as well as their commitment to remind employees about valid forms of identification.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and its residents are American citizens, which was acknowledged by CVS in their apology.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive understanding of the incident, including the employee's initial mistake and the subsequent actions taken by CVS."}
