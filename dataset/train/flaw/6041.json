{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the difference in tax rates between taxpayers earning $1 million and $100,000. While the effective tax rate for those earning $1 million is indeed higher, it is not necessarily four times higher as stated in the claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the comparison between the tax rates of taxpayers earning $1 million and $100,000. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the tax system or the factors influencing tax rates.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the current tax rates and the difference in effective tax rates between different income levels are fair. However, fairness is subjective, and different individuals may have different perspectives on what constitutes a fair tax system.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the difference in effective tax rates. It does not explore factors such as deductions, exemptions, or other tax policies that may contribute to the disparity in tax burdens between different income levels.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter in accurately representing the complexity of the tax system and the factors influencing tax rates. It simplifies the comparison between taxpayers earning $1 million and $100,000 without considering the nuances and intricacies involved.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential impact of increasing income taxes on high earners. It briefly mentions that it could drive people out of the state or discourage them from moving to New Jersey, but does not provide further analysis or evidence to support this assertion.", "Contradict fact": "The claim does not appear to contradict any specific factual information provided in the expert's verdict. However, it may be subject to interpretation and different perspectives on what constitutes a fair tax rate."}
