{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Bernie Sanders has never voted yes on sanctions against Russia contradicts the fact that he voted in favor of sanctions against Russia in 2017 as an amendment to a larger bill.", "Understate": "The claim understates Sanders' support for the expansion of the Magnitsky Act, which imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it fails to provide evidence for its assertion that Sanders has never voted yes on sanctions against Russia.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Sanders' connection with Russia, including his honeymooning in the Soviet Union and receiving love from Russia for his presidential bids, is evidence of his lack of support for sanctions against Russia. However, this connection does not necessarily imply his voting record on sanctions.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for Sanders' votes on sanctions, such as the claim that he voted against the Magnitsky Act due to a free trade provision tucked into the legislative package.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times by not acknowledging Sanders' mixed voting history on sanctions, including voting yes on an amendment to a bill adding Russia to sanctions against Iran, but voting no on the overall legislation that included sanctions on Russia."}
