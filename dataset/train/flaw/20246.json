{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the cost of the pens by stating that Nancy Pelosi spent $2500.00 per pen, when in reality the suggested retail value is about $20.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Nancy Pelosi spent $2500.00 per pen.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the cost of the pens directly reflects Nancy Pelosi's personal expenditure, without considering other factors such as discounts or third-party distributors.", "Understate": "The claim understates the actual cost of the pens by stating that they are made mostly of brass and have a suggested retail value of about $20, when in fact they are made of brass with a thin plating that includes some gold.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider the possibility that other individuals or organizations, such as the White House, have also used similar pens in the past."}
