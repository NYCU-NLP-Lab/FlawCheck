{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the Minions in the film \"Despicable Me\" were inspired by photographs of young Nazi poison gas test subjects contradicts the fact that the photograph actually depicts the Hall and Rees Submarine escape apparatus.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the Minions and Nazi gas experiments by stating that the Jewish children adopted by Nazi scientists were used to experiment with the same gas component used in gas chambers.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a misinterpretation of a photograph and there is no evidence or credible sources provided to back up the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the Minions were directly inspired by photographs of young Nazi poison gas test subjects, without considering other possible inspirations or influences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the Minions were not inspired by Nazi gas test subjects, but rather by the Hall and Rees Submarine escape apparatus depicted in the photograph."}
