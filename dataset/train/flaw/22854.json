{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates Mitt Romney's position on abortion by stating that he \"backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.\" The expert's verdict mentions that there is a problem in extrapolating Romney's position from his support for the Republican platform and the human life amendment.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no specific bill or language to support the claim that Romney backed a bill outlawing all abortions.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Romney's support for the human life amendment means he opposes abortion in cases of rape and incest, but the expert's verdict states that support for the amendment does not necessarily equate to opposing abortion in those cases.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for Romney's position on abortion, indicating that the claim may not fully consider all perspectives or factors."}
