{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the stance of both Biden and Trump on mandating the COVID-19 vaccine. While the claim suggests that Biden will definitely mandate the vaccine and Trump will never mandate it, the expert's verdict provides more nuanced information about Biden's stance, indicating that it would depend on the advice of experts and the efficacy of the vaccine.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understatement in the claim.", "Falters at times": "There is no evidence of the claim faltering at times.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Biden will mandate the COVID-19 vaccine and Trump will not, without providing sufficient evidence or sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is no evidence of an alternative explanation being presented in the claim."}
