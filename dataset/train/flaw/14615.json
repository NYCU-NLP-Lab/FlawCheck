{"Understate": "The claim states that 40% of illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas, but reports have estimated a range of 27% to 58%. This suggests that the claim may be understating the actual percentage.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is not supported by sufficient evidence or data. The expert mentions that the statistics on visa overstays have not been updated since a 1996 study, and subsequent estimates have been based on adapting that old data to current trends. This lack of updated and comprehensive data undermines the claim's support.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert mentions that building a wall on the Mexican border is not the only solution to prevent illegal immigration. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations or factors contributing to illegal immigration, which the claim does not consider."}
