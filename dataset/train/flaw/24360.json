{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the consequences of not using the COVID-19 contact tracing app by stating that New Zealanders will be banned from entering and purchasing from businesses.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove its validity. The provided information does not present any official government statements or sources confirming the ban on entering or purchasing from businesses for those not using the app.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the contact tracing app mentioned (EVA Check-in) is the same as the government's official NZ COVID Tracer app. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that they are separate systems and EVA Check-in is not a contact-tracing app.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the measures mentioned. The expert's verdict explains that the EVA Check-in system is not mandatory or government-related, but rather a commercial system that businesses can choose to use for guest registration.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that retailers do not need to record customer details, as clarified by the government's statement mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
