{"Exaggeration": "The claim exaggerates the extent of the raises given by Jon Corzine, stating that he \"gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years.\" The expert's verdict clarifies that the contracts included a number of union concessions, which undermines the claim of excessive raises.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that Jon Corzine gave away significant raises. The expert's verdict provides more context and information to support a different interpretation of the events.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that giving raises to public-sector unions is inherently negative or problematic. The expert's verdict points out that the contracts included concessions and that the raises were part of a negotiation process.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim presents a one-sided view of the events and fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the raises and Corzine's actions. The expert's verdict provides additional information and context that challenges the claim's narrative."}
