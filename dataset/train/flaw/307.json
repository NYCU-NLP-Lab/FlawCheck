{"Exaggerate": "The claim of \"One-hundred times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class\" is an exaggeration, as the actual number is 22 times more under Clinton's presidency compared to Reagan's.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as the actual data shows a difference of 22 times, not 100 times.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the number of people moving from poverty to the middle class is the only measure of success, ignoring other factors.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim cherry-picks data by comparing election years for Clinton and Reagan, rather than the years they took office and left office, which may provide a different perspective."}
