{"Lack enough support": "The claim that consuming an orange flamb\u00e9ed in brown sugar will restore a person's loss of smell following COVID-19 infection lacks scientific evidence or research to support it.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that eating a specific type of orange prepared in a specific way can restore the loss of smell caused by COVID-19, without providing any scientific basis for this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The expert's verdict contradicts the claim by stating that there is no evidence to suggest that eating any style of orange will restore a person's loss of smell or taste due to COVID-19.", "Understate": "It can be argued that the expert's verdict may understate the potential harm of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 treatments, as it can lead to false hope and potentially dangerous actions.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by presenting anecdotal evidence from two individuals who claimed to have regained their sense of smell after eating the orange, without considering other factors or potential alternative explanations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are alternative explanations for the loss of smell due to COVID-19 that are not addressed in the claim, indicating the presence of alternative explanations bias."}
