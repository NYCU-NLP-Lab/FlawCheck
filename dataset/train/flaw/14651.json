{"Exaggerate": "The claim by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that Texas is responsible for the \"vast majority\" of San Francisco's homeless population is considered an exaggeration. The expert's verdict states that this claim is \"ridiculously false\" and lacks enough support.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that San Francisco's own point-in-time homeless counts consistently show that a large majority of people surveyed said they lived in San Francisco prior to becoming homeless.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the \"vast majority\" of San Francisco's homeless people come from Texas without providing sufficient evidence or supporting data.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that Newsom's claim lacks enough support and is contradicted by the point-in-time homeless counts conducted in San Francisco.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there are many reasons for San Francisco's homelessness crisis, such as gentrification, job losses, evictions, mental health, and substance abuse struggles. This implies that there are alternative explanations for the homelessness issue in the city, rather than solely attributing it to Texas."}
