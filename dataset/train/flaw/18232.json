{"Understate": "The claim may be understating the complexity and challenges involved in testing capacity, as there are various factors and processes involved in conducting tests.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by oversimplifying the testing process and not fully acknowledging the limitations and constraints that impact testing capacity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support as it does not provide sufficient evidence or data to back up the assertion that only 20% of testing capacity is being used.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the state could conduct five times more tests if it chose to, without considering the logistical and resource constraints involved.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the lower utilization of testing capacity, such as limitations in collection materials and infrastructure, which are mentioned in the expert's verdict."}
