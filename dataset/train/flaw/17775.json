{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or explanation for how the reaction allegedly occurred.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that immersing an egg in soda for 24 hours will dissolve its shell and turn it into a rubbery, squeezable substance.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert suggests that the video may have employed trickery, such as using a fake egg or a squishy egg-stress ball toy, to create the illusion of the reaction.", "Contradict fact": "The video's claim of dissolving an eggshell in soda is contradicted by the expert's explanation that vinegar is the substance that can dissolve an eggshell.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the amount of time needed for the reaction to occur, as the video cuts down a 24-hour time span to just a few seconds, potentially misleading viewers.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of soda on an egg by suggesting it can completely dissolve the shell and turn the egg into a rubbery, squeezable substance, which is not supported by the expert's explanation of the vinegar reaction.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and accurate representation of the reaction, as the video hides the egg from view and manipulates the time frame, making it difficult to determine what truly happens."}
