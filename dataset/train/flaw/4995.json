{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video shows an actual volcanic eruption in White Island, New Zealand, when in reality it is a simulation video from the Auckland War Memorial Museum.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the nature of the video, presenting it as a live volcanic eruption, when it is actually a simulation.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove its authenticity, as the video was taken from a simulation shown at a museum.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is a real volcanic eruption without verifying its source or authenticity.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider the alternative explanation that the video is not a genuine eruption, but a simulation created for educational purposes at the Auckland Museum."}
