{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of Bruce Rauner's actions by stating that Illinois went 736 days without a budget, delaying funding for schools, while local governments were forced to raise property taxes. The expert's verdict clarifies that a budgetary oasis for school funding was carved out during the budget standoff, and multi-billion dollar appropriations for K-12 education became law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bruce Rauner is solely responsible for the budget crisis and assigns unilateral blame to him. The expert's verdict highlights the squabbles between Rauner and Democrats in the legislature as a contributing factor to the crisis.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support for the statement that local governments were forced to raise property taxes due to the budget crisis. The expert's verdict mentions that local property tax levies are routinely raised by many local school boards to make ends meet, but it does not directly link it to the budget crisis.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by mentioning the upside-down nature of school funding in Illinois, where local property tax revenues play a significant role. This suggests that property tax hikes may not be solely attributed to the budget crisis but could be a result of the existing funding structure.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that multi-billion dollar appropriations for K-12 education became law during the budget standoff, indicating that school funding was not entirely jeopardized as stated in the claim.", "Understate": "The claim understates the efforts made to fund schools during the budget crisis by not acknowledging the budgetary oasis created for school funding and the passage of appropriations for K-12 education."}
