{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent to which the price of soybeans has fallen, stating it has fallen 50% since 5 years before the election.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that bad trade deals with other countries are a big reason for the decline in soybean prices.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that bad trade deals with other countries are the primary cause of the decline in soybean prices, without considering other factors that may have contributed.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to acknowledge alternative explanations for the decline in soybean prices, such as changes in global demand or supply factors.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that farmers have not done poorly for 15 years, as there was a period of strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports between 2011 and 2014.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity of the factors influencing soybean prices by attributing the decline solely to bad trade deals."}
