{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of undocumented immigrants who are beneficiaries of the food stamp program. The expert's verdict states that the claim is mathematically impossible, even if every single undocumented immigrant somehow managed to use the program.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the food stamp program is not open to undocumented immigrants. The expert's verdict explains that only U.S. citizens or eligible, lawfully-present non-citizens can qualify for SNAP benefits.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support or evidence to back up the assertion that 43% of all food stamp beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants. The expert's verdict provides data and information that disproves this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that a significant percentage of food stamp beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants without providing sufficient evidence or justification for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the presence of non-legal residents in families receiving food stamps, such as children who have citizenship because they were born in the U.S. It suggests that it is often an adult who is not a legal resident who submits the application."}
