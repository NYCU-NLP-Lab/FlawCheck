{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on 82% of all Americans, when in reality his tax plan does not call for direct tax increases on anyone earning below $400,000 per year.", "Understate": "The claim understates the indirect effects of Biden's tax plan, which could result in slightly lower after-tax incomes for some lower earners.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up the statement that Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on 82% of all Americans.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that \"raise taxes\" means new direct taxes on all Americans, when in fact it refers to the indirect effects felt in the form of lower investment returns or wages.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the indirect effects of Biden's tax plan, such as the impact on corporations and the nation's highest earners."}
