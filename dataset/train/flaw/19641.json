{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Saddam Hussein had designs on reviving his nuclear program is not supported by the Iraq Study Group's report, which focused on the future of Iraq and did not address this specific issue.", "Problematic assumption": "Fred Thompson's statement assumes that the Iraq Study Group reported that Saddam Hussein had designs on reviving his nuclear program, but there is no evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "It is possible that Thompson was referring to the Iraq Survey Group, which found that Saddam Hussein aspired to develop a nuclear capability, but did not possess any weapons of mass destruction at the time of the U.S.-led invasion."}
