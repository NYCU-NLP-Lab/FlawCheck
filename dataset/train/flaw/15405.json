{"Understate": "The claim may understate the context and complexity of Joe Biden's views on women working outside the home, as it only focuses on one op-ed from 1981 without considering his broader stance on the issue.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or sources to support the assertion that Joe Biden believed women working outside the home would deteriorate the family. It only mentions a single op-ed without providing any additional context or evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Joe Biden's views expressed in a 1981 op-ed still reflect his current beliefs and policies, without considering any potential changes or evolution of his stance over time.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations or interpretations of the 1981 op-ed that are not presented in the claim. The claim does not explore any other possible reasons or contexts for Biden's statements in the op-ed.", "Contradict fact": "It is unclear whether the claim contradicts any specific facts, as it is focused on a historical statement made by Joe Biden. However, without additional evidence or context, it is difficult to determine if the claim contradicts any established facts."}
