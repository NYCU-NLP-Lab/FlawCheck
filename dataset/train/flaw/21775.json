{"Understate": "The claim understates the actual impact of the law by suggesting that it explicitly bans non-Christians from adopting children, while the expert's verdict clarifies that it does not explicitly ban non-Christians.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the law passed in Texas would ban non-Christians from adopting children, but the expert's verdict highlights that the law allows faith-based adoption agencies to use religious beliefs as part of their criteria for child placement.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that non-Christians would be banned from adopting children.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the law does not discriminate against non-Christians and allows agencies to consider factors such as religious beliefs in the adoption process."}
