{"Understate": "The claim may understate the number of teenage girls who die in childbirth compared to those who finish high school. The expert's analysis suggests that the number of deaths could be much higher than what is reported.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient data and evidence to support the statement that more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school. The expert mentions the difficulty of obtaining accurate data in a war zone, indicating a lack of comprehensive information.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a direct causal relationship between the low completion rate of high school and the high rate of teenage girls dying in childbirth. It does not consider other factors that may contribute to these outcomes.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the high maternal mortality rate in South Sudan, such as limited access to healthcare facilities, lack of skilled birth attendants, or inadequate healthcare infrastructure. The claim does not explore these alternative explanations."}
