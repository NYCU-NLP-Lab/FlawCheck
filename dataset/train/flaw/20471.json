{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the statement made by Ted Strickland by implying that he called his own record on taxes and jobs \"mixed and spotty.\" However, the quote provided by the ad is taken out of context and was actually referring to his position on gun control.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the quote from Ted Strickland was not related to taxes and jobs, as the ad suggests.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to prove that Ted Strickland's record on taxes and jobs was actually \"mixed and spotty.\" The ad only mentions job losses and tax increases without providing sufficient evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that Ted Strickland's changing stance on gun control reflects negatively on his overall record as Ohio governor. However, this is a subjective assumption and may not necessarily be true.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation for Ted Strickland's changing stance on gun control is provided, stating that it was influenced by the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. This alternative explanation challenges the ad's portrayal of Strickland's record."}
