{"Understate": "The expert's verdict may understate the seriousness of the incident by stating that the police do not believe the restaurant intentionally tried to harm the officer. This suggests that the incident may not be as severe as it initially appears.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict lacks enough support to conclusively determine whether the incident was intentional or not. The information provided only includes the police department's statement and the presence of glass plates with chips, but there is no concrete evidence to support either claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that viewers assumed the adulteration was a deliberate attempt to harm the officer. This implies that there was a problematic assumption made by the viewers without sufficient evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The presence of glass plates with chipped rims and broken glass pieces under the drying rack suggests that there could be an alternative explanation for how the glass shards ended up in the officer's sandwich. This alternative explanation is not explored in the expert's verdict."}
