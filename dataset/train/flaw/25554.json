{"Understates": "The claim underestimates the number of years since a president or vice president or a member of their family has not attended an event at the Olympics. The expert's verdict provides examples of previous Olympics where family members represented the White House, which contradicts the claim that it has been 14 years since this has happened.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or examples to support the assertion that it has been 14 years since a president or vice president or a member of their family has not attended an event at the Olympics. The expert's verdict provides counterexamples that contradict this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the absence of a president, vice president, or their family members at the Olympics indicates a strained relationship between Russia and the United States. However, the expert's verdict suggests that the delegation selection may have been based on other factors such as the representation of diverse American values and scheduling conflicts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests an alternative explanation for the absence of a president, vice president, or their family members at the Olympics, such as scheduling conflicts or the inclusion of diverse representatives to reflect American values. This alternative explanation contradicts the claim that the absence is solely due to strained relations between Russia and the United States."}
