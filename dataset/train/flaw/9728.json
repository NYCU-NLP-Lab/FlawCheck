{"Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict does not provide specific evidence or data to support the claim that the video shows \"real robots\" dancing. It only mentions that the video was posted by Boston Dynamics, a reputable robotics company, but does not provide any further information or verification.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict assumes that the dancing robots in the video are real without providing any additional proof or clarification. It does not address the possibility of computer-generated imagery or any other alternative explanation.", "Exist alternative explanation": "Although the expert's verdict states that the robots in the video are not computer-generated, it does not provide any further explanation or evidence to rule out other possible explanations for the dancing robots."}
