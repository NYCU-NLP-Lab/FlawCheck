{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the actions of the West Bengal police by stating that they \"threw bombs\" at the BJP rally. The provided information mentions the use of tear gas shells and smoke bombs by the police, but there is no clear evidence of them throwing actual explosives.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of the claim understating any information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the West Bengal police threw bombs at the BJP rally. The information provided only mentions the use of tear gas shells, water cannons, and smoke bombs by the police.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video shared by BJP members and supporters shows the police throwing bombs at the protesters. However, the video does not clearly show the police throwing bombs, and there is no independent verification of the claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the police used non-lethal methods, such as tear gas and smoke bombs, to disperse the crowd after barricades were breached and stones were hurled.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the BJP has denied the reports of crude bombs being hurled at policemen."}
