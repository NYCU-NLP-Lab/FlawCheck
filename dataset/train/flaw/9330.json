{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of ballots being sent out by stating that \"80 million ballots\" are being sent all over the country, without specifying that these are mail-in ballots.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that all 80 million ballots are \"unsolicited\" and not requested by voters, without providing evidence to support this assumption.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that all 80 million ballots are non-requested or unsolicited.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the mailing of ballots, such as states that have routinely held all-mail elections or voters who have already taken action to request mail-in ballots.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that millions of voters have automatically received ballots in some states for many years without leading to widespread fraud, which undermines the claim's argument against mail-in ballots."}
