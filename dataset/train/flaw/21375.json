{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the idea that a handful of 1970s quarters minted on the back of a 1941 Canadian coin are worth a fortune. The only evidence provided is an eBay listing for one such coin priced at $35,000.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the value of a handful of 1970s quarters is directly correlated to the fact that they were minted on the back of a 1941 Canadian coin. However, no evidence or reasoning is provided to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert notes that many people are skeptical about the eBay listing and question why a 1970 United States quarter would be minted on the same coin as a 1941 Canada quarter. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the existence of these coins, such as mint errors or counterfeiting.", "Understate": "The claim may be understating the rarity and value of these coins by using the phrase \"a fortune\" without providing any specific information or comparison to other valuable coins. The expert's verdict mentions that the chances of finding these coins are practically nonexistent, indicating that they may be even rarer and more valuable than implied by the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing a clear and well-supported argument for the value of these coins. It relies heavily on the eBay listing and does not provide additional evidence or expert opinions to back up the claim.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the potential value of these coins by stating that they could be worth a yearly salary. While the expert's verdict mentions the $35,000 listing, it does not provide any information on the average or typical value of these coins.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim or the expert's verdict."}
