{"Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Department of Energy's \"Billion Ton Study\" supports the statement that wind and solar energy combined could only provide 5 percent of total energy needs. However, the expert's investigation found that the study does not mention this claim and focuses on biomass instead.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the assertion that wind and solar energy can only provide 5 percent of total energy needs. The expert's investigation found that the claim is not supported by the \"Billion Ton Study\" or other federal studies.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that wind and solar energy have the potential for greater contribution to the energy needs of the United States. The expert's investigation found that under current government energy policies, wind and solar combined are projected to account for 4 percent of electricity consumption and 2 percent of total energy consumption by 2035.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential of wind and solar energy by suggesting that they can only provide 5 percent of total energy needs. The expert's investigation found that the claim does not consider the potential of these technologies at their best.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the limited contribution of wind and solar energy, such as current government energy policies. The expert's investigation found that the projections for wind and solar energy are based on existing policies and may change if policies are altered.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on the incorrect interpretation of the \"Billion Ton Study\" to support the assertion about wind and solar energy. The expert's investigation found that the study does not support the claim made by the author."}
