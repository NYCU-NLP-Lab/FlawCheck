{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the increase in annual precipitation by stating that it has increased \"over 12 inches\" in the last century, while the expert's verdict mentions an increase of nearly one foot (which is equivalent to 12 inches).", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient support as it does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the increase in annual precipitation is solely due to global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, without considering other factors that may contribute to the change in precipitation patterns.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times in terms of providing accurate and up-to-date data, as the expert's verdict mentions that the data provided are eight years old.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the increase in annual precipitation, such as natural climate variability or other local factors that may influence precipitation patterns."}
