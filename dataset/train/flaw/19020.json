{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or supporting information to confirm that the ICE Twitter account was actually removed from the social network. The expert's verdict mentions that journalists on Twitter noticed the account had ceased to exist and that they found it appeared to have been removed for a few hours, but there is no concrete evidence provided to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the removal of the ICE Twitter account was intentional or due to external factors. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any conclusive information about the reason for the account's disappearance. It mentions that the agency offered no immediate reason, and there is speculation online about why it happened.", "Contradict fact": "The claim states that the ICE Twitter account appeared to have been briefly removed from the social network. However, the expert's verdict mentions that the account had returned to its fully functional state a few hours after it was first noticed. This contradicts the claim that it was removed.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be considered exaggerated as it implies that the ICE Twitter account was removed, which suggests a more significant action than what the expert's verdict describes. The verdict mentions that the account appeared to have been removed for a few hours but does not provide any further details or implications of this action.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating bias in the provided claim or expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The expert's verdict does not consistently provide clear and concise information about the incident. It includes additional information about the ICE Facebook page and the agency changing its own birthdate for the account. While these details may be relevant, they can also cause the verdict to falter at times by diverting attention from the main claim.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict does not explore or present any alternative explanations for the disappearance of the ICE Twitter account. It mainly focuses on the observation of the disappearance and the lack of immediate reasons provided by the agency."}
