{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific evidence or data to support the statement that \"twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants\" and that there are \"104 nuclear power plants in the United States, two of them around the coast in California.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the damage to Japanese nuclear facilities in 2011 would have a significant impact on the use of nuclear power in the United States. This assumption may not be well-supported or universally accepted.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the potential risks and concerns associated with nuclear power by emphasizing the resilience of nuclear plants to damage and downplaying the potential negative consequences.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim suggests that the damage to Japanese nuclear facilities was primarily caused by a tsunami, implying that a similar event would be unlikely to occur near the coast of California. However, there could be alternative explanations or factors that contributed to the damage in Japan.", "Falters at times": "The claim's wording and structure seem to be uncertain and speculative, with phrases such as \"I think\" and \"it sounds like.\" This indicates that the claim may not be entirely confident or consistent in its presentation of information.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of facts in the claim, as the provided information aligns with the statistics from the Statistical Abstract of the United States and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."}
