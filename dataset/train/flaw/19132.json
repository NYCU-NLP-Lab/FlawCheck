{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the flat tax by stating that it \"cut income taxes by 30 percent.\" The expert's verdict mentions that the new system had a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, but it is not explicitly stated if this resulted in a 30 percent reduction in income taxes for all taxpayers.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's verdict mentions that the research arm of the Utah Legislature maintains that the new tax system is not a \"flat\" income tax system in the purest sense. This suggests that there may be a lack of sufficient support for considering it a true flat tax.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the creation of a flat tax and the reduction of income taxes by 30 percent were the primary factors that led to the state coming to life. However, there may be alternative explanations or other factors that contributed to the state's growth.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Republicans often talk about supporting a flat tax but face difficulty in getting political support to change tax laws. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations for why a flat tax was achieved in Utah, such as political factors or specific circumstances unique to the state."}
