{"Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that the same crying woman appears in photos taken at multiple massacre scenes. This lack of supporting evidence weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the presence of the same crying woman in multiple photos indicates a conspiracy or staged event. This assumption may be problematic as it does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the same person in different photos, such as coincidences or the possibility of individuals attending multiple events.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the presence of the same woman in different photos. It immediately jumps to the conclusion of a conspiracy or staged event without exploring other possibilities.", "Exaggerate": "The claim lists several high-profile massacre scenes, including Sandy Hook, Aurora, Boston, Oregon, Paris, and Manchester, and asserts that the same woman appears in photos taken at all of these scenes. This broad assertion may be an exaggeration, as it is unlikely that the same woman would be present at all of these different events."}
