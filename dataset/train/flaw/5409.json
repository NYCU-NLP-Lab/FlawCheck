{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the connection between the deer's tumors and Monsanto's Roundup, as the tumors are actually caused by a viral infection transmitted through biting insects or direct contact, not herbicide.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the deer's tumors were caused by Roundup.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the deer's tumors are directly linked to the use of Monsanto's Roundup without considering alternative explanations or evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the cause of the deer's tumors, which is a viral infection transmitted through biting insects or direct contact, rather than herbicide exposure."}
