{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the impact of Rhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo's actions by stating that she \"raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87.\" The expert's verdict questions the accuracy of this statement and suggests that the life expectancy issue is being misrepresented.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to substantiate the assertion that Gina Raimondo used a 1994 annuity chart to create the pension crisis. The expert's verdict raises questions about the validity of this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Gina Raimondo's actions directly caused the pension crisis without considering alternative explanations or factors. The expert's verdict highlights the need for further investigation and raises questions about the decisions made by Raimondo.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that there may be alternative explanations for the pension crisis, such as the scaling back of the predicted expected rate of return on the state pension fund's investments. This indicates that the claim may not consider all possible factors contributing to the issue.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the federal government pegs the life expectancy at 78 for Rhode Islanders, while the claim states that Raimondo raised it to 87. The expert's verdict questions the accuracy of this claim and highlights the discrepancy between the two figures.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement in the claim or the expert's verdict.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by making unsupported assertions and not providing enough evidence to back them up. The expert's verdict points out the need for further investigation and raises questions about the accuracy of the claim."}
