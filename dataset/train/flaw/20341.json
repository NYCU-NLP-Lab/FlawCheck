{"Exaggerate": "The claim that Scott Walker \"cut $800 million from our schools\" may be seen as an exaggeration because it does not provide a clear timeline or context for the funding reduction. The actual reduction in school aid was $784.1 million over a two-year budget period, which is slightly lower than the claimed amount.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support because it does not provide specific evidence or sources to back up the assertion that Scott Walker personally cut the funding from schools. It relies on a general statement without providing detailed information or data.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that any reduction in school funding is detrimental and has a negative impact. However, it does not consider other factors or alternative explanations for the funding changes, such as budget constraints or shifts in priorities.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the reduction in school funding, such as Act 10, which required public employees to contribute more to their pensions and health insurance. This legislation may have contributed to the budgetary constraints that led to the reduction in school aid.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it does not provide a clear and consistent narrative or explanation for the funding reduction. It relies on general statements and does not address the complexities or nuances of the issue.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact of the funding reduction by not fully acknowledging that much of the funding has been restored since then. While the reduction did occur, it is important to consider the overall funding picture and any subsequent changes.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the actual reduction in school aid was $784.1 million, not $800 million as stated. This inconsistency undermines the accuracy of the claim."}
