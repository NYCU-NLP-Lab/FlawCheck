{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be seen as exaggerating the statement made by Yogi Adityanath by stating that he said \"dead bodies of Muslim women should be raped.\" The expert's verdict provides evidence that the statement made by Abhishek Banerjee alleges that Adityanath spoke of raping Muslim women, but it does not provide direct evidence of the exact words used by Adityanath.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide direct evidence or a verifiable source for the statement attributed to Yogi Adityanath. The expert's verdict mentions that a video featuring Abhishek Banerjee has been trending on social media, but it does not provide a direct source or evidence of the statement made by Adityanath.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Yogi Adityanath made the statement about raping Muslim women based on the allegations made by Abhishek Banerjee. However, the expert's verdict does not provide concrete evidence or a verifiable source for this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Adityanath's name is frequently associated with the offensive statement, but it does not provide alternative explanations or perspectives for this association."}
