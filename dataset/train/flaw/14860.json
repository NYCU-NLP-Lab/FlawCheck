{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of rape cases committed by Muslim perpetrators in India, stating it is 95% when there is no reference to religion as a category for recording crime in the NCRB report.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the specific percentages and numbers provided.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that an increase in the Muslim population will directly lead to an increase in the number of rapes, which is a problematic assumption without proper evidence or causation.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the NCRB report does not include religion as a category for recording crime, making it impossible to determine the religious affiliation of perpetrators.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the high number of rape cases, such as socio-economic factors, cultural issues, or other demographic factors."}
