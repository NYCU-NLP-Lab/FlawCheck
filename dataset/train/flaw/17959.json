{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Pakistani national flag was painted over the rooftop of Gurudwara Darbar Sahib. The expert's verdict provides evidence that the images circulating on social media are of the immigration center at the Kartarpur border, not the gurudwara itself.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Pakistani national flag being painted on the rooftop of Gurudwara Darbar Sahib is inappropriate and should be replaced with a Khanda flag. However, the expert's verdict does not provide any evidence or explanation as to why this assumption is problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the images, stating that they are of the immigration center at the Kartarpur border, not the gurudwara itself. This suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the presence of the Pakistani national flag.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the images circulating on social media are not of Gurudwara Darbar Sahib, but of the immigration center at the Kartarpur border.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the significance of the presence of the Pakistani national flag on the rooftop of Gurudwara Darbar Sahib, as it assumes that it is inappropriate and should be replaced with a Khanda flag.", "Understate": "There is no evidence to suggest that the claim is understating any aspect of the situation.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing sufficient evidence or considering alternative explanations for the presence of the Pakistani national flag on the rooftop."}
