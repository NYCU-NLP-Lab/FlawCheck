{"Contradict fact": "The claim that Thuli Madonsela posed with F.W. de Klerk in an apartheid-era flag dress is contradicted by the fact that the image has been doctored and the original photo was taken at a different event with a different theme.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by suggesting that Madonsela is embracing the apartheid legacy, when in fact the original photo was taken as a joke and the woman in the photo is not supportive of the old regime.", "Understate": "There is no evidence of understating in the claim.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not providing enough evidence or support for the accusation against Thuli Madonsela.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a doctored image and does not provide any additional evidence to back up the accusation.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the doctored image is a true representation of Thuli Madonsela's actions and beliefs, without considering the context or the explanation provided by the person in the original photo.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the original photo was taken as a joke at a themed event and does not reflect Madonsela's support for the apartheid regime."}
