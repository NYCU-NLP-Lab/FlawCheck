{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating Tommy Thompson's statement by saying he wants to \"do away with Medicare.\" Thompson actually proposed giving people a choice between traditional Medicare and purchasing health insurance with a subsidy.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide enough evidence or context to fully support the accusation that Thompson wants to \"do away with Medicare.\"", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Thompson's support for Paul Ryan's plan to reform Medicare means he wants to eliminate it entirely, which may be a problematic assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for Thompson's statement, such as his concern about the financial sustainability of Medicare in the future.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter by not fully addressing the details of Thompson's proposal and presenting a simplified version of his stance on Medicare."}
