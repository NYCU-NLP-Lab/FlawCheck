{"Exaggerate": "The claim suggests that the EPA completely outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation, which may be an exaggeration as the EPA stated that it relied on the work of three groups and its scientists provided input to these groups.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that the international organization in question is scandal-plagued or untrustworthy.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that outsourcing the scientific basis for greenhouse gas regulation is inherently problematic, without providing any evidence or rationale for why this is the case.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider or acknowledge any alternative explanations for the EPA's approach, such as the need for comprehensive and global analysis of scientific studies on climate change."}
