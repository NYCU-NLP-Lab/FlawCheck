{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the percentage of abortions in Planned Parenthood's pregnancy services. The actual figure is 94 percent, not \"almost 95 percent.\"", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a fact sheet created by the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion. The fact sheet's numbers are derived from Planned Parenthood's annual report, but the claim does not provide additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the category of \"pregnancy services\" is a valid and accurate representation of Planned Parenthood's services. However, this category was created by the Susan B. Anthony List and may not align with Planned Parenthood's own categorization.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of abortions in Planned Parenthood's pregnancy services, such as the fact that not all clinics offer prenatal care and many pregnant women are referred to outside providers for such services.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for \"pregnancy services\" and does not specifically track the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for reasons other than prenatal care, abortion, or adoption."}
