{"Falters at times": "The claim falters at times because it inaccurately states that AR-15 rifles were used in every major mass shooting since 2012, but it was not used in the Santa Fe High School shooting.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific evidence or data to back up the statement that AR-15 rifles were used in every major mass shooting since 2012.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption that the use of AR-15 rifles in several widely-covered mass shootings implies a causal relationship between the weapon and the occurrence of these shootings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim as the Santa Fe High School shooting, which is included in the claim, did not involve the use of an AR-15 rifle but instead a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver.", "Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the prevalence of AR-15 rifles in major mass shootings by stating that they were used in every such incident since 2012, when there are exceptions such as the Santa Fe High School shooting.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that an AR-15 rifle was not used in the Santa Fe High School shooting, as confirmed by the governor's press conference."}
