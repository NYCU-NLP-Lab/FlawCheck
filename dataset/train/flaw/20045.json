{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the situation by stating that the Philippine Congress has decided to prevent the renewal of ABS-CBN's license. The expert's verdict mentions that four bills for the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise were filed during the current congressional session, indicating that the decision is still pending.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the rejection of the bill to renew ABS-CBN's franchise is a deliberate action by the Philippine Congress. However, the expert's verdict mentions that President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to object to the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise due to the network's alleged refusal to air his campaign ad during the 2016 presidential elections. This suggests that the rejection may be influenced by political factors rather than a straightforward decision by the Congress.", "Lack enough support": "The claim does not provide sufficient evidence or sources to support the statement that the Philippine Congress has decided to prevent the renewal of ABS-CBN's license. The expert's verdict mentions that the headline of the article claims the verdict has been given, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or official statements from the Congress.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to object to the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise. This alternative explanation suggests that the rejection of the bill may be influenced by political motivations rather than a straightforward decision by the Congress."}
