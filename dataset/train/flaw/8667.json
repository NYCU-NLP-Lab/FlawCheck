{"Understates": "The claim of \"General Motors is making record profits\" may understate the actual financial performance of the company. The expert's verdict highlights that profits can vary depending on the time period and that the increase in profits leveled off in 2016.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters at times as it fails to consider the fluctuating nature of profits and the specific time period in question. The expert points out that profits are measured over a period of time, and simply stating \"record profits\" without specifying the timeframe can be misleading.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or evidence to back up the assertion of \"record profits.\" The expert's verdict mentions specific figures and income data from GM's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, which suggests that the claim may not have enough supporting evidence.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the record profits are solely attributable to the hard work of union members. The expert's verdict highlights that the increased profits in 2015 were driven by factors such as increased demand for high-margin vehicles, particularly trucks and utility vehicles.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the increased profits, stating that the popularity of high-margin vehicles like trucks and crossovers contributed to the financial success of GM. This suggests that the claim may overlook other factors influencing the company's profitability."}
