{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. The truth is that Trump admitted to breaching fiduciary duties and allowing his campaign to take control over a fundraiser for veterans, but the funds were still given to veterans.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it mischaracterizes what Trump agreed to in a lawsuit settlement. The settlement did not involve illegal diversion of charitable contributions, but rather a breach of fiduciary duties.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes a problematic assumption by stating that Trump's actions would have gotten any other president out of the White House. This assumption is not supported by evidence or historical precedent.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Trump did not confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions. Rather, he admitted to breaching fiduciary duties and allowing his campaign to take control over a fundraiser for veterans.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation exists for Trump's actions, which is that he allowed his campaign to coordinate a fundraising event for veterans instead of his charitable foundation, in order to further his political campaign.", "Understate": "The claim understates the nature of Trump's admission by not accurately portraying the breach of fiduciary duties and the involvement of his campaign in the fundraising event for veterans."}
