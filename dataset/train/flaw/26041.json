{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is contradicted by multiple sources and reports that state Pope Francis did not grant diplomatic immunity to Monsignor Carlo Alberto Capella.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Pope Francis did not grant diplomatic immunity to Capella, but rather Capella already possessed that status by default as an accredited Vatican diplomat.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the situation by stating that Pope Francis granted diplomatic immunity to Capella, when in fact he did not.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the Vatican's refusal to waive Capella's diplomatic immunity was solely for the purpose of protecting him from prosecution, without considering other possible reasons for their decision.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the Vatican's refusal to waive diplomatic immunity was to bring Capella back to the Vatican to face justice there, as suggested by the announcement of a criminal investigation against him.", "Understate": "The claim understates the fact that Capella was convicted and sentenced by a court in the Vatican City for possessing and distributing child pornography while commissioned in the United States."}
