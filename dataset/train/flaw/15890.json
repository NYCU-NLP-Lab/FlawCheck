{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that the South Korean president announced the procurement of 45 million China-made coronavirus vaccines after the Chinese foreign minister's visit. There is no evidence or official statement supporting this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there are no credible reports or official statements confirming that South Korea has been promised novel coronavirus vaccines from China during talks with the Chinese foreign minister.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the vaccines mentioned in the misleading social media posts are effective because they were made in China, where the coronavirus originated. However, there is no evidence or scientific basis provided to support this assumption.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the official statements from both South Korea's presidential office and foreign ministry, which make no reference to discussions or agreements on the importation of China-made novel coronavirus vaccines.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that the ruling Democratic Party in South Korea aims to secure sufficient coronavirus vaccines for the country's population, but there is no specific mention of sourcing these vaccines from China in the reports and statements mentioned."}
