{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the likelihood of being arrested before being shot in the city of Newark. While the expert's verdict confirms that many gun violence victims in Newark have a criminal history, the claim presents the statistic as if it applies to all shooting victims, which may be an exaggeration.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks specific data or evidence to support the claim that over 80% of shooting victims in Newark have been arrested an average of 10 times before being shot. The expert's verdict mentions ongoing research by Anthony Braga, but the study is not yet completed or published.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes a causal relationship between being shot and having a criminal history, implying that the criminal justice system is not effective in preventing future violence. However, this assumption may oversimplify the complex factors contributing to gun violence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the high percentage of shooting victims with a criminal history. It does not explore other factors such as socioeconomic conditions, gang activity, or systemic issues that may contribute to the correlation between criminal history and gun violence in Newark."}
