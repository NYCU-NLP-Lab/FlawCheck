{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the number of lawsuits against Tom Ganley by stating that he has been \"sued over 400 times, for fraud, discrimination and more.\" The expert's verdict mentions that Ganley was named in well over 400 suits, but when weighted for volume and time in operation, it appeared to be comparable to other large auto groups.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove the allegations of fraud, discrimination, and other misconduct against Tom Ganley. The expert's verdict mentions that many of the lawsuits involve issues such as Lemon Law cases, damaged cars being sold as new, and lending a potentially stolen car, but it does not provide extensive details or conclusive evidence for each claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lawsuits and a judge's statement about Tom Ganley's business practices being \"deceptive and unconscionable\" are accurate and represent his overall character. The expert's verdict mentions that Ganley's campaign characterized some of the lawsuits as disgruntled employees and that Lemon Law cases do not necessarily reflect on the way a dealer does business.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the lawsuits against Tom Ganley, such as disgruntled employees or the nature of Lemon Law cases. The expert's verdict mentions that Ganley's campaign characterized some of the lawsuits as disgruntled employees, suggesting that there may be alternative explanations for the lawsuits filed against him.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the impact or significance of the lawsuits against Tom Ganley by not providing enough context or comparison to other dealerships. The expert's verdict mentions that when the number of lawsuits is weighted for volume and time in operation, it appears comparable to the record of four other large auto groups examined.", "Contradict fact": "There is no clear contradiction of fact in the claim or the expert's verdict. Both acknowledge that lawsuits have been filed against Tom Ganley, but the extent and nature of those lawsuits may be subject to interpretation and perspective.", "Falters at times": "There is no clear indication that the claim falters at times or presents inconsistent information. The expert's verdict provides additional context and analysis of the lawsuits against Tom Ganley but does not highlight any significant inconsistencies in the claim."}
