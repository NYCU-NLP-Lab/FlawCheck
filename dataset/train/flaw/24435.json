{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of the reasons for admission to insane asylums in the 19th century by using the term \"myriad\" without providing specific evidence or numbers to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any specific evidence or data to back up the assertion that there were numerous reasons for people being committed to insane asylums in the 19th century.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the reasons listed for admission to insane asylums in the 19th century were universally accepted as symptoms of mental instability, which may be a problematic assumption. The expert's verdict explains that these reasons were recorded as factors that might have produced or exacerbated underlying mental illnesses, rather than being considered symptoms of mental illness themselves.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict suggests that the reasons listed for admission to insane asylums may not have been universally seen as symptoms of mental illness, but rather factors that could have contributed to or worsened existing mental health conditions. This alternative explanation challenges the claim that these reasons directly led to people being committed to asylums."}
