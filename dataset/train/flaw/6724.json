{"Understate": "The claim may understate the extent of the removal of USDA reports on safety and hygiene standards at animal facilities. The expert's verdict mentions that the searchable database was temporarily removed and some documents were no longer available or lacked identifying information. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the overall impact or extent of the removal.", "Lack enough support": "The claim may lack enough support to fully substantiate the assertion that the Trump administration blocked public access to USDA reports. The expert's verdict mentions that the searchable database was restored in August 2017 and inspection reports were publicly available at the time the claim was made. This suggests that there may have been a temporary disruption or limitation of access, but it does not necessarily imply a complete blockage.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim may make a problematic assumption that the removal of the searchable database was solely attributable to the Trump administration. The expert's verdict mentions that the removal was part of a review that began before the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations and was connected to a lawsuit against the USDA. This suggests that there may have been other factors at play beyond the actions of the Trump administration.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may not fully consider alternative explanations for the removal of USDA reports. The expert's verdict mentions that the removal was connected to a lawsuit against the USDA, indicating that legal considerations may have influenced the decision. This suggests that there may be alternative explanations beyond solely attributing it to the actions of the Trump administration."}
