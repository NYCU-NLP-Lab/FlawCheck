{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the amount of ice at the polar ice caps in 2015 by stating that there was \"more ice than ever before\" when in fact, the extent of Arctic sea ice and land ice sheets have been steadily shrinking for decades.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the extent of Antarctic sea ice did peak in 2015 but then hit a low in 2016, indicating a decline in ice.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide any evidence or data to substantiate the claim of there being more ice than ever before in 2015.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the problematic assumption that the extent of sea ice is representative of the overall ice at the polar ice caps, ignoring the different types of ice and their variations.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the decline in Arctic sea ice and land ice sheets has been ongoing for decades, suggesting that the claim's focus on 2015 alone is not sufficient to understand the overall trend."}
