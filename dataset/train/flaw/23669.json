{"Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that CNN did not report the Boulder, Colorado, suspect as being \"Arab, but morally white.\" This is confirmed by the statement from Matt Dornic, head of strategic communications for CNN Worldwide, who stated that the image was doctored and never aired by CNN.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the alleged report by CNN by using the phrase \"Arab, but morally white,\" which implies a contradiction in terms and could be seen as an exaggeration of the suspect's identity.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a doctored image that was not actually reported by CNN. The original CNN report and a company spokesperson confirm that the image has been altered.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that CNN reported the suspect as \"Arab, but morally white\" without providing any evidence or credible sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The alternative explanation is that the claim is a result of a doctored image that was created to spread misinformation and falsely attribute a statement to CNN."}
