{"Lack enough support": "The claim that there is no language in the U.S. Constitution preventing someone from running for Congress simultaneously in multiple states lacks enough support as it is not a commonly known or accepted practice.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the lack of explicit language in the Constitution means that it is permissible to run for Congress in multiple states, which is a problematic assumption as the Constitution may be interpreted differently by different experts.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim may have alternative explanations that contradict the idea of running for Congress in multiple states, such as the requirement of being an inhabitant of the state \"when elected\" as stated in Article I, Section II of the U.S. Constitution."}
