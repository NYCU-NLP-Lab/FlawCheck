{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the extent of discrimination against LGBT people in North Carolina, stating that the new law \"orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020.\" While the law does retain some controversial provisions, it does not explicitly order discrimination against LGBT individuals.", "Understate": "The claim understates the changes made by the new law, particularly regarding bathroom access. It suggests that \"unfair \u2018bathroom bans\u2019 remain,\" when in fact the law removed the provision that required individuals to use the bathroom corresponding to their birth gender.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up its assertion that North Carolina's replacement for HB2 orders cities to discriminate against LGBT people. It does not provide specific details or examples to support this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the new law is discriminatory and unfair without providing a thorough analysis or explanation of why it is considered as such. It assumes that any restrictions or regulations regarding bathroom access are inherently discriminatory.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for the retention of certain provisions in the new law, such as concerns about privacy and safety in bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers. It presents the retention of these provisions solely as a means of discrimination against LGBT people."}
