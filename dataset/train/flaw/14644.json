{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the impact of the Canadian boycott of American products and holiday destinations by stating that 75 percent of Canadians stopped travelling to the US because of the trade war, when in reality, the actual number of border crossings only dropped by 19 percent.", "Lack enough support": "The claim is based on a single poll of travel intentions, which may not accurately reflect the actual behavior of Canadians. The poll shows that 57 percent of respondents were \"likely to stop or cut back travel to the US,\" but it does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that 75 percent of Canadians actually stopped travelling to the US.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the drop in border crossings, such as seasonal variations or other factors unrelated to the trade war. The expert mentions that some Canadians did strike the US from their vacation destination list, but this does not reflect a general trend.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that there were actually more Canadian border crossings in June 2018 than in June 2017, according to data from Customs and Border Protection. This contradicts the claim that 75 percent of Canadians stopped travelling to the US.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by relying on a single poll and failing to consider actual border crossing data, which shows a different picture than what is claimed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the poll of travel intentions accurately reflects the behavior of Canadians, without considering other factors or data that may influence travel decisions."}
