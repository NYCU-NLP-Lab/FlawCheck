{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the existence of a woman named \"Tea Cup Sallie\" and her prostitution license.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the woman in the photograph is indeed \"Tea Cup Sallie\" and that she was a notorious prostitute, without any substantial evidence.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the \"license for prostitution\" is a modern recreation and not a genuine artifact from the late 1800s.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the mundane nature of the photograph, originally showing a \"tea lady,\" rather than a notorious prostitute.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There are alternative explanations for the existence of the \"license for prostitution,\" such as it being a novelty item loosely based on historical events, rather than a genuine artifact."}
