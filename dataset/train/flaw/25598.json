{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the capabilities of the EVMs by suggesting that they record all votes for the BJP and that the party has confidential voter information. This is not supported by any evidence or factual information.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to back up the statement that EVMs record all votes for the BJP and that the party has confidential voter information. The video and statements provided do not provide any concrete proof of these claims.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the BJP candidate's comments in the video are accurate and true, without questioning or verifying the information. This assumption can be problematic as it may lead to the spread of misinformation or false claims.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the statements made by the BJP candidate. It is possible that the comments were taken out of context or misinterpreted. The candidate himself claims that his speech was doctored by the opposition for political gains, which suggests there may be alternative explanations for the statements made in the video."}
