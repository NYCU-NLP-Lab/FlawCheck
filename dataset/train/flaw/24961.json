{"Exaggerate": "The claim of saving over $5.2 billion may be an exaggeration as it refers to future savings from refinanced state debt, rather than an existing pot of $5 billion.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or explanation to support the assertion of saving taxpayers and ratepayers over $5.2 billion.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the future savings from refinanced state debt will materialize immediately, which may not be the case as the savings will add up over decades.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters in providing clear evidence or explanation during the forum, leading to ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual savings.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There may be alternative explanations for the claimed savings, such as favorable interest rates, rather than solely attributed to the actions of the treasurer."}
