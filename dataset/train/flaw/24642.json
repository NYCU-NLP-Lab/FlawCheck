{"Exaggerate\n2": "Lack enough support", "Problematic assumption\n4": "Exist alternative explanation", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by stating that there were \"zero investigations\" of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, key aspects of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War, and embassy attacks under George W. Bush. This is not accurate, as there were investigations conducted for these incidents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to back up its assertion that there were no investigations for these incidents. The provided evidence contradicts the claim by mentioning investigations that did take place.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because there were no investigations mentioned in the provided graphic, there were no investigations at all. This is a problematic assumption as it overlooks the existence of investigations that were conducted.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim fails to consider alternative explanations for the lack of investigations mentioned in the graphic. It does not explore possible reasons why certain incidents may not have been investigated or why they were not included in the graphic."}
