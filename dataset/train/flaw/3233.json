{"Understate": "The claim underestimates the number of children contracting the coronavirus by stating that \"children don't seem to be getting this virus\" when there have been hundreds of cases reported in Wisconsin and tens of thousands in the U.S.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the statement that \"children don't seem to be getting this virus\" as there have been cases reported in both Wisconsin and the U.S.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that because children are not at higher risk for the virus and generally experience milder symptoms, they are not contracting the virus. However, this assumption is problematic as there have been confirmed cases of children contracting COVID-19.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim ignores the alternative explanation that while children may not be at higher risk or experience severe symptoms, they can still contract the virus and potentially transmit it to others."}
