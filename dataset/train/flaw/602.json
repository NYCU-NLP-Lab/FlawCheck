{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the difference in pay between federal workers and private sector workers by stating that federal workers make twice as much.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or data to support the assertion that the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the average person would interpret \"makes twice as much\" as referring to wages only, without considering the inclusion of benefits in the comparison.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The BEA spokesman and John Berry, director of the federal Office of Personnel Management, provide alternative explanations for the difference in pay, highlighting the different mix of jobs performed by federal and private sector employees and the inclusion of benefits in the comparison."}
