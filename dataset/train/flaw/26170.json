{"Lack enough support": "The claim that Vitamin C and lemon in hot water protect against coronavirus lacks enough scientific evidence to support it. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence that using a large amount of Vitamin C gets rid of the novel coronavirus and that there are limited evidence-based clinical trials to conclusively support the contention that vitamin C can prevent infection.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that using Vitamin C and lemon in hot water can protect against coronavirus without providing sufficient evidence or scientific backing.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides alternative explanations for the claims made. For example, it states that Professor Chen Horin, who is claimed to have made the statement about lemon in hot water, is a fictitious character, and the image used in the post is of a different person. It also mentions that the novel coronavirus is not the result of a gene fusion between a snake and a bat, as claimed in the message.", "Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the potential benefits of using Vitamin C and lemon in hot water by stating that it can \"save your life\" and that hot lemon can cure all cancers. The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence to support these claims.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts scientific facts by suggesting that Vitamin C and lemon in hot water can protect against coronavirus without providing sufficient evidence or scientific support.", "Understate": "There is no clear evidence of understatement bias in the provided claim."}
