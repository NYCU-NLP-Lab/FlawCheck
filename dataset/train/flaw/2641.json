{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that Michelle Obama praised Harvey Weinstein as a \"wonderful human being\" and a \"good friend.\" This is supported by the expert's statement that the claim is based on an old video that resurfaced online, but it does not provide additional evidence or context.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Michelle Obama's praise of Harvey Weinstein in 2013 is an endorsement of his offenses, without considering the fact that the accusations against Weinstein came to light four years later. This assumption is problematic as it overlooks the timeline and context of Obama's remarks.", "Exist alternative explanation": "An alternative explanation could be that Michelle Obama's praise of Harvey Weinstein in 2013 was based on their professional relationship and his involvement in organizing the Student Film Symposium, rather than a personal endorsement of his actions. This alternative explanation challenges the claim's implication that Obama's praise was in support of Weinstein's alleged offenses.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the significance of Michelle Obama's remarks by not providing the full context and presenting them as a single isolated incident. The expert's statement highlights that Obama's praise was made during a speech at the White House and in the presence of Weinstein himself, suggesting that it was a more significant event than portrayed in the claim.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that Michelle Obama's remarks praising Harvey Weinstein were made in 2013, four years before the allegations against him became public. This contradiction is important in understanding the context and intent of Obama's comments, which the claim fails to acknowledge.", "Exaggerate": "There is no clear evidence of exaggeration in the claim. The claim accurately states Michelle Obama's remarks, but it may lack the necessary context to fully understand their meaning and intent.", "Falters at times": "The claim may falter at times by not providing a comprehensive analysis of Michelle Obama's relationship with Harvey Weinstein and the context of her remarks. It focuses primarily on the specific video clip and does not explore other aspects that could provide a more nuanced perspective."}
