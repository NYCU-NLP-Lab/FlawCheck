{"Exaggerate": "The claim may exaggerate the significance of Bruce Ohr's connection to Fusion GPS and the dossier by stating that the FBI used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. The claim does not provide enough evidence to support this assertion.", "Understate": "The claim may understate the complexity and ongoing nature of the investigation into Bruce Ohr's relationship with Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS. The expert's verdict mentions that details are still emerging and that much has already been reported.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the FBI used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. It does not provide any specific details or sources to back up this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Bruce Ohr's connection to Fusion GPS and his wife's employment there automatically implicates him in any alleged wrongdoing related to the dossier. This assumption may be problematic without further evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The claim does not consider alternative explanations for Bruce Ohr's actions, such as his role as a Justice Department official and his duty to share relevant information with the FBI. It assumes a nefarious motive without exploring other possibilities."}
