{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the impact of the outcomes-based funding model by stating that it is \"changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business.\" The expert's analysis does not provide enough evidence to support this claim.", "Lack enough support": "The expert's analysis does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that Tennessee's higher education funding model is \"100 percent outcomes-based.\" More information is needed to determine the accuracy of this claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the outcomes-based funding model is the sole reason for changing the way postsecondary institutions do business. However, the expert's analysis does not provide enough information to determine if this assumption is valid or if there are alternative explanations for the observed changes in institutions' behavior."}
