{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates by suggesting that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez started \"chain migration\" deportation proceedings against First Lady Melania Trump and her parents.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it is based on a fictional story published by a website known for distributing satirical content.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Ocasio-Cortez wants to use \"chain migration\" to deport the first lady and her parents, without providing any evidence or credible sources to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation that the claim is entirely fictional and not based on any factual events or actions taken by Ocasio-Cortez."}
