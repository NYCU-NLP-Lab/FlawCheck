{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the size and significance of the snake by calling it a \"giant snake\" and stating that it emerged from the dam after heavy rain.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or proof to support the existence of a giant snake at the Kabini dam near Mysuru.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the video is authentic and represents a real event, without providing any substantial evidence.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation for the video, suggesting that it is a manipulated or edited version of a video showing a snake crossing a road, not a river.", "Contradict fact": "The claim contradicts the fact that the video is not from the Kabini dam in Karnataka and does not represent a giant snake emerging after heavy rain."}
