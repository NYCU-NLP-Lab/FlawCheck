{"Exaggerate": "The claim may be exaggerating the extent to which Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate. The provided evidence shows a split opinion among Americans, with some polls showing more opposition and others showing more support for the law.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as it does not provide specific data or statistics to back up the assertion of overwhelming opposition to Obamacare and the individual mandate. The evidence provided includes various poll results, but they do not consistently show a clear majority against the law.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that the American public is overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare and the individual mandate based on the opinion of Rick Santorum. However, the evidence provided does not conclusively support this assumption, as the poll results show a divided opinion on the issue.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There could be alternative explanations for the varying poll results, such as different sampling methods, question wordings, or demographics of the respondents. The claim does not consider these alternative explanations and presents the poll results as a direct reflection of public opinion."}
