{"Lack enough support": "The claim lacks sufficient evidence or support to prove that the photograph shows Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and George Wallace together at a table. The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph is real and was taken in 1983, but it does not provide any additional evidence or sources to further support the claim.", "Problematic assumption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the photograph was shared with the caption \"Planning for 'The New World Order'\", suggesting a possible assumption or conspiracy theory. However, there is no evidence or information provided to support this assumption, making it problematic.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict mentions that it is impossible to tell what the three men were discussing in the photograph. This leaves room for alternative explanations or interpretations of the photograph, suggesting that the claim may not accurately represent the true nature of the interaction between the individuals depicted."}
