{"Contradict fact": "The claim that the meme depicts George Soros as a Nazi guard is contradicted by the expert's verdict, which states that the photo in the meme is actually of a Nazi guard who died earlier this year.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support as there is no evidence to support that Soros was ever a Nazi, despite conspiracy theories that have been proposed.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim makes the assumption that the meme accurately represents George Soros as a Nazi guard, which is a problematic assumption given the evidence provided by the expert.", "Exist alternative explanation": "The expert's verdict provides an alternative explanation by stating that the photo in the meme is actually of a Nazi guard named Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, not George Soros."}
