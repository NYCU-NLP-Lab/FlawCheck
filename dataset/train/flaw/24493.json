{"Exaggerate": "The claim exaggerates the number of senators who supported the background checks and assault weapons ban, stating that 54 senators were in favor, when in reality, the Manchin-Toomey amendment received 54 votes, but fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass.", "Falters at times": "The claim falters by not accurately representing the details of the failed gun control measures in April 2013, where all the proposed measures, including the assault weapons ban, failed to pass.", "Lack enough support": "The claim lacks enough support to substantiate the statement that the filibuster was the sole reason for the failure of the gun control measures. Other factors, such as the lack of sufficient votes and party divisions, played a role in the failure.", "Problematic assumption": "The claim assumes that Congress is beholden to the gun industry and implies that this is the reason why tighter gun control laws do not happen, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption.", "Exist alternative explanation": "There is an alternative explanation to the claim, which is that the failure of the gun control measures was due to a combination of factors, including the lack of sufficient votes and party divisions, rather than solely because of the filibuster."}
