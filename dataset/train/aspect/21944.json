{"The absence of the image on the official website": "The expert's verdict mentions that the cover pages of National Geographic magazine for November and December 2020 did not feature an image of a Sikh man or dedicate the cover picture to the farmers' protests in India. This discrepancy raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Social media sharing by specific individuals": "The expert's verdict notes that the purported cover picture was shared on Twitter by specific individuals, including AAP supporter Raj Lali Gill, Congress leader Ajoy Kumar, and others who criticized the BJP government. This information suggests that the image may have been shared for political or ideological reasons, potentially affecting its credibility.", "Watermark and volume number": "The viral image carries the watermark '@anoopreet' and the volume number '1984 NO.2'. These details indicate that the image is not an official cover of National Geographic but rather a conceptual artwork by Instagram user @anoopreet. This finding undermines the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of alignment with other cover pictures": "The expert's verdict highlights that none of the cover pictures since June 2020 (when the farm bills were passed) and January 2021 feature the image of a Sikh man or relate to the farmers' protests. This inconsistency further casts doubt on the claim's veracity."}
