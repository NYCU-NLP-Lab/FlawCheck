{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that a weapons cache hidden by former President Barack Obama was exposed by flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. The claim is based on speculation and conspiracy theories without any factual basis.", "Satirical nature of the source": "The expert points out that the website OurLandOfTheFree.com, which published the story, includes a disclaimer stating that its content should be considered satirical and that it does not guarantee any factual basis. This indicates that the claim is not meant to be taken seriously.", "Inaccurate information and fictional locations": "The expert mentions that the claim refers to a town called \"Lexmar\" and \"Kirkmere, Texas,\" which do not exist. The inclusion of fictional locations raises doubts about the credibility of the claim and suggests that it may be fabricated.", "Use of unrelated images": "The expert reveals that the image accompanying the claim, allegedly taken in \"Kirkmere, Texas,\" was actually taken in 2010 outside a Russian ammunition warehouse. This demonstrates that the image is unrelated to the claim and was likely used to mislead readers."}
