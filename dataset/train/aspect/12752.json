{"The claim misquotes Joe Biden": "s statement at the town hall meeting, falsely stating that he grew up in Section 8 housing when he actually said that the building he once lived in later became Section 8 housing.", "Section 8 housing did not exist in the 1940s when Biden was a child": "as it was created in 1974 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.", "The transcript of the town hall meeting shows that Biden clearly did not say he grew up in Section 8 housing": "but rather mentioned living in normal apartments that later became Section 8 housing.", "Biden has consistently referred to his working": "class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, but his recent comments about his childhood have been misquoted in numerous Facebook posts."}
