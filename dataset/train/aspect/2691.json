{"Rep": "Bart Stupak's statement: The expert mentions Rep. Bart Stupak's statement in which he claims that the Senate bill includes provisions for federal government subsidies for abortions and requires every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management enrolled plan to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, including abortions. This statement is considered as evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Senate bill language": "The expert explains that the Senate bill, written by Sen. Ben Nelson, allows insurance companies in the exchange to offer abortion services but requires that all enrollees in these plans pay a separate amount to cover the actuarial value of abortion services for the entire population covered by the plan. The fact that the Senate bill includes such provisions supports the claim's authenticity.", "Cost comparison": "The expert mentions that it actually costs insurance companies less to pay for abortions than it does to pay for prenatal care and delivery. This cost comparison aspect is relevant in verifying the claim as it explains why the Senate bill requires a separate payment for abortion services and why it is set at a minimum of $1 per enrollee per month.", "Specific language in the Senate bill": "The expert highlights that the Senate bill explicitly states that the actuarial estimate for abortion services should not take into account any cost reduction estimated to result from such services, including prenatal care, delivery, or postnatal care. This specific language in the bill reinforces the claim's authenticity by demonstrating the intention to separate the cost of abortion services from other healthcare expenses."}
