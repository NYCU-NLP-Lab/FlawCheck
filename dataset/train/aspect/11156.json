{"The origin of the photograph": "The expert found that the photograph had been online since at least 2013, which was before Donald Trump became president. It was originally featured in an article on the Swedish blog Aftonbladet and captured a small parade of \"transvestites\" during New York City's annual gay pride parade.", "Lack of evidence of protest against President Trump": "The expert concluded that the photograph did not actually show anyone protesting against President Trump. The claim made in the meme was unsupported by any evidence or context within the image.", "Previous instances of similar misleading tactics": "The expert noted that this was not the first time such tactics had been employed by online trolls. In January 2018, an image from a 2010 gay pride parade in Germany was shared as if it depicted a group of \"mentally unstable\" people protesting President Trump in the United States. This suggests a pattern of using unrelated images to create false narratives.", "Context and motive behind the meme": "The expert highlighted that the meme was promoting the #walkaway movement, an online campaign pushed by conservatives and sometimes Russian bots to encourage Democrats to leave the Democratic party. The meme used the photograph and the false claim to insinuate that the pictured individuals were mentally unstable, thereby discrediting them and promoting a particular political agenda."}
