{"Social media posts spreading awareness": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the presence of social media posts alerting readers to the change in Texas law regarding insurance claims related to weather damage. These posts were made on 27 August 2017, before the law came into effect on 1 September 2017.", "Legislative changes": "The expert mentioned that the changes in Texas law were made by H.B. 1774, which specifically hampered the ability of property owners to challenge insurance companies if they delayed or denied their claims. The expert provided details about the provisions in the bill that lessened penalties for insurance companies and limited the ability to collect attorney's fees.", "Encouragement from a lawmaker": "Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro encouraged Texans affected by Tropical Storm Harvey to file their insurance claims before 1 September. This statement from a lawmaker added credibility to the claim and suggested that there might be some urgency to file claims before the new law took effect.", "Clarification on the scope of the law": "The expert clarified that the changes introduced by Texas House Bill 1774 only applied to litigated disputes over insurance claims. Most insurance claims are settled out of court, so the potential benefit of filing a claim before 1 September would likely not apply in most cases. This aspect provided a more nuanced understanding of the impact of the law."}
