{"Digital verification tool": "The expert used a digital verification tool called Invid to break down the video into multiple frames and perform reverse searches on the Russian search engine Yandex. This tool helped in analyzing the video and finding relevant information to verify its authenticity.", "Reverse search on Yandex": "The expert performed reverse searches on Yandex using the frames from the video and found a similar video posted on YouTube on August 31, 2019. This helped in establishing the existence of the video prior to the claim being made.", "Comparison with another clip": "The expert found a better quality clip of the same incident on Yandex and observed that it showed a group of people pelting bricks at the bus, whereas the viral video had mischievously clipped a portion where a man donning a skull cap was throwing a brick. This comparison helped in identifying the manipulation in the viral video.", "Investigation and reporting": "The expert conducted further investigation by referring to a video report and Gujarati daily Divya Bhaskar. These sources provided information about the incident being an accident on Satya Nagar BRTS road in Surat, Gujarat, from almost three years ago. The incident involved a bus hitting a pedestrian, leading to outrage and stone pelting. This investigation helped in confirming the true context of the video and debunking the claim made by the British commentator."}
