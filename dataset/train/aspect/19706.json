Instead, it showed a cruise ship sailing around the Greek Islands en route to Italy.", "Identification of the original source": "The expert identified the original source of one of the viral videos as a Twitter user named @RenukaJain6. This helped in tracing the origin of the claim and verifying its authenticity.", "Comparison with previous viral instances": "The expert also noted that the same video had gone viral in 2020, indicating that it was not a recent occurrence.
