{"Multiple instances of the claim being shared on Facebook": "The expert's verdict mentions that the text graphic claiming the crime statistics was shared on Facebook in several posts, providing links to some of them. This indicates that the claim was circulating on social media.", "Inconsistencies in the claim": "The expert points out that the claim contradicts the statistics provided by legitimate sources such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program and the State of California's Department of Justice. This suggests that the claim is not based on accurate data.", "Expert opinion": "The expert, Justin Nix, an associate professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice, states that the statistics in the graphic are \"completely bogus\" and provides evidence from the FBI's data to support his statement. This expert opinion discredits the authenticity of the claim.", "Alternative sources of data": "The expert refers to The Washington Post's database on fatal police shootings and Mapping Police Violence, both of which provide alternative statistics on police killings. These sources present different numbers than the claim, further undermining its credibility."}
