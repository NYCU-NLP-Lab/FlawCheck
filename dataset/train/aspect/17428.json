{"The claim made by Rep": "Ami Bera that Scott Jones \"wants to build a wall\" was verified by pointing to a November 2014 video in which Jones calls on President Obama to \"build up that wall.\" This video serves as evidence of Jones advocating for the construction of a wall.", "The Bera campaign": "s assertion that Jones \"wants to round people up and deport folks\" was not explicitly backed up with specific evidence. It is unclear whether this aspect of the claim was verified or not.", "Jack Pitney": "a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, stated that it is a stretch to say that Jones was advocating for the same massive wall along the Southern border that Trump has called for. This expert opinion suggests that Jones' stance on building a wall may not align with Trump's proposal.", "The": "Immigration Reform Plan\" released by the Jones campaign was cited as another aspect employed to verify the claim. This plan includes measures such as increased border patrols, enhanced fencing and technology, and consequences for illegal entry. While it does not explicitly mention building a wall, these proposed actions could be seen as addressing border security."}
