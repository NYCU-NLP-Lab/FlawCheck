{"The claim was initially made on Twitter by Shiv Yadav": "who posted a photograph of Vinay Dubey along with a man and a woman, claiming that Dubey's father's name is Mahmood and he tried to conceal his identity.", "The claim was also shared on Facebook by Vinubhai Patel": "who posted the same photograph with a similar narrative, which garnered over 19,000 shares.", "Fact": "checking outlet Alt News found that the claim made by Yadav and Patel is false. They conducted a Google search and found the personal details submitted by Dubey when he filed a nomination for the Kalyan Lok Sabha seat, which revealed that his father's name is Jatashankar Dubey, not Mahmood as claimed on social media.", "SMHoaxslayer": "another fact-checking outlet, found that the viral photograph was posted from Dubey's Facebook profile in February 2020 and is from a CAA protest in Patna, Bihar. It is likely that the man and woman in the photo are protesters, not Dubey's parents."}
