{"The claim made by the Portland Public Schools Board newsletter was brought to the attention of PolitiFact Oregon by a reader who wanted to verify its authenticity": "2. The Portland Schools spokesman, Matt Shelby, confirmed that employees started paying their own retirement contributions in 1995, as per Resolution #5745 passed by the board in 1994.", "The claim was further supported by the fact that in November 1994": "voters approved Ballot Measure 8, which required public employees to pay their share into retirement. Although the measure was later invalidated by the Oregon Supreme Court, some government bodies, including Portland schools, made plans to increase workers' pay to offset the pension pickup.", "It was noted that Portland Public Schools is in the minority when it comes to the pickup": "as only 55 percent of its workers have the employee share picked up by the district, while other employer groups, such as state government and cities/counties, cover a higher percentage of their workers' share."}
