Supreme Court is expected to rule later this month in a lawsuit that could potentially eliminate premium subsidies for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act.", "Approximately 6": "4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states who use the federal marketplace could be at risk of losing a total of $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits and face significant premium increases.", "There is resistance from many GOP members": "particularly Tea Party Republicans, to extending the subsidies, as they prioritize appeasing their base over the potential loss of subsidies for constituents.", "The claim made by Georgia Congressman Austin Scott that": "Ninety-seven percent of Americans aren't receiving those subsidies\" is being disputed, as it includes individuals who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance, estimates of all insurance subsidies (state and federal combined), and other factors that make it difficult to determine the exact percentage."}
