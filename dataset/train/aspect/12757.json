{"State Rep": "Donna Howard made the claim that Texas charter schools receive 100% state funding per pupil, while district schools receive about 1/3 funding from the state with the rest coming from local property taxes.", "The claim was fact": "checked by PolitiFact Texas, who rated it as Mostly True.", "Bruce Marchand of the Texas Charter Schools Association called the claim": "squishy solid\" and stated that districts receive less money because state dollars follow students based on where they're enrolled, not because the money is going to charters.", "It was confirmed that charter schools in Texas receive nearly all their funding from state aid": "with only 3% coming from grants and federal sources, due to their lack of authority to levy property taxes."}
