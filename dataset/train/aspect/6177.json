This information helps verify the claim by providing context on the historical changes in these taxes.", "Senate floor debate": "The expert's verdict mentions a Senate floor debate in 2009 where Patrick resisted a push to raise gas tax rates locally. This debate and Patrick's statement during it provide additional evidence of his stance on taxes, supporting the claim that he has not been advocating for tax increases."}
