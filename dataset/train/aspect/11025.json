{"The total number of people employed in Indiana": "The expert verifies that there are indeed more people employed in Indiana than ever before, with a record high of 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Historical population growth": "The expert points out that the historical peak in employment cited by Pence is more related to long-term population growth rather than the strength of the economy. This aspect highlights the need to consider the percentage of people working, rather than just the raw number.", "Percentage of population working": "The expert calculates the percentage of Indiana residents working in both 2000 and 2016, revealing that a higher percentage of the population was working in 2000 (49.7%) compared to 2016 (47.3%). This aspect challenges Pence's assertion and suggests that the job market may not be as robust as claimed.", "Comparison of working population between age groups": "The expert also compares the percentage of Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64 who are working in 2000 and 2016. The findings show a decline from 80.5% in 2000 to 75.4% in 2016, further supporting the argument that the job market may not be as strong as implied by Pence's statement."}
