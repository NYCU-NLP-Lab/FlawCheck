{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was a closer examination of the photograph itself": "It was observed that the photograph did not appear to be from India, but rather from a different event involving Chinese doctors paying tribute to a woman who had donated her organs.", "The second aspect was the comparison of the description provided in the claim with the actual content of the photograph": "The claim described doctors standing in a row with bowed heads around a dead body on a hospital bed, which did not match the content of the photograph that showed Chinese doctors paying tribute to a different individual.", "The third aspect involved checking the credibility and reliability of the sources that initially shared the photograph and made the claim": "Both Zee News and DNA were identified as the sources, and it was noted that they later deleted their tweets and revised their articles, acknowledging their mistake and expressing regret for the error.", "The fourth aspect focused on the responsibility of mainstream media to verify information before sharing it": "The expert highlighted the need for media outlets to exercise caution and conduct proper fact-checking to avoid spreading rumors or fake news, especially in emotionally charged situations. The lack of acknowledgment and correction by DNA was also noted as a concerning aspect in this case."}
