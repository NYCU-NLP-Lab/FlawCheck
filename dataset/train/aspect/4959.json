{"The claim was supported by research conducted by the Texas A": "M Transportation Institute, which has been compiling data on traffic congestion since 1984. This institute is recognized for its expertise in analyzing transportation issues and has been subject to fact-checking in the past, lending credibility to their findings.", "The verification process involved reaching out to Tim Lomax": "a senior research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, who provided insights into the methodology used to calculate the cost of traffic congestion. This expert's input helped ensure the accuracy of the calculations and added credibility to the claim.", "The four sets of numbers used to calculate the cost of traffic congestion were identified and explained": "These included the travel delay during commuting times and off-peak non-commuting times, as well as excess fuel consumption during both periods. By breaking down the calculations into these components, the authenticity of the claim was strengthened.", "A comparison was made between the institute": "s findings and the math conducted by the fact-checking team. This comparison highlighted any discrepancies and allowed for a more accurate assessment of the claim's validity. The fact-checkers found that the math worked out differently, indicating a thorough evaluation of the claim's accuracy."}
