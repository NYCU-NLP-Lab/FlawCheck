They consulted Rutgers economics professor Joseph Seneca, who stated that these measures indicated that New Jersey was adding private sector jobs at a reasonable pace.", "Examination of previous data": "The expert noted that Assemblyman Wisniewski's claim was based on figures released the previous month, which showed month-over-month decreases in total non-farm jobs in August and September.
