{"Statements from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Heidi Heitkamp": "The expert's verdict includes quotes from both Senators expressing their views on the claim. Warren criticizes the bill as a gift to big banks, while Heitkamp counters that there are no provisions that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers.", "Analysis of provisions in the bill": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are a few provisions in the bill that affect big banks, but they may not be as substantial as they seem. This analysis helps verify the claim by providing a closer look at the actual contents of the bill.", "Definition of": "big banks\" and asset thresholds: The expert's verdict explains that the financial reform law, Dodd-Frank, created regulations for banks of different asset sizes. It defines \"systemically important\" banks as those with assets above $50 billion. The bill raises the threshold to $250 billion in assets, which exempts some banks from tough regulations. This information provides context for understanding the impact of the bill on big banks.", "Expert opinion on the impact of the bill": "The expert's verdict includes the opinion of Jeremy Kress, a finance professor, who agrees that some of the small banks exempt from regulations are not actually small. This expert opinion adds credibility to the claim by supporting the argument that the bill may have unintended consequences for big banks."}
