{"The expert analyzed the city": "s pension records and compared the actual funding levels with the claim made by former Mayor Cianci. They found that in the 2001 fiscal year, the city only paid 60.6 percent of the amount needed to fund the pension program, contradicting the claim of 100 percent funding.", "The expert also examined the funding level in the following year": "2002, when Cianci claimed the pension was funded at 100 percent. However, the records showed that the actual funding level was 64.2 percent, again contradicting the claim.", "The expert noted that the funding ratio significantly increased to 80": "3 percent in the 2003 fiscal year, but this was after Cianci had left office. This indicates that the claim of two consecutive years of 100 percent funding during Cianci's tenure is not supported by the data.", "The expert compared the funding levels during Cianci": "s second administration (starting in 1991) with the earlier years, specifically from 1991 to 1994 and again in 1996. They found that during those years, the city indeed paid 100 percent of the annual required contribution, highlighting a decline in funding for the pension program in later years."}
