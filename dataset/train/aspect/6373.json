{"The misleading tweets from the Republican National Committee": "RNC) falsely claimed that a Democratic-sponsored bill would spend $54 billion taxpayer dollars on foreign countries without addressing the border crisis at home.", "The claim is based on comments made by President Donald Trump during a cabinet meeting": "where he inaccurately stated that the Democrats wanted $12 billion more in foreign aid on top of the $54 billion.", "The House bill": "which passed with support from Democrats and some Republicans, seeks $54.4 billion in funding for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs, which includes foreign assistance. This amount is consistent with the funding approved by Republican-led appropriations committees last summer.", "It is incorrect to label the entire": "54 billion as \"foreign aid\" since a significant portion, approximately $16 billion, is allocated for State Department operations."}
