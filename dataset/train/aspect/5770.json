{"The comparison presented in the claim is based on two extremely low": "resolution images that are not accurately aligned. The map purporting to show the extent of the wildfires is actually a map of \"red flag\" warnings issued by Cal Fire, which does not represent areas that have burned.", "The map used in the claim": "taken from the website America2050.org, does not match the proposed path of the California high-speed rail as shown in a more recent map produced by the California High-Speed Rail Authority in May 2016. The alignment between the two maps is far from an exact match.", "The claim implies that the wildfires were intentionally set to clear the way for the construction of the high": "speed rail. However, there is no evidence or credible source supporting this conspiracy theory.", "The wildfires in November 2018 were a historically destructive and deadly outbreak": "and attributing their occurrence to a deliberate act for the purpose of the high-speed rail project is a baseless and absurd notion."}
