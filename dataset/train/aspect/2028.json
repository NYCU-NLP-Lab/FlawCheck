{"Comparison of unemployment data": "The expert compared the change in the number of unemployed people in Harris County from January 2004 to December 2009, during the tenure of Bill White as mayor, to determine if jobs were lost. They used county data, which was not seasonally adjusted, as the city data was not available for the entire duration of White's tenure.", "Understanding of unemployment data limitations": "The expert acknowledged that unemployment data does not directly determine the number of jobs gained or lost. They consulted with a regional economist who explained that unemployment data only tracks the number of people out of work and does not account for individuals with multiple jobs or partial employment.", "Analysis of nonfarm wage and salary employment": "To determine the actual number of jobs gained or lost, the expert examined nonfarm wage and salary employment numbers for the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metropolitan area. They found that the area gained 278,700 jobs between the time White took office and when he left.", "Consideration of population growth": "The expert noted that the raw number of nonfarm jobs gained or lost does not account for population growth over time. They mentioned that Houston's population increased significantly during the same period, suggesting that the job growth should be considered relative to the population growth."}
