{"The claim falsely states that a": "second Democrat\" left the party in 24 hours due to the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "The claim refers to Rep": "Jeff Van Drew and John Yudichak, a state senator in Pennsylvania, as the Democrats who left the party. However, Van Drew's decision to leave the party was unrelated to the impeachment and had been circulating in news reports before the claim was published.", "Van Drew publicly opposed impeaching Trump and voted against both articles of impeachment": "He announced his decision to join the Republican Party after the impeachment vote.", "John Yudichak": "the state senator, left the Democratic Party a month before the claim was made. His decision to become an independent and caucus with the Republicans was motivated by his desire to change the political conversation in Pennsylvania, not by the impeachment inquiry."}
