{"The claim is based on a blog post": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a blog post titled \"Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America.\" This indicates that the claim is not supported by credible sources or official statements.", "The claim misinterprets the purpose of ICD": "9: The expert's verdict explains that the claim relies on a misinterpretation of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). The ICD-9 is a coding system used by medical professionals for billing purposes and studying causes of death. It includes a category for \"Legal execution,\" but this does not imply that execution by beheading will be implemented in America.", "Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was spread through various blog posts, but these posts were not supported by credible evidence or thorough analysis. The claim was debunked by other bloggers and experts, indicating that it lacks authenticity.", "Misleading imagery": "The expert's verdict highlights that one of the blog posts accompanying the claim included a photograph of a masked executioner swinging a sword near the neck of the condemned. This imagery is meant to evoke fear and create a false association between Obamacare and beheadings, further indicating the lack of credibility in the claim."}
