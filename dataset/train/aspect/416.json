{"The claim made by Rep": "Leonard Lance is that government debt grew by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration, equivalent to about $4 billion per day.", "The first aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim is checking the accuracy of the statistics provided by Lance": "PolitiFact New Jersey confirms that the numbers are correct, stating that publicly held debt increased by more than $3.4 trillion during the specified time period.", "The second aspect involves determining whether President Obama is solely responsible for the debt growth": "It is noted that Obama inherited the debt accumulated by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. A report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative suggests that about two-thirds of the debt growth during that time resulted from new legislation, some of which was enacted under Bush.", "The third aspect is understanding the different types of government debt": "There are two types: debt held by the public and debt held directly by the government, such as trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. It is clarified that Lance's claim refers to debt held by the public.", "The fourth aspect involves analyzing the factors contributing to debt growth": "The report by the Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative identifies the Bush tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the 2009 stimulus as three significant contributors to the debt growth during the specified period. However, it does not explicitly determine the exact responsibility of President Obama in the debt increase."}
