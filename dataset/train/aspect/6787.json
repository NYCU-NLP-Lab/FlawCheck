{"The expert mentions that the pH scale": "which measures acidity, is a logarithmic scale, meaning that a one-point drop in pH would make a substance 10 times more acidic. This is used to support the claim that the oceans have become 30 percent more acidic.", "The expert refers to sources": "both provided by Whitehouse's office and found independently, that report a decrease in the pH of surface seawater from about 8.2 to about 8.1 since the mid-18th century. This decrease in pH is cited as evidence of increased acidity in the oceans.", "The expert explains that lowering the pH by a tenth of a point corresponds to a 26": "percent rise in hydrogen ion concentration, and some sources suggest that the increase in acidity is actually closer to 30 percent. This quantitative information further supports the claim.", "The expert mentions that researchers have good measurements dating back to 1989 that directly compare carbon dioxide levels and pH": "showing a rise in ocean acidity as carbon dioxide levels have increased. This correlation between carbon dioxide and acidity provides additional evidence for the claim."}
