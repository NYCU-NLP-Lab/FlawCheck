{"The claim stated that": "TeamKraken had won \"a major injunction\" in Georgia, which was a significant aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The claim mentioned that the injunction resulted in an order to freeze all voting machines in Georgia": "further supporting the claim's authenticity.", "The expert": "s verdict highlighted the initial granting of a temporary restraining order (TRO) by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Batten, which required the impounding and preservation of voting machines in Georgia. This aspect added credibility to the claim.", "However": "the expert's verdict also emphasized that Judge Batten later reversed himself and denied the request for a TRO, stating that the voting machines in question were not under the control of the defendants in the case. This aspect contradicted the claim and cast doubt on its authenticity."}
