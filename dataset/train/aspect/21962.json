{"The expert": "s verdict states that there have only been two new assembly plants under construction or newly announced in recent years: a Toyota/Mazda joint venture plant in Alabama and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) plant in Michigan. This contradicts Trump's claim of \"many, many plants\" being built in various states.", "The expert provided a list of 12 assembly plants that have been announced in North America since 2009": "Out of those, only four were in the U.S., while eight went to Mexico and none to Canada. This further undermines Trump's claim of widespread plant construction in the U.S.", "The expert mentions that CAR": "a research group based in Michigan, tracks auto industry investments in North America. This suggests that their analysis and information are reliable sources for verifying the authenticity of claims related to the auto industry.", "Examples of specific plants that were announced and built in recent years": "such as Volvo's plant in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz's plant in South Carolina, are provided. These examples demonstrate that there have been some new plants established, but they do not support Trump's exaggerated claim of numerous plants being built across multiple states."}
