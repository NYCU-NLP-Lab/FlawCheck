{"The quote is widely attributed to Mahatma Gandhi": "The expert's verdict mentions that the quote is legendary and a quick Google image search produces numerous memes crediting Gandhi with the quote. This suggests that the widespread attribution of the quote to Gandhi is one aspect that was employed to verify its authenticity.", "Lack of evidence from Gandhi": "s own writings: The expert mentions that there is no evidence of Gandhi ever saying the quote. They refer to Dennis Dalton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University, who has extensively researched Gandhi's life and states that he knows of no source where this quotation occurs. This lack of evidence from Gandhi's own writings serves as another aspect to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical suspicion and debunking": "The expert's verdict highlights that the quote has been thought to be false for quite some time. The Christian Science Monitor listed it as one of \"The 10 most famous things never actually said\" five years ago. This historical suspicion and debunking of the quote further contribute to the verification process.", "Alternative sources and origins": "The expert mentions alternative sources and origins of similar quotes that predate the attribution to Gandhi. They refer to a 1918 speech by Nicholas Klein and a 1968 article in Women's Wear Daily attributing a similar quote to Jean Cocteau. These alternative sources and origins provide additional evidence to question the authenticity of the claim."}
