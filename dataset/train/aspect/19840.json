{"President Obama": "s previous statements: The expert's verdict mentions that President Obama had made multiple statements in the past where he claimed he did not have the legal authority to take certain actions on immigration. These statements provide evidence that supports the claim being made.", "PolitiFact": "s assessment: PolitiFact, a fact-checking organization, had previously found President Obama's statement about his position on using executive authority for immigration to be false. This assessment adds weight to the claim that Obama's position had indeed changed and he was now asserting his authority.", "Deferred action directive": "The expert's verdict mentions that in June 2012, the Obama administration issued a directive called \"deferred action\" which protected young immigrants from deportation. This demonstrates that the administration had previously used its discretionary powers to address immigration, contradicting Obama's earlier statements about the limits of his authority.", "Obama": "s announcement in 2014: The expert's verdict highlights President Obama's announcement in November 2014, where he outlined his plans to delay deportations and provide work permits for certain unauthorized immigrants. This announcement contradicts his previous statements and shows that he believed he had the authority to take further action on immigration."}
