{"Lack of substantial evidence": "The expert notes that proponents of the claim accusing Quaden Bayles of being an 18-year-old scammer provided little proof to support their allegations. This lack of substantial evidence weakens the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconclusive photographs": "The claim is supported by photographs showing Quaden Bayles standing next to the number 18 and in more \"adult\" poses. However, the expert points out that these photos were taken during his friend Garlen's 18th birthday party, and a birthday message for Garlen, not Quaden, is visible in one of the pictures. This suggests that the photographs may not accurately represent Quaden's age or intentions.", "Previous media coverage": "The expert highlights that Quaden Bayles has been in the media spotlight before, specifically in 2015 due to a bullying incident. This previous coverage indicates that Quaden's age has been publicly known and documented, further undermining the claim that he is an 18-year-old scammer.", "Social media evidence": "Quaden's mother, Yarraka Bayles, has shared numerous pictures of him on her social media accounts over the years. The expert mentions that in 2012, Yarraka posted photographs of Quaden as an infant on the beach, commenting that he was going on 15 months old. This contradicts the claim that Quaden would have been 11 years old in 2012 if he were truly 18 in 2020. The social media evidence adds credibility to Quaden's claimed age."}
