{"Jennifer Aniston publicly supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and there is no evidence to suggest that she has changed her mind and now supports Donald Trump": "2. The claim that Jennifer Aniston is starting a company named \"Celebrities for Trump\" is based on a headline from a dubious website and there is no substantial evidence to support this claim.", "A search of registered corporations and limited liability companies under the name": "Celebrities for Trump\" produced no results, indicating that no such company exists.", "Jennifer Aniston has a history of donating to Democratic candidates": "including supporting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016 and donating to help elect Barack Obama in 2008. This further contradicts the claim that she would start a pro-Trump company."}
