{"The claim is supported by an analysis of eligible voters conducted by demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution": "who found that in 2008, minorities accounted for about 26.6 percent of eligible voters, slightly more than in 2004.", "The minority share of the electorate has been growing": "as evidenced by the fact that in 2012, it grew to about 28.9 percent, and in 2016, it was about 31.1 percent.", "The documentary": "Rigged: The Voter Suppression Playbook\" highlights Republican efforts to pass laws that added voter ID rules or other restrictions after the 2008 election, suggesting an acknowledgment of the increasing influence of voters of color.", "Pew Research predicts that in 2020": "minority voters will account for an even larger share of the electorate, further supporting the claim that the number of voters of color is going up."}
