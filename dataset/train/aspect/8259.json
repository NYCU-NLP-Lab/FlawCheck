{"Multiple reputable reports and investigations confirm the existence of a CIA program called Timber Sycamore that provided training and weapons to Syrian rebels fighting against the regime of Bashar al": "Assad.", "Some of the arms provided through Timber Sycamore ended up in the hands of Islamic State fighters": "but this was unintended and not a result of deliberate policy or instructions from President Barack Obama or his administration.", "President Obama actually set up a separate program to arm and train Syrian rebels specifically to fight against Islamic State": "4. The claim that Obama ordered the CIA to train and arm Islamic State fighters originated from a 2015 article on NewsPunch, a website known for publishing junk news and sensationalist distortions of real news stories. The article cited declassified documents from the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department, which were misinterpreted to support the false claim."}
