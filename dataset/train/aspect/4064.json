{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is no evidence or credible source to support the claim. The alleged news story from Fox 10 Phoenix does not exist, and the link provided in the claim leads to the main site of KSAZ, the news station.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert highlights the inconsistencies in the story, such as the fact that poll workers supposedly witnessed the same van of people engaging in voter fraud but did not immediately report it to authorities. This raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Political bias": "The expert suggests that the claim may be politically motivated, stating that the Democratic Party benefits from voter suppression rather than voter fraud. This implies that the claim may be a tactic to discredit the Democratic Party.", "Unlikelihood of voter fraud": "The expert explains that voter fraud is extremely rare and virtually nonexistent. They provide a definition of voter fraud and contrast it with voter suppression, which is a more widespread issue. This suggests that the claim is unlikely to be true based on the rarity of voter fraud occurrences."}
