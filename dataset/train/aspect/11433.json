{"Creation date of the Facebook page": "The expert noted that the Facebook page responsible for the post was created on December 5, 2020, which is more than two months after the stated window period for applications purportedly opened. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of online record of executive order": "The expert found no online record of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signing any executive order on migration or electronic visas. This lack of official documentation casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.", "Inappropriate image used": "One of the images posted alongside the false claim showed Kaycee Madu, a Nigerian-born Canadian who was appointed as Minister of Justice and Solicitor General of the Canadian province of Alberta in August 2020. The image had nothing to do with Trudeau signing an executive order, indicating that the claim was misleading.", "Rejection of the claim by Nigerian High Commission": "The expert mentioned that there is no official mention of the purported executive order on the Nigerian High Commission's website in Canada. Instead, the commission's social media channels have rejected the claim as false. This official denial adds to the evidence against the authenticity of the claim."}
