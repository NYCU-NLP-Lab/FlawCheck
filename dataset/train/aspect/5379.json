{"Source of the claim": "The expert examined the source of the claim, which was a report titled \"Big Banks, Bonus Bonanza\" released by a coalition of five groups, led by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). The expert found the specific section in the report that mentioned the potential job creation by Bank of America if they spent their bonuses on job creation.", "Calculation methodology": "The expert analyzed the calculation methodology used in the report to arrive at the figure of 878,300 jobs. The report stated that the figure was based on a cost of $40,000 per job, although it did not explain why this specific amount was chosen. The expert verified that the calculation was done by dividing the total amount of $35.1 billion (mentioned in the Bank of America annual report) by $40,000.", "Interpretation of terms": "The expert noticed a discrepancy in the terminology used between the Facebook post and the SEIU appendix. While the Facebook post referred only to \"bonuses,\" the SEIU appendix mentioned \"bonus and compensation.\" The expert investigated and found that the $35.1 billion figure included all compensation paid by Bank of America to every employee, not just bonuses. This meant that the claim misrepresented the actual amount available for job creation.", "Confirmation from company spokesman": "The expert reached out to a company spokesman from Bank of America to confirm the accuracy of the $35.1 billion figure mentioned in the annual report. The confirmation from the company spokesman further supported the conclusion that the claim was not authentic and misrepresented the actual funds available for job creation."}
