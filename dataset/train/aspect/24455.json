{"Varying locations and number of people killed": "The expert noted that the location and number of people killed in the purported ISIS attack varied significantly in different versions of the claim. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credible news sources": "The expert pointed out that the only source reporting on the ISIS attacks was a website called World Current Events. This website was found to have nearly identical headlines for similar ISIS attacks in different locations, suggesting that its purpose was to spread fake stories. The lack of credible news sources supporting the claim undermines its authenticity.", "Contradictory and scarce details": "The expert highlighted that there were contradictory and scarce details about the ISIS attack(s). Police reported that ISIS claimed to have captured 11 army bases, which the Iraqi army denied. The lack of consistent and reliable information further questions the veracity of the claim.", "Inappropriate use of images": "The expert discovered that the images used to support the claim were unrelated to any ISIS invasion or attack. The image used for the Eugene, Oregon version of the claim was published in 2013, while the image used for the British version was taken from an unrelated news story in 2015. This manipulation of images undermines the credibility of the claim."}
