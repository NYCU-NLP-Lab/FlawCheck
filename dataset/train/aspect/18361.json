{"Graduation rate measurement": "The expert mentions that graduation rates can be measured using the federal government's cohort method, which examines how many students who enter 9th grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma. The national average graduation rate was about 81 percent in 2012-13, which is slightly higher than the claim of 80 percent.", "Comparison of per": "pupil spending: The expert refers to a 2013 Associated Press article that mentions a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). According to the OECD study using 2011 data, the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education. Four countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland) spend more than the United States per student. However, Liechtenstein, mentioned in the claim, was not included in the OECD list.", "Positive association between wealth and education spending": "The expert highlights that the federal government's National Center for Education Statistics notes a positive association between a country's wealth and expenditures per student. This suggests that countries with higher GDP tend to spend more on education.", "Common Core support and federal involvement": "The expert mentions that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush supports Common Core and opposes federal involvement in education. While not directly related to verifying the authenticity of the claim, this aspect provides context to Bush's statements and his stance on education standards."}
