{"The claim was verified by comparing the publication date of the editorial entitled": "The Black Dilemma\" with the date of its circulation online. It was found that the piece had been circulating on the internet since at least September 2014, indicating that the claim of it being published in the Baltimore Sun in June 2015 was inaccurate.", "The authenticity of the claim was further questioned when the Baltimore Sun denied ever publishing the editorial": "This denial from the newspaper provided evidence that the claim was false.", "The expert": "s verdict also pointed out the multiple authorial names that have been attached to the piece, including \"John S. Mosby,\" \"Edmund Hughes,\" and \"Ian Duncan.\" This suggests that the article has been modified and shared with different attributions, further undermining its authenticity."}
