{"Discrepancy in dates": "The expert highlighted the inconsistency in the dates mentioned in the social media messages. The image accompanying the claim showed a datestamp below Bhagat Singh's photograph as '27 Sep 1907 \u2013 23 March 1931', while the claim stated that their death anniversary falls on February 14. This contradiction raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical records and media reports": "The expert mentioned that a simple Google search reveals that the claim circulating on social media is untrue. Historical records and media reports confirm that Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were hanged in Lahore jail on March 23, 1931, after being tried in conspiracy cases. The execution was widely reported in the media, and the expert cited a specific publication, The Tribune, from March 25, 1931, with the headline \"Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev executed.\"", "Corroboration from books": "The expert referred to several books written on the martyred revolutionaries, such as Bipin Chandra's 'India's Struggle for Independence' and a book specifically on Rajguru. These books provide further evidence and corroborate the date of their execution as March 23, 1931. Quoting excerpts from these books strengthens the argument against the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical context and telegram": "The expert mentioned that on February 14, 1931, freedom fighter Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya sent a telegram to the viceroy of British India appealing to stop the execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru. This historical context supports the fact that their execution did not occur on Valentine's Day. The excerpt of the telegram, available in the book 'Revolutionaries and the British Raj,' adds credibility to the expert's verdict."}
