{"Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of a leprosy outbreak in Los Angeles in September 2019 lacks supporting evidence. The only evidence cited by the author of the claim was a paper about leprosy cases in Los Angeles, which the expert states is inaccurate and does not support the claim.", "Inaccurate information in the opinion piece": "The expert points out that the opinion piece written by Dr. Marc Siegel, which fueled the rumor of a leprosy outbreak, contains inaccurate information. The expert specifically mentions that the piece exploits two political wedge issues - immigration and homelessness - without any basis.", "Demographic factors": "The expert explains that the reason most of the leprosy cases cited in the paper were Latino patients is due to demographics. The area of Los Angeles where the clinic is located has a large Latino population, and it does not indicate any connection between immigration or homelessness and the leprosy cases.", "Contradiction with existing research": "The expert refers to a paper by Dr. Maria Teresa Ochoa, which summarizes 187 case files from L.A.'s leprosy clinic between 1973 and 2018. The paper does not warn of a looming epidemic or an increase in cases, contradicting the claim made in the opinion piece. The expert emphasizes that Mexico, which was mentioned in the claim as a potential source of leprosy cases, does not have a major public health issue with leprosy."}
