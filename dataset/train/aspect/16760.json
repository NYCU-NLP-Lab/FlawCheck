Bean enacted a ban on hiring gun owners because Michelle Obama is its main stockholder, which is false. L.L. Bean's actual CEO is Stephen Smith, and the company is privately-held with no stockholders.", "L": "L. Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. The company stays out of politics and the claim of bias against gun owners is unfounded.", "While L": "L. Bean faced a boycott in January 2017 due to a family member's donation to a Trump PAC, the company clarified that they do not support political campaigns and the boycott was misguided. In March 2018, L.L. Bean implemented a policy raising the minimum age for gun sales in their stores."}
