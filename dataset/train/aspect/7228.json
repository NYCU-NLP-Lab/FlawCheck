{"Lack of specific details": "The claim does not provide specific information about which towns were liberated or when these liberations occurred. This lack of specific details raises questions about the veracity of the claim.", "Absence of evidence": "Both the White House and ICE have not provided any evidence or named any towns that have been completely controlled by MS-13. Without any substantiation, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert opinions": "Experts on sociology and gang research have stated that they are unaware of any U.S. towns that have been wholly controlled by MS-13. They consider Trump's wording to be political hyperbole and suggest that the claim is either a gross exaggeration or a fabrication.", "Temporary impact": "According to David C. Pyrooz, an assistant professor of sociology, most gang crackdowns or raids only temporarily improve the condition of communities by reducing crime and fear. This suggests that even if some actions were taken against MS-13, the underlying factors contributing to gang presence and violence may remain unchanged."}
