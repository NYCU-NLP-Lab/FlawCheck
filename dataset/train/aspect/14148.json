This omission suggests an attempt to downplay the effects of climate change.", "Whitewashing of extreme weather events": "drought, species, and economic losses: The expert's verdict highlights that the scrubbed webpage removed information about how climate change contributes to extreme weather events, drought, species loss, and economic losses. This removal indicates an intentional disregard for these significant impacts.", "Change in title and overall tone of the webpage": "The expert's verdict mentions that the title of the webpage was changed from \"Climate Change and Wisconsin's Great Lake\" to \"The Great Lakes and a Changing World.\" Additionally, the altered webpage presents a more ambiguous stance on climate change, stating that the earth is going through a change without explicitly mentioning human-induced climate change. These changes in title and tone suggest an effort to downplay or avoid discussing climate change."}
