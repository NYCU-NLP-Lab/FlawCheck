{"The video evidence": "The expert analyzed the video that was shared along with the claim. They observed that the video showed two men slapping a statue of Mahatma Gandhi with chappals. They also noted that the video was originally uploaded on Bayside Journal in August 2015, indicating that it was not recent footage.", "Source verification": "The expert checked the source of the claim by examining the Twitter accounts that shared the video. They found that one account, named KamDev Baba, had shared the video with a message accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and calling the act its legacy. Another account, named Khabar Bar, also shared the video and directed a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take action against the culprits. The expert assessed the credibility of these accounts and their motives for sharing the video.", "Location and date verification": "The expert conducted a keyword search on Google and found multiple sources confirming that the incident in the video took place in Canada in August 2015. They found articles and videos from Bayside Journal, India.com, and other sources reporting on the incident in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This information contradicted the claim that the incident occurred in India after the BJP's electoral victory in 2019.", "Conclusion": "Based on the analysis of the video evidence, source verification, and location/date verification, the expert concluded that the claim was false. They determined that the video was a three-year-old footage of two Indian origin men slapping a statue of Gandhi in Canada, which was being falsely shared as an incident in India after the BJP's electoral victory in 2019."}
