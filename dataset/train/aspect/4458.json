{"Honey": "s production of hydrogen peroxide: The expert explains that honey naturally produces hydrogen peroxide when diluted, which contributes to its antiseptic properties. This is supported by a 2014 review paper.", "Manuka honey": "s additional antiseptic and antibiotic properties: The expert notes that research since 1989 has suggested that manuka honey, derived from bees that feed on the manuka bush, has additional antiseptic and antibiotic properties beyond hydrogen peroxide. This is attributed to a compound called methylglyoxal (MGO), which is found in higher concentrations in manuka honey compared to other honeys.", "Potential for manuka honey to fight antibiotic": "resistant bacteria: The expert mentions that viral news stories and specialty honey distributors often exaggerate the virtues of manuka honey. However, they acknowledge that research from 2010 and 2015 suggests manuka honey has the potential to fight against antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus."}
