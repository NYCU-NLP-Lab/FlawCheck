This indicates that the photo is not recent and cannot be used as evidence of his current mask-wearing practices.", "The image of Biden without a mask was originally published in Vogue magazine and was related to a story about Remi Yamamoto": "Biden's traveling national press secretary. The caption clearly states that the photo was taken in November 2019 during a flight to South Carolina. This verifies the context and timeframe of the photo.", "The claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation": "This indicates that the claim was reviewed and deemed inaccurate or misleading, further supporting the conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
