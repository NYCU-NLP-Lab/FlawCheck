{"Lack of social media and news coverage": "The expert noted that the display of lights on Trump Tower Chicago did not catch the attention of social media or news media, despite its proximity to Trump's win in South Carolina. This lack of coverage raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search and found a few identical images to the \"NO\" photo. This led to an earlier, unaltered version of the photograph. The use of a reverse image search helped verify the authenticity of the claim by finding the original source of the image.", "Identical angle and pattern of lit windows": "The expert observed that the angle and pattern of lit windows in the tower and surrounding buildings were identical in both the \"NO\" photo and the earlier version of the photograph. This similarity suggested that the \"NO\" was added using Photoshop rather than being a genuine display by the residents of Trump Tower Chicago.", "Photoshop manipulation": "Based on the identical pattern of lights on both Trump Tower Chicago and adjacent buildings, the expert concluded that the \"NO\" was likely added through Photoshop. This aspect further supported the claim's lack of authenticity and indicated that it was a political protest created artificially rather than a genuine expression of disdain by the residents."}
