{"The expert": "Justin Haskins, referred to a number of studies that support the claim that work requirements help impoverished families move from dependency to self-sufficiency. While the article does not explicitly mention these studies, it indicates that most of the analysis focused on welfare reform, with recent attention given to applying work requirements to food stamps.", "Multiple studies have been conducted since 1996": "when welfare reform was implemented, to assess the impact of work requirements. These studies provide a more restrained assessment of the effectiveness of work requirements in cutting welfare rolls and increasing employment. However, they also highlight that work requirements fell short in making people self-sufficient, with low earnings and unstable employment being common outcomes.", "The pivotal year for making work mandatory was 1996": "when Congress passed welfare reform. Welfare became a block grant program called Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), and federal cash benefits came with a lifetime limit of five years. Work participation targets were set for the states, allowing flexibility in defining what qualifies as work, including community service and job training."}
