{"The claim is based on fabricated and false information": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim regarding John McCain's responsibility for the fire aboard USS Forrestal in 1967 is regurgitated from old, fabricated accounts. The expert emphasizes that the claim is based on inaccuracies and outright lies.", "Pro": "Trump fake news websites spread the claim: The expert points out that a series of pro-Trump fake news websites played a significant role in spreading the false claim about John McCain's involvement in the fire. These websites aimed to tarnish McCain's reputation, particularly as a critic of the Trump administration.", "Lack of credible evidence": "The expert notes that the websites making the claim provide no credible evidence to support their allegations. The information they present is based on conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated rumors rather than verifiable facts.", "Contradictions and inconsistencies in the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim itself contains contradictions and inconsistencies. For example, the claim suggests that McCain deliberately caused the fire by \"wet-starting\" his aircraft, but the expert points out that this practice was common among young pilots and not exclusive to McCain. Additionally, the claim falsely states that the fire resulted in 27 deaths, while the actual number was 134."}
