{"Ayotte": "s voting record: The expert examined Ayotte's voting record and specifically looked at her votes on a budget resolution conference agreement in 2015 and a proposed amendment to it. This was done to determine if Ayotte had indeed voted for a budget that included $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants.", "Nature of the budget resolution": "The expert clarified that a budget resolution is a non-binding document that sets guidelines for the appropriations committees. It does not have the effect of law and does not initiate cuts itself. The expert emphasized that budget resolutions only set \"top-line\" numbers in broad spending categories and do not discuss appropriations to individual programs, including Pell Grants.", "Expert opinions": "The expert sought the opinions of federal budget policy experts, including Steve Ellis from Taxpayers for Common Sense and Jason Delisle from the American Enterprise Institute. These experts provided insights on the nature of budget resolutions and the difficulty in determining whether a program is being cut based on these resolutions.", "Director of the Office of Management and Budget": "s remarks: The expert mentioned that Hassan's campaign pointed to remarks made by Shaun Donovan, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who stated that the Republican's budget resolution \"eliminates roughly $90 billion in mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program.\" This statement was used as evidence to support the claim made against Ayotte's voting record."}
