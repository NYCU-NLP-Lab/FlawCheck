{"Testimony from proponents": "Proponents of the domestic partnership bill testified before the Senate committee, sharing personal stories about the challenges they faced due to not being married. This testimony provided anecdotal evidence supporting the claim that fewer people enter into marriage when domestic partnerships are available.", "Testimony from religious groups": "Members of religious groups, including Michael Sheedy from the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops, testified against the bill, arguing that it would diminish traditional marriage. Sheedy specifically claimed that in other jurisdictions where domestic partnerships were enacted, fewer people entered into marriage. This testimony provided a contrasting viewpoint and highlighted the potential impact on marriage rates.", "Lack of specific examples in the United States": "When questioned by Sen. Jeff Clemens about examples in the United States, Sheedy admitted that he could not think of any off the top of his head. This lack of specific examples raised doubts about the claim's applicability to the United States context and suggested that further evidence was needed to support it.", "Lack of data supporting the claim": "In a subsequent phone conversation, Sheedy acknowledged not finding data about the claim's occurrence in the United States. While he provided links to information about the effect of gay marriage laws on traditional marriage in Spain and the Netherlands, the absence of data specifically related to the claim in the United States weakened its credibility and verifiability."}
