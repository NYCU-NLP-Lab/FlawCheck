{"The images in the claim depict street clashes between uniformed police or soldiers and protesters": "suggesting a violent interaction between law enforcement and demonstrators.", "The superimposed captions on the images claim that they show police violence in Hong Kong": "creating a narrative of excessive force and brutality.", "The text accompanying the images": "translated from traditional Chinese script, further reinforces the claim by alleging the use of water cannons, attacks on journalists and women, and the throwing of stones by Hong Kong police.", "An analysis of the photos reveals that they are not from Hong Kong or related to the recent protests there": "Instead, they have been circulating online for some time and were taken in Europe, primarily in France. This fact undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
