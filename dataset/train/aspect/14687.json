{"The expert acknowledges that the claim made by U": "S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg is technically correct since 2001, as guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil during that period.", "The expert points out that the comparison made by Lautenberg between the number of gun": "related deaths in the U.S. and the number of military casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan is flawed and misleading. The expert uses the analogy of comparing pickle consumption in New York City and Rhode Island to highlight the flawed nature of the comparison.", "The expert cites data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation": "FBI) Uniform Crime Report program, which shows that more than 8,700 people were murdered in the United States with firearms in 2010. The expert also refers to FBI data indicating that more than 95,000 people have been murdered with a gun in the United States since 2001.", "The expert suggests that while the FBI data does not include citizenship status": "it is reasonable to assume that the majority of murder victims are U.S. citizens. This implies that the claim made by Lautenberg applies to American citizens specifically."}
