{"Rumors and anecdotes": "The expert mentions that the claim about Aquafina bottled water not freezing has been circulating on internet forums and blogs for over a decade. These rumors are usually presented anecdotally, without any concrete evidence.", "The 2016 YouTube video": "The expert highlights a specific YouTube video titled \"AQUAFINA DOESN'T FREEZE. Why? Antifreeze.. (maybe too, radio-active..)\" that gained attention and was posted on conspiracy-focused websites. The video shows unfrozen bottles of Aquafina surrounded by frozen bottles of other water brands. However, the expert points out that this video does not provide any evidence to support the claim.", "Supercooled water explanation": "The expert explains the concept of supercooled water, where pure water can remain in a liquid state below its freezing point if it is slowly cooled without disturbance and contains no impurities. This is suggested as a possible explanation for Aquafina appearing unfrozen under certain conditions.", "Contaminants in opened bottles": "The expert refutes the supercooled water explanation for the specific YouTube video mentioned earlier, stating that the opened bottles are likely to contain contaminants that would serve as nuclei for ice crystals. This suggests that the claim about Aquafina not freezing in the video is not valid."}
