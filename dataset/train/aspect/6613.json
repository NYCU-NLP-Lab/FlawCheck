{"The claim was debunked by multiple sources": "including experts who quickly pointed out that the image in question was actually a schematic of a circuit for a BOSS MT-2 Metal Zone electric guitar pedal, not a \"COVID 5G Chip\" as claimed by conspiracy theorists.", "The schematic featured terms and labels that were familiar to guitarists": "such as \"MT-2 Gain\" and \"Footswitch,\" further indicating its connection to a guitar pedal rather than a microchip for COVID-19 tracking.", "Mario Fusco": "a senior software engineer at Redhat, identified the misinformation and flagged it on Twitter, contributing to the verification process.", "The end product incorporating the circuit shown in the schematic was unrelated to COVID": "19, non-micro in size, and had a completely different appearance, further discrediting the claim."}
