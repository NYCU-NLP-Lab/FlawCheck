Chelsea Clinton is wearing different dresses in the still photograph and the video, and Bill Clinton is seen wearing different shirts and ties.", "Change in Bill Clinton": "s attire: The expert specifically mentions the change in Bill Clinton's attire between the photograph and the video. He was wearing a light blue shirt with a dark blue and white tie on Election Day, but in the video, he is seen wearing a white shirt with a salmon-colored tie.", "Inconsistency with the narrative": "The expert questions the narrative behind the claim, stating that it doesn't add up. Given Clinton's confidence heading into the election and the polls showing her with a large advantage, it is unlikely that a moment of jubilation would occur on election night after losing."}
