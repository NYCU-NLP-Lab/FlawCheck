This suggests that the claim is not authentic or accurate.", "Reliability of Russian media reports": "The expert questions the reliability of the reports from Russian state media outlets, RT.com and Sputnik, which initially reported the incident at the NATO base. The expert suggests that these outlets may have exaggerated the story, potentially for political purposes.", "Confirmation from Turkish authorities": "The expert mentions that Turkish authorities dismissed the speculation of a second coup and explained that the police presence at the NATO base was for safety inspections ahead of a U.S. military official's visit.
