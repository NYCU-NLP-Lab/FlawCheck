{"The claim is in response to a statement made by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Daniel Biss attacking the tax transparency of JB Pritzker and Chris Kennedy": "stating that they had released no more information about their personal finances than Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.", "Illinois Gov": "Bruce Rauner's campaign ran an ad questioning whether Pritzker was an \"incompetent investor\" or \"stashing his cash overseas\" and \"refusing to pay his fair share\" of taxes, without providing any proof for these claims.", "Pritzker stated that he had released": "way more information\" about his taxes than Rauner, emphasizing that Rauner made his money by cutting jobs and buying companies and firing people.", "Rauner has a history of releasing only hazy outlines of his annual earnings and taxes paid through 1040 tax forms": "while previous candidates for the state's top office had voluntarily disclosed the entire contents of their tax returns for transparency."}
