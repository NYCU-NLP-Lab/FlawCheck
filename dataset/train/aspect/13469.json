{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Antifa is planning to move into residential areas. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "No local reports or tweets": "The expert's investigation found no tweets from local Antifa cells or local news reports about protests moving into residential areas on the specific date mentioned in the claim. This further questions the validity of the claim.", "No official Twitter account": "The expert highlights that Antifa does not have a national organization or an official Twitter account. This fact makes it unlikely that a tweet from an account called \"ANTIFA America\" would represent the entire movement.", "Misinformation spread": "The expert mentions that misinformation about Antifa started spreading on social media platforms after President Donald Trump blamed the movement for violent protests. This context suggests that the claim could be part of the misinformation campaign rather than a genuine statement from Antifa."}
