{"Donald Trump Jr": "s tweet: The claim was initially made by Donald Trump Jr. in a tweet where he questioned the sharp drop in influenza-related deaths this year compared to the previous flu season. This tweet was widely shared and caught the attention of many people.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that neither Donald Trump Jr. nor Tyler Zed, the user who shared the tweet on Facebook, provided any evidence to support their claim. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous fact": "checks: USA TODAY has previously debunked claims suggesting that different flu seasons were deadlier than the COVID-19 pandemic. These fact-checks have determined that COVID-19 is deadlier than previous flu seasons, including the 2018-2019 flu season, the 1918 Spanish flu, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. This information contradicts the claim being made.", "CDC data": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have not stopped reporting flu deaths as COVID-19 has ravaged the country. The expert's verdict mentions that CDC data does not support Trump's claim. The CDC releases weekly U.S. influenza summary updates from October through May, and their first report for the 2020-2021 flu season was posted for the week ending Oct. 3. This suggests that the CDC is actively monitoring and reporting flu deaths, contradicting the claim that they may be misreporting them."}
