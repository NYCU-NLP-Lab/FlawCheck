{"The claim was debunked by an expert who analyzed the origins of the information and found that it originated from a satirical blog called America": "s Last Line of Defense.", "The expert identified that the accompanying photograph used in the claim was actually taken from a news story by KUOW": "FM, a public radio station in Seattle, about an \"Ask a Muslim\" event in August 2016. This showed that the image was unrelated to the claim and was used without permission.", "The expert highlighted that the person seen in the photograph": "Mohamed Bakr, is a Muslim, but he is not the superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools. The actual superintendent is Meria Joel Carstarphen, who has held the position since 2014.", "The expert also mentioned that the satirical nature of America": "s Last Line of Defense was evident from a disclaimer on their Facebook page, which stated that nothing on the page is real and that it consists of satirical content created by liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. This disclaimer further confirmed the inauthenticity of the claim."}
