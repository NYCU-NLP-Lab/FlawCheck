{"Lack of verbatim quote": "The expert's investigation revealed that there was no verbatim quote from Arnold Schwarzenegger stating, \"I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??\" This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unreliable source": "The claim originated from a website called the Colorado Post, which does not appear to be affiliated with the reputable newspaper Denver Post. The lack of credibility of the source raises concerns about the accuracy of the claim.", "Ineligibility for presidency": "The expert pointed out that Schwarzenegger is not eligible for the U.S. presidency as he is not a natural-born U.S. citizen, having been born in Austria. This fact contradicts the claim that he would be running for president in 2020.", "Lack of context and evidence": "The article from Colorado Post did not provide any information on when or where Schwarzenegger supposedly made the statement. Furthermore, the article primarily focused on the causes and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, with only a passing mention of Schwarzenegger's dislike for Trump. This lack of context and supporting evidence weakens the credibility of the claim."}
