{"Use of statistics": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Jean Schmidt claimed that for every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion. The expert's investigation involved examining the statistics provided by anti-abortion organizations and comparing them to the fact sheet from Planned Parenthood.", "Source verification": "The expert's investigation involved checking the sources referred to by Rep. Jean Schmidt, including anti-abortion organizations such as Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Liberty Counsel Action, Family Research Council Action, and the Chiaroscuro Foundation. The expert verified the claims made by these organizations and cross-referenced them with the fact sheet from Planned Parenthood.", "Examination of context": "The expert's verdict highlights the political context in which the claim was made, mentioning the debate over funding for Planned Parenthood and the arguments put forth by Democrats and Republicans. By considering the broader context, the expert was able to assess the motivations behind the claim and evaluate its authenticity.", "Evaluation of assumptions": "The expert's investigation pointed out the problems with the calculation used to arrive at the 98 percent figure. It highlighted the assumption that pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of the three options (abortion, adoption referral, or prenatal care). By critically evaluating this assumption, the expert raised doubts about the accuracy of the claim."}
