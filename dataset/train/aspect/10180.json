{"Obama": "s accusation: The expert mentions that Sen. Barack Obama accused Sen. John McCain of hiring some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign. This accusation serves as the initial claim that needs to be verified for authenticity.", "Documentation of ties": "The expert highlights that the McCain campaign's ties to current or former lobbyists have been well-documented. This documentation includes disclosures about the lobbyists' clients and their departures from the campaign. These documented ties serve as evidence to support the claim.", "Conflict policy implementation": "The McCain campaign instituted a \"conflict policy\" on May 15, 2008, stating that no federal lobbyists would be kept on the campaign's payroll. This policy serves as a response to the claim and is presented as a measure taken by the campaign to address the issue.", "Former lobbyists on the campaign": "Despite the conflict policy, the expert mentions that the McCain campaign still has former lobbyists involved, some of whom left their lobbying firms or took unpaid leave before joining the campaign. This aspect raises questions about the effectiveness of the conflict policy and suggests that the claim might have some validity."}
