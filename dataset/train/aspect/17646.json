{"Documentation from Congressional Research Service": "CRS): The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Suzanne Bonamici's claim was based on information from a CRS analysis of the Violence Against Women Act. The CRS is a nonpartisan research arm of Congress that provides detailed and rigorous analysis of issues and legislation. This documentation serves as an important aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Definition of domestic violence": "The expert's verdict explains that to understand the claim, one must first understand the definition of domestic violence. The Justice Department, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Department of Defense provide precise definitions that include sexual violence, stalking, and intimate partner violence. This aspect helps in clarifying the scope of what is considered as domestic violence.", "Landmark study by the CDC": "The expert's verdict mentions a 2010 study conducted by the CDC, which is also referenced by the CRS. This study provides statistics on domestic violence, including sexual violence and severe physical violence. The study's findings support the claim made by Rep. Bonamici, adding credibility to her statement.", "Statistics on severe physical violence": "The expert's verdict highlights a specific statistic mentioned in the CDC report's executive summary. It states that approximately 1 in 4 women (24.3%) and 1 in 7 men (13.8%) have experienced severe physical violence. This statistic directly aligns with Rep. Bonamici's claim and serves as evidence for the authenticity of her statement."}
