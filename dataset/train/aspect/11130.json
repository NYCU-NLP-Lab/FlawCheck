{"The claim falsely states that Joe Biden was supposed to deliver his first State of the Union address by Feb": "20, without providing any evidence or official statement to support this timeline.", "The U": "S. Constitution does not set a specific timeline for the president to deliver the State of the Union address, stating only that the president should provide Congress with information on the state of the union \"from time to time.\"", "It is a common practice for presidents to not deliver an official State of the Union address during their inauguration year": "The last six presidents have followed this tradition, as confirmed by the Congressional Research Service.", "The ratification of the 20th Amendment changed the opening time for congressional sessions": "moving the State of the Union address from December to January and February. Therefore, the claim's assertion of a specific date (Feb. 20) for Biden's address is unfounded."}
