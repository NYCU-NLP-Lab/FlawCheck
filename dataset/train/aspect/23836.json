{"Lack of public estimate": "There is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas as there is no law requiring them to be reported. This makes it difficult to determine the exact amount of untaxed corporate earnings sitting offshore.", "Examination of financial statements": "Researchers can analyze the indefinitely reinvested earnings on financial statements of publicly traded companies to get an idea of the amount of untaxed foreign revenue. These earnings are not repatriated to the United States, allowing companies to avoid taxes and increase after-tax profits.", "Nonpublic information": "The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has access to total untaxed foreign earnings, but this information is only shared with members of Congress. The committee's last public findings in 2016 stated that $2.3 trillion of foreign earnings went untaxed, with an estimated $2.6 trillion for 2015.", "Corroborating sources": "The committee cited Audit Analytics, a third-party research service, to support their findings. Audit Analytics discovered $2.4 trillion in indefinitely reinvested earnings, slightly differing from the committee's estimate."}
