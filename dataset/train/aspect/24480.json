{"Comparison of complication rates": "The expert's verdict includes a comparison of the complication rates between abortions and vasectomies. It mentions that according to a Texas Tribune news story, fewer than 1 percent of Texas abortions in 2014 resulted in any complication to the woman. On the other hand, a 2006 article by two Kentucky physicians suggests that the incidence of complications from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent.", "Citing official sources": "The expert's verdict cites official sources to support the claim. It mentions that the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the complication rate for abortions in Texas, and it refers to a study published in the American Family Physician journal for information on vasectomy complications.", "Use of statistics and data": "The expert's verdict relies on statistical data to verify the claim. It provides specific numbers, such as the decrease in the number of abortions in Texas and the percentage of complications from vasectomies, to support the argument.", "Lack of data on vasectomy complications": "The expert's verdict also highlights the lack of available data on complications from vasectomies. It mentions that the state doesn't track fall-out from vasectomies, which suggests that there may be limited information on the safety of the procedure compared to abortions."}
