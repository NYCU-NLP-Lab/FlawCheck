{"The claim states that Jessica King": "voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is a review of the Oshkosh city budgets for 2009 and 2010, which showed an increase in pay appropriated for the seven council members by 63.8 percent.", "The second aspect involves examining the official minutes and ordinance from an April 8": "2008 Oshkosh council meeting. The council voted, 4-3, to double the mayor's salary and increase the salary of each council member by 56 percent. Jessica King, however, voted against these raises, stating that salaries should be reviewed by a citizen committee.", "The third aspect considered is the statement of the Hopper campaign spokesman": "Sean Stephenson, who claimed that King voted for the 2009 and 2010 city budgets, which included the pay increase. This suggests that her vote indirectly supported the raise.", "The fourth aspect involves the response from the King campaign spokeswoman": "Gillian Morris, who pointed to the vote on the pay raise ordinance as evidence that King opposed the raises and advocated for citizen committee review. This contradicts the claim made by the Hopper campaign."}
