{"The claim being examined is that": "More Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history.\"", "The expert": "s verdict states that there is no useful statistic for \"Americans who have lost their jobs\" during a given time period, as the labor force is fluid and people who lose their jobs often find new employment quickly. Instead, economists use the concept of net jobs gained or lost.", "The expert confirms that the Romney campaign was referring to net jobs lost under a given president": "which is the measure used to verify the claim.", "When analyzing the net job change from inauguration day until the end of the presidency": "it is found that Obama is the only president to have a net job loss. However, it is noted that it may not be fair to credit or blame presidents for jobs created or lost during their first year in office, as their policies have not had sufficient time to take effect. Using a different method that starts one year into a president's term, it is revealed that the Obama administration actually presided over a net increase in jobs."}
