{"The claim made by Donald Trump that heroin pours across the southern borders is supported by evidence from various sources": "including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House's page on the international heroin market.", "The primary sources of heroin in the United States are Mexico and South America": "as confirmed by the DEA and the White House. These regions dominate the U.S. heroin market due to their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to meet the demand.", "Data from the DEA report shows a consistent prevalence of heroin from the southern border over the past two decades": "This is further supported by the increase in Mexican heroin's market share, accounting for a significant proportion of the total weight of heroin seized and analyzed by the DEA.", "The cultivation of poppy fields in Mexico has seen a significant increase in recent years": "indicating a growing production and distribution of heroin. This is reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown within Mexico itself."}
