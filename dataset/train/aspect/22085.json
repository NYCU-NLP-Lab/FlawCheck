{"The Facebook post featuring the photo of a young girl with a caption claiming it shows Okonjo": "Iweala as the new WTO Director-General.", "The confirmation from the photographer": "Allen Coleman, who stated that the photo was part of a series called 'EYES' and was taken between 2013 and 2015. He also explicitly denied that the photo was of Okonjo-Iweala.", "The analysis of the image using the open": "source tool InVID WeVerify, which revealed that the photo was taken on July 28, 2014, and edited a few days later, further supporting Coleman's claim.", "The fact that Okonjo": "Iweala was born in 1954, making her 60 years old in 2014, which contradicts the claim that the photo shows her as a young girl."}
