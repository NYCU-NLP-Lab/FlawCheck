{"The Texas Supreme Court ruling in May 2016 confirmed the claim about the performance of Texas students": "stating that the percentage of students meeting college readiness standards in English and math increased from 28% and 42% respectively before 2005, to 65% and 66% in 2013.", "The figures presented in the claim align with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency": "TEA). The TEA confirmed that in 2004, 29% of students met college readiness standards in English, and 43% did so in math. In 2013, 65% of students met readiness standards in English, and 66% did so in math. These percentages steadily increased over the years.", "The Texas Success Initiative": "a program implemented by the TEA, assesses the readiness of high school students by evaluating their performance on the state-mandated English language arts and math exams. The percentages mentioned in the claim reflect the share of students meeting the expectations set by this initiative.", "The readiness standards for college remained consistent between 2004 and 2013": "requiring students to achieve specific scale scores on the relevant exams, including a 3 out of 4 on the writing portion of the English test. This suggests that the increase in the percentage of students meeting college readiness standards was not due to a loosening of standards."}
