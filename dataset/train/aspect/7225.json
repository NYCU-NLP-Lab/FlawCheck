{"The ad claims that under Barack Obama": "the U.S. now has the \"lowest workforce since (President Jimmy) Carter.\" The expert points out that there are contradictions within the ad itself, as it mentions both \"31 years\" and the reference to Carter, which cannot both be correct. This raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "The term": "lowest workforce\" used in the ad is also questioned by the expert. The term \"workforce\" refers to the absolute number of people who are either employed or seeking work. The expert argues that this claim is inaccurate due to the overall population growth and the increase in women's participation in the workforce over the last three decades.", "The expert suggests that the American Future Fund": "the group behind the ad, may have been referring to a different statistic called the civilian labor force participation rate. This statistic takes into account the size of the nation's population. The expert wonders if this was the intended meaning of the claim.", "When looking at the labor force participation rate": "the expert acknowledges that the ad is not far off from the truth. However, the expert does not provide a definitive answer on the accuracy of the claim, leaving room for further investigation and interpretation."}
