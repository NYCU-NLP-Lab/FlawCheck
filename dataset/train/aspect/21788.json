{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no historical evidence or documentation to support the claim that a Muslim regiment of the Indian Army refused to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan. The absence of any official records or credible sources undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification through official sources": "The expert's investigation involved checking official records and reports from reputable sources such as ABP News, Jagran Josh, Times of India, and BBC News Hindi. These sources consistently state that there was never a Muslim regiment in the Indian Army, providing further evidence against the claim.", "Expert testimonies": "The expert's verdict includes quotes from two retired military officers, Lieutenant General (Retd.) Syed Ata Hasnain and Major General (Retd.) Shashi Asthana. Both experts categorically deny the existence of a Muslim regiment in the Indian Army and label the claim as propaganda. Their expertise and knowledge in military affairs lend credibility to their statements.", "Longstanding debunking": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim has been circulating online since 2017 and has been repeatedly debunked by fact-checkers. The fact that the claim has been consistently refuted over several years indicates that it lacks credibility and is likely a baseless rumor or misinformation."}
