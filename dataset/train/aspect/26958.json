{"Multiple instances of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim of the global COVID-19 death toll exceeding 1.6 million has been circulated in various posts across different countries and regions, including Nigeria, Ghana, Burundi, and the Philippines. This indicates that the claim has gained widespread attention and has been shared multiple times.", "Reposting with different formats": "The claim has been reposted in different formats, including the use of images featuring popular Nigerian movie stars and variations in the text accompanying the claim. This suggests that the claim has been modified and adapted to suit different audiences and platforms, potentially indicating a lack of authenticity.", "Lack of source citation": "The posts and social media accounts sharing the claim do not mention any specific source for their claims. This absence of a credible source raises doubts about the reliability and accuracy of the information being presented.", "Concerns about undercounting official death tolls": "The expert's verdict mentions concerns raised by The Economist regarding the undercounting of official death tolls by governments in many parts of the world. This highlights the challenges in accurately documenting COVID-19 fatalities and suggests that the claim of a global death toll exceeding 1.6 million may be higher than the officially reported figures."}
