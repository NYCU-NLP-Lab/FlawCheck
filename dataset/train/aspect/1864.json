{"The claim is based on an article published by the website Got News": "which reported that Summer Zervos was paid $500,000 to fabricate her sexual harassment claim against Donald Trump.", "The source of this information is an unidentified anonymous source": "as mentioned in the article. No further evidence or corroboration is provided.", "Gloria Allred": "Zervos' attorney, vehemently denies the claim, calling it a \"malicious lie\" and threatening to hold those responsible accountable.", "There is a contradiction between the claim and the fact that Zervos had discussed her encounters with Trump with a friend and social worker": "Ann Russo, more than five years ago, long before Trump's presidential campaign. This suggests that Zervos' allegations were not fabricated for political gain."}
