{"Voter approval in November 2010": "The expert mentions that 72 percent of voters supported the idea of creating a library district in November 2010. This indicates that there was a significant level of support for the concept at that time.", "Measure 26": "114: The expert explains that Measure 26-114 was put on the ballot in early 2010, which allowed county commissioners to seek voter approval for creating a permanent library tax district in the future.

This aspect highlights that the measure was presented to voters as a technical change rather than a definitive decision on creating a library district.", "Support from local librarians": "The expert quotes local librarians who argued in favor of Measure 26-114, stating that it would protect and ensure library funding in the future. This support from professionals in the field adds credibility to the claim that voters were supportive of the idea of a library district."}
