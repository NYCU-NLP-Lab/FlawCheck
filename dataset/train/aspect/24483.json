{"The Facebook post and caption": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a Facebook post, which stated that a man had suffered a heart attack and died at work, and his coworkers took a photo with his body, thinking he had fallen asleep. This post and its accompanying caption provide the initial information for the investigation.", "Reverse image search": "The expert used a reverse image search on Google, which led them to a 2016 CBC News article that included the same photo. The article identified the sleeping man as Eduard Paraschivescu and mentioned that he had fallen asleep on his second day at a company called GSOFT. This verification through a reputable news source adds credibility to the claim.", "Confirmation from Eduard Paraschivescu": "The expert reached out to Eduard Paraschivescu via Facebook Messenger, and he confirmed the incident in February 2016. Paraschivescu stated, \"I'm very much alive, thanks for checking up on me.\" This direct confirmation from the person involved in the claim provides strong evidence of its authenticity.", "Presence on Reddit and meme creation": "The expert discovered that Paraschivescu himself had posted the image on Reddit. Although the image was later removed, it had been picked up by the subReddit r/PhotoshopBattles, where people use image manipulation software to create new and funny images. This indicates that the photo had gained attention and was being shared and modified, further supporting the claim's authenticity."}
