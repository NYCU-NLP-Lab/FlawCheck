{"The claim is supported by multiple sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was reported by various sources such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, Miami Herald, and Austin American-Statesman. These sources provide evidence of the claim being widely discussed and reported on.", "The claim is based on the Texas GOP platform": "The expert's verdict includes the complete wording of the \"Knowledge-Based Education\" plank from the 2012 Texas GOP platform. This plank explicitly opposes the teaching of critical thinking skills and similar programs.", "Confirmation from party officials": "The expert's verdict mentions that the party's deputy executive director, Chris Elam, stated that the platform subcommittee did not intend to indicate opposition to critical thinking skills. However, the party chairman, Steve Munisteri, clarified in an interview that the platform plank is against a specific type of teaching called \"outcome-based education\" and that critical thinking is mentioned because some places try to disguise outcome-based education as critical thinking.", "Early discussions and satirization": "The expert's verdict mentions that major liberal websites and media outlets, including Comedy Central's \"Colbert Report,\" launched assaults on this part of the 2012 platform as early as June 26. This indicates that the claim was widely discussed and criticized before the expert's analysis."}
