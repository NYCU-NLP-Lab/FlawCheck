{"Inconsistencies in the source": "The expert noted that the claim originated from unreliable websites, Departed.co and MyFreshNews.com, which falsely attributed the information to MSNBC. These websites have a history of publishing hoax news reports and misleading information, raising doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credible news reports": "The expert found that the claim did not appear in any credible news sources. Despite the magnitude of the alleged event, no reputable news outlets reported on the bombing, indicating that the claim was likely fabricated.", "Repurposed photographs": "Upon further investigation, the expert discovered that the featured image used in the articles was not related to the claimed California music festival bombing. Instead, the photograph was repurposed from a March 2016 bombing in Istanbul, Turkey. This discrepancy raised suspicions about the accuracy of the claim.", "Non": "existent music festival: The expert confirmed that there were no large music festivals taking place in California on the date mentioned in the claim. This fact strongly contradicted the assertion that 106 people were killed in an ISIS bombing at a music festival, further discrediting the claim's authenticity."}
