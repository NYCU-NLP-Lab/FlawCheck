{"Repetition of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim of women earning 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position has been repeated by politicians, news organizations, and even President Obama. This repetition indicates that the claim has gained acceptance and credibility over time.", "Source of the claim": "The expert refers to U.S. Rep. David Cicilline as the source of the claim. Cicilline made the statement in a news release supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act. The expert also mentions that Cicilline's office referred to a 2011 Census report to support the claim.", "Criticism and counterarguments": "The expert highlights that the claim has been criticized by Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos, who argues that factors such as differences in work hours and career choices between men and women contribute to the wage gap. Castellanos suggests that if the wage difference were significant, businesses would hire only women to save money.", "Lack of job": "by-job comparison: The expert points out that the claim does not provide a job-by-job comparison of men and women's earnings. Instead, it refers to a general statistic from the Census report that applies to full-time, year-round workers. This aspect raises questions about the accuracy and specificity of the claim."}
