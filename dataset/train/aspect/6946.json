{"The claim was verified by examining the historical data on earmarks and pet projects during the period when Republicans": "including Mr. Boehner, were in charge. This involved analyzing the number of earmarks and pet projects during the Republican-controlled Congresses from 1995 to 2006.", "The expertise of Taxpayers for Common Sense": "a nonpartisan advocacy group that fights wasteful spending in Congress, was consulted to verify the claim. The group's vice president, Steve Ellis, confirmed that there was a significant increase in earmarks during the Republican-controlled Congresses, supporting the claim made by President Obama.", "The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service was referenced as another source that documented the increasing earmarks during the specified period": "Their report, \"Earmarks in Appropriation Bills,\" provided further evidence to support the claim.", "The overall context of President Obama": "s speech and his intent to highlight the differences between Democrats and Republicans on economic policies was taken into account. The claim was evaluated within the broader argument being made by the President, suggesting that the Republicans' focus on tax cuts for the wealthy and limited government spending was not supported by their track record on earmarks and pet projects."}
