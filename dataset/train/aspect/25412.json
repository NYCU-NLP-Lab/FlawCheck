{"The claim was made by Austan Goolsbee": "the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Barack Obama, during an interview on ABC's \"This Week with Christiane Amanpour.\" This establishes the source of the claim and the context in which it was made.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics": "the government's official source for employment numbers, was consulted to verify the claim. This demonstrates the use of a reliable and authoritative data source to assess the accuracy of the claim.", "Two different approaches were employed to analyze the manufacturing employment data": "looking at the January-to-May figures and projecting the full-year totals based on the current pace. This indicates a comprehensive examination of the data from different perspectives to ensure a thorough evaluation.", "The analysis of the manufacturing employment data revealed that in 2011": "the manufacturing sector had gained 76,000 jobs from January to May, which was the highest increase in 17 years. Additionally, if the current pace continued, manufacturing jobs were projected to increase by 182,000 for the full year. These specific statistics provide quantitative evidence to support the claim made by Goolsbee."}
