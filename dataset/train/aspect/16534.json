{"Statistics on auto imports and exports": "The expert looked at the numbers compiled by the U.S. Commerce Department, which showed that the United States exported 16,659 vehicles to Korea in 2010, while Korea exported 515,646 vehicles to the United States. This data supported the claim that there is a significant trade imbalance in the auto industry.", "Population imbalance": "The expert acknowledged that South Korea has a smaller population than the United States, but noted that the disparity in auto sales is much larger than the population ratio. This aspect further supported the claim of a trade imbalance.", "Expert opinions": "The expert consulted with experts who confirmed that there is a significant trade imbalance in the auto industry between the United States and South Korea. They also agreed that South Korea has a better deal in the trading relationship. This expert consensus strengthened the authenticity of the claim.", "Qualifications and exceptions": "The expert pointed out that there are some qualifications and exceptions to the claim. For example, there are not clear categories of American cars and Korean cars, as some Korean-branded cars are manufactured in the United States. Additionally, General Motors owns a Korean auto company, and some Korean-made cars are sold in Korea under American brands. These qualifications provided a balanced perspective but did not negate the overall validity of the claim."}
