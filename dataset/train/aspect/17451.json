{"The National Voter Registration Act requires states to offer voter registration information at offices that provide public assistance and at armed services recruitment offices": "2. H.R. 1 would expand the role government offices play in registering voters, requiring applicants to \"opt out\" instead of \"opt in\" for voter registration.", "H": "R. 1 does not single out people seeking public assistance but would broadly require government agencies to help eligible individuals register to vote.", "The claim that H": "R. 1 automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote is misleading, as the bill aims to expand voter registration efforts for eligible individuals across various government agencies."}
