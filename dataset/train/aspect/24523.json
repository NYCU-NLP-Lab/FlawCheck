{"McAuliffe": "s statement fails to mention that the research looked at all gun transactions, including gifts and inheritances, not just sales. When one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig, analyzed the data specifically for sales, he found that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check.", "The 1997 study cited by McAuliffe is considered old and limited": "as it is based on data from 1994. This raises questions about the current accuracy and relevance of the statistics.", "It is important to note that the 1994 data used in the study did not include a category for online sales": "indicating that the estimate of 40 percent of guns being sold online may not be supported by the available research."}
