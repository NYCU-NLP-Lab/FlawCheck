{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that when asked for evidence that wind turbine noise causes cancer, the White House did not provide any. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Australian Select Committee findings": "The expert mentions that the Australian parliament formed a Select Committee on Wind Turbines to investigate the health impact of wind turbines. The committee found that while personal reports of discomfort were common, there was no evidence linking wind turbine noise to cancer or any specific illness.", "Australian Medical Association": "s stance: The expert cites the Australian Medical Association, which stated that the available evidence does not support the belief that wind turbine noise causes adverse health effects, including cancer. This endorsement from a reputable medical association adds credibility to the argument against the claim.", "Scientific review on annoyance": "not cancer: The expert refers to a 2014 review published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which found associations between living near wind turbines and annoyance.
