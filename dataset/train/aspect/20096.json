{"Educational attainment data": "The experts suggest that the best measure to determine the \"most educated\" states is the educational attainment data compiled by the census bureau. This data provides information on the percentage of residents, aged 25 and over, who have at least a bachelor's degree.", "High school graduation rate": "The claim is supported by citing a 2009 news article by U.S. News & World Report, which stated that New Jersey had the highest high school graduation rate in 2006. This indicates that a significant number of New Jersey residents successfully completed their high school education.", "College degree percentage": "The claim is also supported by citing a Huffington Post article that claimed New Jersey ranked sixth for the percentage of adults between 25 and 34 years old with college degrees. This suggests that a considerable proportion of young adults in New Jersey have attained a college degree.", "Student achievement and college graduation rates": "The claim is further supported by stating that New Jersey has the nation's highest high school graduation rate and ranks at the top in student achievement and college graduation rates. This indicates that New Jersey residents not only complete their education but also perform well academically and successfully graduate from college."}
