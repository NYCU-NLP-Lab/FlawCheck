{"The claim is based on an article published on the website PoliticusUSA in August 2015": "which states that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) document included a \"quiet\" admission about marijuana killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells.", "The National Cancer Institute": "NCI) maintains a database called Physician Data Query (PDQ) on \"Cannabis and Cannabinoids.\" This PDQ report is regularly updated and contains comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on various cancer-related topics, including potential anti-tumor effects of cannabis.", "Both the pre": "update and post-update versions of the PDQ report mentioned laboratory and animal studies suggesting potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis. They also included phrases that could be loosely interpreted as \"marijuana kills cancer,\" although this interpretation is false and misleading.", "The earliest archived version of the NIH cannabis PDQ is from November 2014": "and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis are identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. This indicates that the information about cannabis and its potential anti-tumor effects has been present in the PDQ report for a considerable period of time, and there was no specific \"admission\" made in the 2015 update."}
