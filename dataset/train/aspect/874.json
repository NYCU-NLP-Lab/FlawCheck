{"The photograph was taken by photographer Bruce Omori off the coast of Hawaii in 2009 and won the 2012 Power of Nature Windland Smith Rice International Award": "2. The photographer described the scene as lava pouring into the ocean, creating a huge escape of steam and multiple vortices spinning off the plume.", "Another photographer": "Leigh Hilbert, confirmed the existence of these lava-induced steam vortices and described them as spinning columns of steam sucked out of the super-heated vortex of broiling plume steam.", "The phenomenon of steam vortices formed when lava comes in contact with water is caused by chemical and geological reactions": "resulting in the production of sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, ash, tephra, black sand, glass particles, and extremely hot steam."}
