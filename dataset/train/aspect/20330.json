{"The claim is supported by specific quotes and statements made by Thom Tillis himself": "as mentioned in the ad. These quotes indicate his support for a plan that would end Medicare as we know it and impose additional costs on seniors.", "The ad references articles from reputable sources like the Raleigh News": "Observer and Reuters, which discuss Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan in 2011. These articles provide evidence of how Ryan's plan would have made significant changes to the structure of Medicare.", "The expert mentions that the ad": "s characterization of Ryan's plan is more measured than previous versions used by Democrats in 2011. This suggests that the claim is based on a more accurate understanding of the proposed changes to Medicare.", "The expert notes that the ad is produced by Patriot Majority USA": "a pro-Democratic group operating independently of the Hagan campaign. This indicates that the claim is not directly influenced by Hagan's campaign and adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim."}
