{"Rubio": "s statement: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida defended a 2013 vote not to authorize President Barack Obama to use military force in Syria by saying the strategy wasn\u2019t worth risking American lives. He specifically referenced Obama's statement about conducting a \"pinprick\" attack.", "Obama": "s denial: During an interview on the Today show, Obama stated that \"the U.S. does not do pinpricks\" and emphasized the impact of even limited strikes on a country like Syria. He denied referring to potential strikes against Assad as a \"pinprick\" attack.", "Expert opinion": "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, stated that while \"pinprick\" is not a technical description of a military strike, it is often used in a pejorative manner. This expert opinion supports the notion that the term was employed by Rubio to question the effectiveness of Obama's proposed strategy."}
