{"Bishop": "s claim that he was the \"deciding vote\" is exaggerated, as the GOP-authored bill wouldn't have advanced without the help of a Democrat.", "To override a veto": "the state House and state Senate each need three-fifths of their present members to support the idea. The Senate's override vote was 30 in favor and 20 opposed, meaning the effort advanced by one vote.", "Gerry Cohen": "former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly, described Bishop's claim as a \"non sequitur\" and stated that it's misleading for him to say he cast the \"deciding\" vote."}
