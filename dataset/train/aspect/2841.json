{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was based on a news release from the governor's office, which cited the Reason Foundation's 24th annual highway report as the source of the rankings.", "The methodology of the ranking": "The expert's verdict explains that the Reason Foundation's annual highway report ranks states based on 13 categories, such as highway expenditures per mile, pavement conditions, congestion, bridge conditions, and fatality rates. This methodology was employed to determine West Virginia's ranking.", "Comparison to other states": "The expert's verdict highlights that West Virginia's ranking of 16th in the country was compared to other states. It mentions that West Virginia was slightly ahead of Ohio and Maryland but behind Virginia in overall ranking. Additionally, it mentions that West Virginia performed better than some states like Indiana but worse than others like Kentucky.", "Limitations of the report": "The expert's verdict points out that the report used data primarily from 2016, which was before the current governor took office. It also mentions that only two categories out of the 13 used 2017 data. This limitation suggests that the report may not fully reflect the impact of the current governor's policies on the state's highways."}
