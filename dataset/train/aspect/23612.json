{"The claim was based on an article published by multimedia news agency ANI": "which quoted an unnamed member of PM House staff stating that Pakistan's first lady's image does not appear in mirrors.", "ANI later deleted the article and published another one titled": "Twitterati divided over reports that Pakistan PM Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi's image doesn't form in mirrors,\" indicating a lack of consistency in their reporting.", "Capital TV": "the channel that was supposedly the source of the news, denied ever publishing such a report and accused ANI of using a \"photoshopped poster\" with their logo, highlighting potential manipulation of information.", "Alt News": "while searching for older reports, found a tweet by a journalist from Capital TV stating that no such news was aired by the channel and that they had filed a complaint with the FIA Cyber Crime Wing in the past regarding a fake poster. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
