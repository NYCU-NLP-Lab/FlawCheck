{"Former Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich claimed that the default rate for college students has grown from 40 percent 10 years ago to about 50 percent today": "2. Kucinich's claim is based on a report by Columbia professor Judith Scott-Clayton for the Brookings Institution, which projected that about 40 percent of students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023.", "However": "Sandy Baum, who wrote a report for the College Board, provided data showing that the two-year cohort default rate was nowhere near 40 percent in the past couple of decades, with the highest point being 22.4 percent in 1990.", "The U": "S. Education Department released data in 2017 showing that the national default rate for the 2014 cohort was 11 percent, contradicting Kucinich's claim of a 50 percent default rate today."}
