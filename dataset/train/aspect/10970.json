{"The claim made by Beto O": "Rourke is based on the Texas Legislature's House Bill 3859, signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, which allows social service groups to decline services to individuals if their beliefs conflict with the group's religious beliefs.", "The law does not explicitly bar services to anyone based on sexual orientation": "including adoption. However, critics argue that it can be interpreted as allowing discrimination against gay Texans seeking to adopt.", "Supporters of the legislation and a state agency argue that the law does not prevent any qualified adults": "including gay residents, from adopting. They claim that the law only requires social service groups to direct individuals to another service provider or a state list of providers if they choose to decline services.", "Opponents of the law": "such as Equality Texas and the Human Rights Campaign, maintain that it enables discrimination based on sexual orientation or other factors, potentially limiting adoption opportunities for gay couples or individuals."}
