{"The source of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from a 2015 article published by the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC), a pro-gun rights nonprofit run by economist John Lott. This establishes the source of the claim and its credibility.", "Definition of a mass shooting": "The expert highlights the difficulty in defining a mass shooting, as different organizations and institutions have varying criteria. The FBI, Everytown for Gun Safety, Mother Jones, and the Mass Shootings in America project all have different definitions, which can impact the accuracy and interpretation of the claim.", "Statistical methods used": "The expert points out that the statistical methods employed by the CPRC to compare mass shooting death rates between the United States and European countries are inappropriate and misleading. The claim fails to consider the rarity of mass shootings in most countries, resulting in an outsized statistical effect when they do occur.", "Inclusion of specific types of incidents": "The expert mentions that the metrics used to count mass shootings often focus on incidents that occur in public places and exclude domestic family annihilations. Additionally, terrorism-related shootings are often included, which can significantly impact the comparison of mass shootings between the United States and other countries."}
