{"Priorities USA Action provided examples of state contracts that included the use of call centers in India while Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts": "This suggests that India gained jobs thanks to Romney's involvement in these contracts.", "Romney chose not to end the arrangement with Citigroup": "a state contractor that outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India. Although it was not the state directly outsourcing the work, Romney's decision to continue the arrangement implies that India gained jobs as a result.", "Bain Capital": "the firm Romney was associated with, invested in a software company called CSI, which later merged with another firm to form Stream International. Stream International announced the establishment of call centers in India after Romney had left Bain. While Romney's influence was indirect, it can be inferred that India gained jobs through this investment.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that Romney and Bain joined the bandwagon of outsourcing, rather than being pioneers in the practice. This suggests that India gained jobs as a result of outsourcing practices adopted by Romney and Bain, even though they were not the first to engage in such practices."}
