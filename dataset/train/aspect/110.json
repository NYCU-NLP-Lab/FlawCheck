{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that the article did not provide any actual quotes or citations from the supposed government anesthesiologist, Henry Rothschild. This lack of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Dubious news site": "The claim originated from a dubious news site, which suggests a lack of reliability and credibility. The expert's verdict points out that this site has previously reported unsubstantiated claims, further undermining the trustworthiness of the claim.", "Inconsistent and sensational language": "The language used in the claim, such as \"terminar\" being translated as \"terminate,\" and the mention of a furtive plot to harm Black women, raises concerns about sensationalism and lack of factual basis. The expert's verdict highlights the bombastic nature of the claim, which further questions its authenticity.", "Contradictory evidence": "The expert's verdict presents evidence from studies and organizations that contradict the claim. The CDC's lack of published statistics for the mentioned years and the APHA study showing higher occurrences of birth defects among other ethnic groups undermine the claim's credibility. This contradictory evidence suggests that the claim may not be accurate."}
