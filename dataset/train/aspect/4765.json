{"The photographs were not taken in 2018": "The expert's verdict states that none of the photographs used to support the claim were taken in 2018, which undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "The photographs do not depict members of the migrant caravan": "The expert's verdict clarifies that none of the images actually feature individuals who were part of the migrant caravan. This suggests that the claim is false and misleading.", "The first photograph does not show an American flag being burned": "The expert's verdict explains that the top photograph, often shared as evidence of flag burning, actually depicts a man burning a Trump banner, not an American flag. This detail further discredits the claim.", "The second photograph was taken in a different context": "The expert's verdict reveals that the second image, showing a burning flag on the ground, was taken in 2010 outside the American Embassy in London during a protest against threats to burn the Qur'an. This indicates that the photograph is unrelated to the migrant caravan or the claim being made."}
