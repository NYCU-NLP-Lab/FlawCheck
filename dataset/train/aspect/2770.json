{"Comparison of export value": "The expert examined the claim by comparing the value of exports from the United States to that of other developed countries. They found that in absolute terms, the United States exports a massive amount of goods and services, ranking behind only Germany and China.", "Measurement of trade as a percentage of GDP": "The expert also considered the value of exports in relation to each country's overall economy. By measuring the value of exports as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the United States was found to have a lower ratio compared to other countries. The World Bank data showed that the United States' exports represented 13% of its GDP in 2008, which was lower than several other nations.", "Comparison to other countries with similar export ratios": "To further support the claim, the expert compared the United States' export ratio to that of other countries with similar percentages. The data showed that the United States' export ratio was comparable to countries like Haiti, Nepal, Tonga, and Ethiopia, indicating a relatively lower level of trade compared to other developed nations.", "Analogy with crime rates": "The expert used an analogy with crime rates to explain the distortion that can occur when comparing trade numbers. They compared the situation to a big city having more crimes in absolute numbers but a smaller city having a higher crime rate when considering the number of crimes relative to its population. Similarly, the United States, being a large country, may have higher absolute trade numbers, but its export ratio as a percentage of GDP is relatively lower compared to other developed nations."}
