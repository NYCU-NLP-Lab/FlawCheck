{"Lack of evidence to support the claim": "The expert's verdict states that the website Elect Leaders provided no evidence to back up their claim that Disney had removed Piglet products to appease the Muslim community. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Availability of Piglet products": "A quick search on Disneystore.com revealed that various Piglet merchandise, such as plush toys, books, pencils, cups, shirts, bags, stickers, plates, baby bibs, and iPhone covers, are still available for sale. This contradicts the claim that Disney has removed all Piglet items from their stores.", "Absence of official announcements": "Disney has not made any official announcements regarding Piglet's supposed absence from their stores or any decision to appease Muslim complaints. The lack of official statements raises questions about the validity of the claim.", "Plagiarized and sensationalized story": "The 2015 story published by Elect Leaders is an exaggerated and false version of a news article originally published by The Guardian in 2000. Elect Leaders plagiarized The Guardian's article and sensationalized it by changing phrases and altering the location of the story. This manipulation of the original story casts doubt on the credibility of the claim."}
