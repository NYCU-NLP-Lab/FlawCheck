{"The World Bank": "s list of exports of COVID-19 testing equipment was examined and found to be based on an older list of existing diagnostic testing equipment. This suggests that the claim of COVID-19 tests being exported in 2018 is not accurate.", "The equipment used for COVID": "19 testing was found to have existed prior to 2019, but COVID-19 tests themselves did not exist in 2018. This provides further evidence that the claim is not authentic.", "The Facebook post that cited the list of medical exports as evidence of COVID": "19 tests in 2018 was debunked by multiple fact-checkers. This indicates that the claim is not supported by reliable sources.", "The World Integrated Trade Solution": "WITS) portal, maintained by the World Bank in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, was analyzed. The table shown in the Facebook post was found to list exporters of instruments used in clinical laboratories for in vitro diagnosis and carbon dioxide detectors, which were not specifically designed for COVID-19 testing. This reinforces the conclusion that the claim is not valid."}
