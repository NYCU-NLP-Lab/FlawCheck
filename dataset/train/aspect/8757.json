{"Lack of substantive information": "The expert notes that despite the widespread sharing of the photograph, no one provided any substantial information about the alleged enormous rodent, raising doubts about its authenticity.", "Discrepancy in size and species": "The expert explains that if the rat in the picture was truly caught in New York City, it would most likely be a brown rat, which typically grows to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs. in weight. However, the pictured rat appears much larger, weighing 41 lbs. This inconsistency in size and species raises questions about the claim's authenticity.", "Appearance and grooming": "Commenters pointed out that the photographed rat appears groomed and cleaned, suggesting that it may be someone's pet rather than a wild rat. The expert suggests that if the rat is indeed a pet, it is likely a Gambian Pouch Rat, which can be larger than a brown rat but typically doesn't exceed four pounds. This observation further casts doubt on the claim.", "Forced perspective": "The expert speculates that the rat in the photograph may appear massive due to forced perspective. The person holding the rat is likely using a pole to position the animal closer to the camera, creating an illusion of a much larger rat. This explanation provides a plausible reason for the exaggerated size depicted in the picture."}
