{"The claim is based on a Facebook post by vegan YouTuber Sonia Sae": "who suggests that cow's milk contains blood and pus, and promotes plant-based milk as a healthier and more ethical alternative.", "The photo used in the Facebook post is a screenshot from a video posted by a dairy farmer in Gloucestershire": "England, in 2013. The video shows the milking process and explains that cows produce colostrum after giving birth, which is a thick and creamy liquid that cannot be sold as milk.", "Health regulations in Canada": "Mexico, and the United States prohibit the commercialization of milk containing colostrum, and it is primarily used as a dietary supplement for newborn calves. The farmer in the video stores colostrum for this purpose.", "The pink liquid shown in the screenshot from the video is a result of a cow with mastitis or other illnesses": "When a cow with mastitis is milked, blood may mix with the milk, giving it a pink color. However, this milk cannot be sold, as dairy industry regulations mandate its disposal."}
