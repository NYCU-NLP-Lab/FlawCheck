{"Lack of evidence from George Washington": "The expert, Edward Lengel, states that there is no evidence that George Washington ever wrote or said the quote in question or anything similar to it. This lack of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical context and interpretation": "The expert explains that the closest statement found from George Washington relates to the importance of a trained militia for national defense, rather than individuals arming themselves to counter perceived governmental tyranny. This suggests that the claim may be misinterpreting or misrepresenting Washington's views.", "Previous similar claims": "The expert mentions that this is not the first time a similar claim has been made, indicating a pattern of inaccurate attributions to George Washington. This suggests that caution should be exercised when encountering such claims.", "Lack of response from Rep": "Louie Gohmert's office: When seeking details on a different Washington quotation related to gun rights, PolitiFact Texas did not receive a response from Gohmert's office. This lack of response raises questions about the credibility and accuracy of the claim."}
