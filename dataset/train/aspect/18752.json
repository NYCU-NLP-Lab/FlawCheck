{"Consultation with Shea": "Porter's staff: The fact-checkers contacted Shea-Porter's staff to gather information and clarification about the claim. They confirmed that according to their understanding, New Hampshire is the only state without a full-service VA or Tricare hospital.", "Statements by other politicians": "The fact-checkers mentioned that other politicians, including U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte, have made similar claims in support of legislation aimed at improving veterans' healthcare in New Hampshire. This indicates a level of consensus among politicians regarding the lack of a full-service veterans hospital in the state.", "Historical context": "The fact-checkers provided information about the downsizing of New Hampshire's VA Medical Center in Manchester over a decade ago due to financial reasons. They mentioned that since then, multiple bills similar to Shea-Porter's have been introduced by members of New Hampshire's congressional delegation, further supporting the claim.", "Comparison with other states": "The fact-checkers mentioned that Shea-Porter's chief of staff stated that Alaska and Hawaii have Tricare military hospitals, which veterans can access. This implies that these states have some level of equivalent access to healthcare services for veterans, unlike New Hampshire."}
