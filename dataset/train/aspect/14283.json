{"Testimony from Jeremiah Samples": "The expert's verdict mentions that Jeremiah Samples, the deputy secretary of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, testified before the state Senate about the increase in the number of children taken into state custody. This testimony serves as a primary source of information to verify the claim.", "Data from the federal Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System": "The expert's verdict states that a spokeswoman for Samples' department provided data from 2013 to 2018, showing the number of children in foster care on September 30 of each year. This data, collected by the federal system, confirms the increase of 67 percent in the number of children in state custody since 2013.", "Comparison with national statistics": "The expert's verdict mentions that the percentage increase for the nation as a whole between 2013 and 2017 was 11 percent. By comparing this national average with West Virginia's increase of 67 percent, it becomes evident that the state's increase is substantially larger than the United States as a whole.", "Additional relevant statistics": "The expert's verdict highlights that while the one-day snapshot of children in the foster care system showed a 67 percent increase, there are other relevant statistics to consider. The number of children entering the foster care system rose by 42 percent between 2013 and 2016, and the number of children waiting for adoption rose by 76 percent. These additional statistics further support the authenticity of the claim."}
