{"The incorrect address": "The expert's verdict states that the claim about the Red Hen restaurant being located at 666 E. Washington is inaccurate. The restaurant's real address is 11 E. Washington.", "Fake Yelp page": "The rumor seems to have started with a fake Yelp page that was created after the news about Sarah Huckabee Sanders' experience at the Red Hen broke.

It is unclear how exactly this information was changed, but it was likely done by the same people who hacked the Red Hen's menu page.", "Photographs of the restaurant": "The expert's verdict mentions that photographs of the restaurant's door clearly show the number \"11,\" debunking the claim that the address contains \"the Number of the Beast.\""}
