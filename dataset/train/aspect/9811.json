{"The expert": "s personal experience and observations: The expert, Dr. David Wartinger, mentions that he had patients who claimed to have passed kidney stones after riding the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster at Walt Disney World. This personal experience and observation prompted him to investigate further.", "Published study in a peer": "reviewed journal: Dr. Wartinger conducted experiments using a lifelike silicone model of the human urinary tract and published his findings in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. The study confirmed that roller coaster rides may facilitate the passage of kidney stones.", "Use of a validated synthetic 3D model": "Dr. Wartinger used a synthetic 3D model of a hollow kidney with three kidney stones inserted. This model allowed him to simulate the conditions of the urinary tract and test the theory of roller coaster facilitation of kidney stone passage.", "Replication of patient experiences": "Dr. Wartinger replicated the experiences of his patients by taking the synthetic kidney model on the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster multiple times. This allowed him to test the theory and verify the claim that the roller coaster ride can help dislodge kidney stones."}
