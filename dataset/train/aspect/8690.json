{"The claim is made by a group called": "Stronger New Mexico,\" which is backed by the Democratic Governors Association. This suggests a potential bias in the claim.", "The claim states that Rep": "Steve Pearce was \"twice named one of the most corrupt members of Congress by an independent watchdog group.\" The group in question is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which has a Democratic tilt and has been criticized for its methodology.", "The basis for the claim of corruption against Pearce is primarily centered around a transaction he made in 2003": "where he sold the assets of his oilfield equipment leasing business for a reported $12 million. However, the House Ethics Committee ruled that Pearce was not legally required to report this transaction.", "Despite admitting their error in not discovering the ethics panel": "s ruling clearing Pearce, CREW did not retract their \"corrupt\" label and maintained that they stood by their original interpretation of the law requiring disclosure. This raises questions about the credibility and objectivity of the watchdog group."}
