{"Comparison of job growth": "The expert compared the job growth during the current recovery period under Obama's tenure with the job growth during the previous recovery period under Bush's presidency. This involved analyzing Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers for the first 49 months after the end of both recessions.", "Calculation of job numbers": "The expert calculated the actual number of private-sector jobs created during the two recovery periods. They found that under Obama's recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, while during the equivalent period under Bush's recovery, it increased by 3.17 million.", "Evaluation of Obama": "s claim: The expert assessed whether Obama's claim of creating \"nearly twice as many jobs\" in the current recovery compared to the previous one was accurate. They concluded that Obama's statement was correct based on the calculated job numbers.", "Alternative analysis": "The expert also explored an alternative method of measuring job growth by starting from the low point in private-sector employment instead of the official end of the recovery. This analysis showed that the job growth during the Bush recovery was slightly higher than during Obama's recovery, but still supported Obama's claim of significant job creation."}
