{"Lack of hydrologic data": "The expert points out that the claim of the Mississippi River \"going dry\" is unsupported by any hydrologic data. There is no evidence of an anomalous loss of water that would be expected in such a scenario.", "Comparison of water levels": "The expert suggests comparing current water levels near the Mississippi River and close to the New Madrid fault with historical data. By doing so, it can be determined if the current levels are lower than usual. The example of a well in Caruthersville, Missouri, located over the fault, shows normal or even higher-than-average levels.", "Presence of drought": "The expert contradicts the claim that there has been no drought in the area that could explain differing water levels. They state that the Bootheel, Southeast Ozarks, and the area covering the New Madrid fault have experienced abnormally dry conditions, and farmers have been pumping water for irrigation.", "Analysis of river flow": "Another approach taken by the expert is to analyze the river's flow both upstream and downstream of the alleged fault line. This analysis can provide insights into whether there are any significant changes in the river's behavior that could support the claim. Unfortunately, the provided information does not reveal the specific findings of this analysis."}
