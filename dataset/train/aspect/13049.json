{"The viral video": "The expert's verdict mentions a now-viral video posted on Facebook by Wendy Wilkerson Underwood. This video shows a pile of discarded food, bags, and crates, which the narrator claims were donated items thrown away by the Red Cross. The video serves as evidence to support the claim.", "Red Cross spokesperson denial": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Red Cross spokesperson Elizabeth Penniman, who denies that any directive was given to discard or dispose of donated items. This denial by an official representative of the organization adds credibility to the Red Cross's position.", "Unanswered inquiries": "The expert's verdict mentions that numerous inquiries made to Wendy Wilkerson Underwood, the person who originally posted the video, have gone unanswered. This lack of response raises questions about the authenticity and credibility of the claims made in the video.", "Location discrepancy": "The expert's verdict highlights a significant distance between the location where the video was filmed (Waco, Texas) and the Red Cross's primary warehousing operations in Houston. The expert mentions that the Red Cross has asked Underwood to provide evidence of her presence at any Red Cross shelters or warehousing facilities, as well as to identify the \"Red Cross Director\" she cites in the video. Underwood's failure to provide this information casts doubt on the veracity of her claims."}
