{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no evidence provided to support the claim that Barack Obama will force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies. The links provided by the supporters of the claim do not address the involvement of doctors, surrogacy, or the act of buying babies.", "Contradictory actions": "The expert mentions that Obama's support for adoption by same-sex couples and extended benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees does not prove the claim. These actions are not related to forcing doctors to assist in buying surrogate babies, and there is no evidence to suggest that Obama would be interested in such an action.", "Lack of related actions or statements": "The expert notes that there is no remotely related action or statement by Obama or his administration that would lead to the conclusion of the claim. The Human Rights Campaign, a group that lobbies for equal treatment of gays and lesbians, also hasn't seen any evidence supporting the claim.", "Legal limitations": "The expert mentions that even if Obama were interested in such an action, it would be nearly impossible due to legal limitations. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state, and it is a matter of state law, not federal law. In some states, surrogacy is illegal or heavily regulated, making it difficult for Obama or any administration to enforce such a requirement."}
