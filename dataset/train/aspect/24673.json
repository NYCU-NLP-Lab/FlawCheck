{"Eyewitness account": "The expert spoke to an eyewitness who confirmed that protesters in Portland were indeed burning American flags and Bibles during anti-racism protests in the summer of 2020.", "Verification through videos and photos": "The expert analyzed viral videos and photos shared by a reporter, Danny Peterson, which showed protesters burning items that resembled Bibles and American flags. Although it was not clear which specific protest group was responsible, Peterson confirmed that he had seen a truck handing out free Bibles earlier in the day and verified with protesters that the book he saw burning was a Bible.", "Location and context": "The videos were captured outside the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Federal Courthouse, which had been the center of clashes between federal agents and Black Lives Matter protesters. This context supports the claim that the burning of flags and Bibles occurred during the anti-racism protests.", "Lack of self": "identification: While conservative publications and social media users attributed the burning to \"anarchists,\" the \"radical left,\" or Black Lives Matter protesters, there was no confirmation from officials regarding the specific group responsible. The expert noted that the groups burning Bibles and American flags did not self-identify with any particular group, indicating a diverse range of participants in the protests."}
