{"The claim is supported by a quote from Gov": "Rick Perry's book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, where he states that the federal debt is \"too overwhelming to comprehend.\"", "The claim is further supported by a citation of a Bloomberg news article that predicts a budget deficit of": "1.5 trillion, higher than previous forecasts, due to a deeper and longer recession than expected.", "The claim is backed up by historical data": "mentioning that most years the U.S. spends more than it takes in, resulting in a budget deficit that needs to be covered by borrowing. It highlights that the last year the U.S. had a surplus was in 2001.", "The claim is reinforced by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office": "CBO), which projected a federal deficit of $1.5 trillion in fiscal year 2010 and $1.3 trillion in 2011 if President Obama's budget proposals were enacted. Dividing these figures by the number of days in a year provides an estimate of the debt growing by more than $4 billion a day in 2010 and around $3.6 billion a day in 2011."}
