{"The claim states that": "one thousand people a day are moving to Texas.\" The expert's verdict confirms that there has been a significant influx of people to Texas, but also notes that people routinely leave the state. The expert provides data from the U.S. Census Bureau estimates, indicating that net migration over a 12-month period was 177,715, resulting in an average of 487 net migrants to Texas each day.", "The expert": "s verdict mentions that the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, confirmed that more than 1,000 people a day may have moved to Texas from other states and countries from July 2012 through June 2013. However, the expert notes that the figure provided by Potter is slightly lower than what the claim states.", "The expert also includes information from Robert Bernstein": "a bureau spokesman, who cited the bureau's Texas estimates to state that the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over a 12-month period. This figure takes into account net migration as well as births outnumbering deaths.", "The expert further provides insights from Steve Murdock": "a Rice University sociologist and former state demographer, who states that Texas added nearly 1,100 people a day from April 2010 through June 2013. This increase was primarily due to births outnumbering deaths, but net migration from abroad and other states also contributed to the population growth."}
