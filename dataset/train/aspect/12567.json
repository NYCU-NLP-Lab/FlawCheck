{"The timing of the statement": "The expert's verdict highlights that the referenced Meet the Press interview with Donald Trump took place in October 2015, nine months before the claim was made. This demonstrates that the claim is not recent and therefore lacks authenticity.", "Context of the statement": "The expert's verdict explains that Trump's response during the interview was in reference to the long race for the Republican nomination, not the general election against Hillary Clinton. This clarifies that the claim misinterprets the context of Trump's statement, further questioning its authenticity.", "Lack of recent confirmation": "The expert's verdict mentions that in Trump's most recent Meet the Press appearance in July 2016, after he was officially nominated as the Republican candidate, he did not express any intention of dropping out of the race. This absence of recent confirmation contradicts the claim and casts doubt on its authenticity.", "Misleading image": "The expert's verdict addresses a misleading image that circulated on Facebook, falsely implying that Trump had recently proclaimed on Meet the Press that he would drop out of the race if polls showed him losing to Clinton. This image further supports the lack of authenticity of the claim."}
