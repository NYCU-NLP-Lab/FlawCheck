{"The claim contradicts previous reports and statements": "The expert points out that the claim of Malia Obama being fired from an internship at the Spanish embassy contradicts previous reports which stated that she interned at the embassy in 2016 and there were no reports of her dismissal. This inconsistency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of credible sources and unreliable website": "The expert highlights that the claim originated from an unreliable website called FreedomCrossroads.us. The website is known for publishing fake news, which reduces the credibility of the claim.", "Unrealistic details and factual errors": "The expert points out several unrealistic details and factual errors in the claim. For example, the claim mentions Malia Obama being caught by U.S. Marines on the roof of the embassy building, which is deemed unrealistic as the primary role of Marines stationed at embassies is to protect classified material, not monitor interns. Additionally, the claim refers to an ambassador named Bedard, who doesn't exist, and there is currently no U.S. ambassador in Spain. These factual errors further undermine the authenticity of the claim.", "Repetition of previous fake news stories": "The expert mentions that this is not the first time fake news stories about Malia Obama have circulated. Previous reports debunked by the expert included claims of Malia being expelled from Harvard and being arrested for various offenses. The repetition of such fake news stories raises suspicions about the credibility of the claim in question."}
