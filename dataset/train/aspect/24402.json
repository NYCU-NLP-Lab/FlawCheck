{"The presence of doctored images": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was accompanied by a doctored image of Barack Obama as a young Black Panther. This aspect indicates that the authenticity of the claim was questioned due to the alteration of the original photograph.", "Comparison with the original photograph": "The expert's verdict includes the original, unaltered photograph that was first published online in 2009. The comparison between the doctored image and the original photograph helped in verifying the claim's authenticity.", "Deletion of the doctored image": "The expert's verdict states that the doctored image was shared on a website in 2014 but was later deleted, presumably after someone pointed out that it was not an authentic depiction of President Obama. This aspect suggests that the claim was debunked and further supports the authenticity of the original photograph.", "Unclear source of the unaltered photograph": "The expert's verdict mentions that the precise source of the unaltered photograph is unclear. This aspect indicates that the original photograph was found on websites that used it as a general illustration of content relating to Black Panthers, rather than being associated with a specific event. However, a visible date stamp on the photograph suggested it was taken in 1998, adding to its credibility."}
