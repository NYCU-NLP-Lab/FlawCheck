{"Comparison of location": "The expert conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the video and identified a signboard that indicated the location as \"Royal Sarees/M C Sarees.\" Through a Google search, it was found that M C Sarees is a shop located in Madanpura, Varanasi, not Udupi, Karnataka.", "Comparison of events": "The expert compared the events in the video with another video from Varanasi, where PM Modi is seen being handed a bouquet of flowers and then wearing a hat thrown at him.
