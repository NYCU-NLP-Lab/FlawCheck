{"The state Department of Environmental Protection": "in collaboration with local health departments, conducts weekly tests of water samples from Sandy Hook to Cape May from mid-May to mid-September. These tests measure the levels of fecal coliform and other bacteria associated with sewage, stormwater runoff, and other pollutants.", "The test results consistently show that the water quality along the Jersey shore has been clean since at least 2006": "ranking above the 99th percentile of cleanliness on a scale of 100 percent. New Jersey was even ranked second in the nation for ocean water quality in 2010.", "The tests specifically monitor the levels of enterococcus": "a bacteria commonly found in feces. Any level above 104 enterococci per 100 milliliters of sample is considered too high according to state standards. However, the levels of enterococci have consistently remained well below the state's threshold, indicating good water quality.", "In cases where test samples exceed acceptable bacteria levels twice": "the beach is closed until the bacteria levels return to normal range. This summer, three beaches were closed along the shore due to high bacteria levels, which challenges Governor Christie's claim of \"perfect\" water quality."}
