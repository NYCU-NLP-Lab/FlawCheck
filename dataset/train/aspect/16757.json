{"The claim is based on an infographic titled": "The Gentleman's Guide to Amputation,\" which has been widely shared on social media platforms since 2011.", "The infographic was created by an artist known as": "Onorobo\" and was originally posted on Tumblr on October 11, 2011. Onorobo described it as an \"info-graphic I drew for class.\"", "While the infographic accurately reflects 19th": "century surgical practices, it is not a historical document but a piece of art.", "To further support the claim": "s inauthenticity, evidence is provided in the form of a 1830s infographic by French medical illustrator Nicolas Henri Jacob and a 1902 cartoon titled \"We can rest a little,\" both depicting amputation procedures. These historical references suggest that dark humor and the use of alcohol during the process were not uncommon, but they do not validate the claim's authenticity."}
