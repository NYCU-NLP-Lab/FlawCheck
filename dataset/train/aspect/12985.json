{"The claim is attributed to Sen": "Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who made the statement at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Jan. 30, 2019. This attribution helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The claim aligns with Sanders": "previous statements and support for a $15 minimum wage. The expert mentions that supporting a $15 minimum wage has become a litmus test for Democratic candidates, and Sanders has been a vocal advocate for this increase.", "The claim references a study released by the Economic Policy Institute": "EPI), a left-of-center think tank. The expert mentions that Sanders was close in describing the study, which specifically analyzed the potential impact of the Raise the Wage Act of 2019, sponsored by Sanders and other Democrats.", "The study itself supports the claim": "stating that 39.7 million Americans will benefit from the $15 minimum wage once it is reached by 2024. While the exact number differs slightly from Sanders' statement of \"more than 40 million,\" it still confirms a significant impact on low-wage workers."}
