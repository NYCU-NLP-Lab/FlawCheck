{"The expert referred to a report from the Small Business Administration": "s Office of Advocacy, which stated that 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs come from small businesses. This report provided evidence to support the claim.", "The expert mentioned that Brian Headd": "an economist with the SBA, confirmed that Cantor's statement about small businesses creating 70 percent of jobs is accurate. Headd stated that the numbers may vary depending on the year, but Cantor's statement is a reasonable generalization.", "The expert cited data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "which showed that in the first quarter of 2011, 85 percent of the 300,000 net new jobs created were from businesses with less than 500 employees. This data further supported the claim.", "The expert acknowledged that the SBA findings only focused on net new jobs created in the private sector and did not consider jobs created by government entities": "This limitation was mentioned to provide a complete understanding of the claim's authenticity."}
