{"Lack of verifiable data": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of concrete evidence or data to support the claim made by Boss Mustapha regarding the N-Power program's success in creating over 2 million employment opportunities. The available numbers on the program's website and statements from officials do not align with Mustapha's figures.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert's verdict points out the contradictory statements made by different government officials regarding the success of the N-Power program. While Mustapha claims significant job creation and poverty reduction, other officials and experts argue that these claims cannot be proven.", "Unanswered requests for the source of figures": "The expert's verdict mentions that both the presidency and the agency overseeing the N-Power program have not responded to requests for the source of the employment figures provided by Mustapha. This lack of transparency raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconclusive assessment of job creation record": "The expert's verdict states that the jury is still out on President Buhari's first term job-creation record. This implies that there is no definitive evidence or consensus on the effectiveness of the government's job creation efforts, including the N-Power program."}
