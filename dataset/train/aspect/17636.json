This information provides evidence that Russia's economy is larger than Khanna's district.", "The expert refers to the calculation made by the Brookings Institution": "s Metropolitan Policy Program, which estimated the GDP of Khanna's congressional district at $103.9 billion. This figure further supports that the district's GDP is significantly smaller than Russia's.", "The expert explains the difference between market capitalization and GDP": "emphasizing that they are not directly comparable.
