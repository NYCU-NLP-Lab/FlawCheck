{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no specific evidence or record of a black woman named Malinda Borden working aboard the Titanic or being denied a spot in a lifeboat due to her race. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradiction with historical facts": "The expert points out that the claim contradicts what is known about the racial discrimination laws and demographics of the Titanic. The post suggests that black workers were present on the ship and denied access to lifeboats, but historical records indicate that black individuals were largely absent from the Titanic, both as passengers and crew members.", "Verification of the photograph": "Although the expert couldn't determine the specific origins of the photograph, they state that the Facebook post does not relay an authentic story about the Titanic tragedy. This suggests that the photograph itself may not be reliable evidence supporting the claim.", "Alternative historical account": "The expert provides an alternative account of a black family, the Laroche family, who were aboard the Titanic. However, this account does not align with the claim of a black woman named Malinda Borden being denied a spot in a lifeboat. The presence of this alternative historical account further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
