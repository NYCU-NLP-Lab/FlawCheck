{"The claim falsely states that former President Barack Obama separated more children at the border than President Donald Trump": "2. The Trump administration implemented a new rule on August 21, 2019, allowing for longer detention of immigrant families crossing the border illegally.", "The new rule aims to keep families detained together to avoid the issue of children being separated from their parents": "which occurred under the Trump administration's previous policy.", "The U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general's report confirms that family separations were rare under previous administrations but increased significantly due to the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy. The report identified 2,737 children who were separated from their parents at that time, with potentially thousands more separated during the influx that began in 2017."}
