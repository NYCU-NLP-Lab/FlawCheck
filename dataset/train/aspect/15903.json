{"Verification through campaign backup": "The expert mentions that they asked Chris Abele's campaign for evidence to support the claim. The campaign spokesperson directed them to Sue Black, who was said to have informed Abele about the pay raise issue. However, since Black did not respond to their calls, the expert had to rely on other sources of information, such as county records and past news reports, to verify the claim.", "Employment history and reputation": "The expert provides information about Sue Black's employment history, stating that she was hired by Scott Walker in 2004 to run the county parks and previously served as the director of the Wisconsin State Park System. It is mentioned that she earned a national award in 2009 for her performance in managing the parks system despite budget cuts. This aspect helps establish Black's credibility and expertise in her role as the parks director.", "Salary information": "The expert mentions that Sue Black was paid $117,973 for a considerable period of time. This information helps verify the claim that she did not receive a pay raise in five years, as it indicates a lack of increase in her salary during that period.", "Unusual pay raises for department heads": "The expert mentions that after Scott Walker's re-election in 2008, he rewarded several county department heads with higher pay by moving up their pay grades when they were reappointed to their jobs. This information suggests that pay raises were given to some department heads during that time, raising questions about why Sue Black did not receive a similar increase in salary."}
