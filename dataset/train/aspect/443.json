{"The claim is based on a television ad launched by Republican Gov": "Scott Walker that accuses Democratic challenger Tony Evers of wanting to give in-state tuition and driver's licenses to \"illegal aliens.\"", "The ad includes clips from a debate sponsored by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association": "where Evers is shown stating his support for legislation that would allow DACA students to have in-state tuition and driver's licenses for undocumented individuals.", "The term": "illegal alien\" used in the claim is a preferred verbiage by many on the right for undocumented immigrants, but it is not officially defined in federal law.", "The tuition question specifically refers to DACA students": "who are individuals brought to the country illegally as children and are protected by the Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals program. Evers expressed support for allowing these students to have in-state tuition."}
