{"The expert examined the specific statements made by Wisconsin state Sen": "Lena Taylor, both in a video and on Twitter, where she compared Gov. Scott Walker to Hitler and claimed that he was \"abolishing unions\" like Hitler did in 1933.", "The expert analyzed the content of Walker": "s budget-repair bill, which included changes to collective bargaining rights for public employees. They found that while the bill did curtail collective bargaining rights, it did not \"abolish\" unions as Taylor claimed. The bill still allowed public employee unions to negotiate wages and exempted certain unions, such as those representing public safety workers.", "The expert considered Taylor": "s argument that Walker's legislative goals and support for right-to-work legislation indicated a broader intention of \"union busting\" in the coming years. They examined the evidence provided by Taylor, including the limits on bargaining rights in the bill and Walker's past support for right-to-work legislation.", "The expert also took into account the historical context and the actions of Hitler in 1933": "They assessed whether there were significant similarities between Hitler's actions to abolish unions and Walker's proposed changes to collective bargaining rights. The expert concluded that while there were some parallels in terms of limiting union power, the claim of Walker \"doing today\" what Hitler did in 1933 was exaggerated and not supported by the evidence."}
