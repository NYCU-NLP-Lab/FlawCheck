{"Lack of official record": "The expert points out that there is no official record of Michelle Obama's arrest, indicating that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Contradictory reports": "The expert highlights the conflicting reports from different sources. While the Patriot Post claims Michelle Obama was arrested, the reaganwasright.com website contradicts this by stating that there was no actual arrest and the incident was merely a family squabble.", "Source credibility": "The expert identifies the Patriot Post and reaganwasright.com as fake news sites known for spreading political clickbait and falsely labeling themselves as satire. This suggests that the sources of the claim lack credibility and reliability.", "Satirical nature": "The expert emphasizes that both the Patriot Post and reaganwasright.com explicitly state that their content is purely fictional and satirical. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim and reinforces the notion that it is not based on real events."}
