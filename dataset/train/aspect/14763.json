{"Testimony from Rep": "Chris Collins: The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Chris Collins claimed that farmers in New York state are dumping milk into ditches because of the trade dispute with Canada. This is the primary aspect that needs to be verified for authenticity.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that a spokesman for Collins' office could not provide any specific examples of farms that have dumped milk due to the trade dispute. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Role of cooperatives": "The expert's verdict mentions that there are two major processing facilities in New York state that export ultra-filtered milk to Canada. These facilities are supplied by cooperatives that handle the marketing and distribution of milk from multiple farms. It is mentioned that if milk needs to be dumped, the loss is spread across all members of the cooperative instead of individual farmers. This aspect suggests that if milk dumping were occurring, it may not be limited to specific farms but rather shared among multiple members of the cooperatives.", "Confirmation from O": "AT-KA: The expert's verdict includes a statement from Craig S. Alexander, vice president for dairy ingredients and regulatory affairs at O-AT-KA, one of the major processing facilities. Alexander states that no milk from Upstate Niagara Cooperative has been dumped due to the trade dispute with Canada. This confirmation from a reliable source adds credibility to the claim's inauthenticity."}
