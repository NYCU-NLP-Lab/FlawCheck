{"Number of apprehensions": "The expert's verdict provides the actual number of apprehensions made so far in fiscal year 2019, which is 268,044. This number is significantly lower than the claim of \"more than one million people\" made by President Trump.", "Monthly average": "The expert's verdict mentions that the monthly average of apprehensions in fiscal year 2019 is 53,609. Based on this average, the projected number of apprehensions for the entire fiscal year would be 643,306, which is still far below the claimed figure.", "Historical data": "The expert's verdict compares the projected number of apprehensions for fiscal year 2019 with previous years. It states that the last time the U.S. had over 1 million apprehensions was in fiscal year 2006, with 1,071,972 people apprehended. This historical data further supports the fact that the claim is not authentic.", "Inadmissibles": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim made by President Trump does not differentiate between apprehensions and inadmissibles. Inadmissibles are individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible. The expert's verdict provides the number of apprehensions (66,450) and inadmissibles (9,653) for February, totaling 76,103 \"encounters.\" This distinction further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
