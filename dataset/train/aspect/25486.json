{"The claim was debunked by Kaeli Swift": "a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington, who specializes in ornithology and wildlife ecology. She stated that birds cannot eject their internal organs under any circumstances.", "Sharon Stiteler": "a park ranger and bird expert, confirmed that the photo used in the claim actually showed a type of stork called a shoebill, not a pelican.", "Kaeli Swift explained in a video that when pelicans yawn or stretch their mouths": "their pouch under their beak stretches over their neck, which technically contains their spine. However, this does not mean that the spine is coming out of their body.", "The Chicago Zoological Society": "s Brookfield Zoo tweeted that the fibrous skin under a pelican's bill, called the \"gular pouch,\" is often expanded while feeding, but there is no evidence to suggest that pelicans can invert their pouch or remove their spines."}
