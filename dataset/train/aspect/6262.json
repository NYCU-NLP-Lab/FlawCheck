{"The image dates back to at least 2016": "Alt News performed a keyword search on Facebook and found that the viral image of a Sikh man praying in a mosque was posted in January 2016 by a Doha-based Facebook user. This indicates that the image is not related to the recent farmers' protest.", "Lack of identification of the man in the image": "Alt News couldn't identify the man in the image or provide any details about his location. This suggests that there is no concrete evidence linking the image to the claim that a Sikh man attended a Kissan Rally and forgot to remove his headgear upon returning to the mosque.", "Sharing of the image with false claims": "The image was shared on social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, with false claims suggesting that a Muslim man posed as a Sikh farmer in the ongoing protests. This highlights the spread of misinformation and the need to verify claims before sharing them.", "Verification through expert analysis": "The expert's verdict, as provided by Alt News, states that the image is not authentic and does not support the claim made by the original tweet. The expert analysis helps to debunk the false claim and provides a factual evaluation of the image's authenticity."}
