{"Analysis of government spending": "The experts analyzed government expenditures as a percentage of the national gross domestic product (GDP) from 1996 to 2010. They found that government spending had been relatively stable, ranging between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. However, it increased to approximately 38 percent in 2009 and 2010, approaching the 40 percent mentioned by Mitt Romney.", "Input from diverse economists and business experts": "The experts consulted a group of economists and business experts with varying ideological backgrounds to gather different perspectives on the claim. This ensured a comprehensive analysis of the issue.", "Evaluation of the economic impact": "The experts considered the potential consequences of increased government spending on economic freedom. They found that most of the experts they spoke to dismissed the suggestion that a government share of GDP close to 40 percent would be catastrophic for economic freedom.", "Examination of the timeline": "The experts pointed out that the growth in government's footprint in GDP began in 2008, during the Bush administration, due to the impact of the recession. This challenges Romney's implication that the increase in spending was solely attributable to President Obama's policies."}
