{"Commissioner Tim G": "Echols' statement in Power Engineering magazine: The expert's verdict includes a quote from Commissioner Tim G. Echols where he states that \"Our state has no major rivers to produce big hydro power.\" This statement is presented as the claim that needs to be verified for authenticity.", "Existence of hydroelectric facilities in Georgia": "The expert's verdict mentions the Morgan Falls dam area along the Chattahoochee river, which is part of Georgia Power's network of hydroelectric facilities across Georgia. This information contradicts the claim that Georgia has no major rivers for hydropower.", "Georgia Energy Report": "The 2014 Georgia Energy Report by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority is referenced to support the existence of hydroelectric power generation in Georgia. The report states that hydroelectric generated 2 percent of power generation and 5.5 percent of capacity in 2012, contradicting the claim made by Commissioner Echols.", "U": "S. Department of Energy report: The expert's verdict mentions a 1998 report for the U.S. Department of Energy that evaluated Georgia's undeveloped hydropower potential. The report found that Georgia has a significant undeveloped hydropower potential, ranging from about 613 megawatts to 1,137 megawatts of power. This information further contradicts the claim that Georgia has no major rivers for hydropower."}
