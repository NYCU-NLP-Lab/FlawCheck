{"Expert": "s opinion: The expert, Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at UC-Irvine, stated that he does not believe it is possible for non-citizen voters to have been responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. This expert opinion adds credibility to the claim verification process.", "Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert mentioned that there is no evidence to support the claim that non-citizen voters played a role in Obama's victory. This lack of supporting evidence weakens the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate data": "The expert highlighted the flaws in the data used to support the claim. The study that suggested non-citizen voting was based on a small sample size and had errors in the survey responses. This inaccuracy in the data further undermines the claim's credibility.", "Irrelevant information": "The expert also pointed out that the claim mentioned the possibility of non-citizen voters obtaining driver's licenses, but North Carolina does not allow such immigrants to get licenses at all. This discrepancy in the claim's details raises doubts about its validity."}
