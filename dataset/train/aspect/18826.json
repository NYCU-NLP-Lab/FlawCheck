{"Contextual manipulation": "The expert points out that Delaware Gov. Jack Markell cherry-picked Mitt Romney's words and put them in a context that Romney never intended. Markell used Romney's statement about liking to fire people in the context of joblessness and the economy, when Romney was actually talking about health insurance providers and individual choice.", "Original intention": "The expert highlights that Mitt Romney's statement about liking to fire people was made in the context of discussing the ability to choose one's own health insurance provider. Romney clarified that his comments entirely reflected that discussion and the need for individuals to have the freedom to make choices.", "Acknowledgment of potential misinterpretation": "The expert mentions that Romney was aware that his statement could be taken out of context and used against him by opponents. He acknowledged that opponents, like the Obama campaign, could use the statement to misrepresent his stance on firing people.", "Reciprocal behavior": "The expert notes that both Mitt Romney and President Obama have taken each other's statements out of context and used them to their advantage. The expert mentions that Romney did the same thing to Obama with the \"you didn't build that\" line, which was repeated by speakers at the Republican National Convention. This aspect highlights the reciprocal nature of political campaigns and the use of selective quoting."}
