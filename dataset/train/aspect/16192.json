{"Lack of specific details": "The expert notes that Trump's claim lacks specific details such as the years or regions in which the thousands of killings occurred. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to verify the claim accurately.", "Absence of a national database": "The expert highlights the challenge in finding concrete numbers due to the absence of a national database or study tracking the number of people killed by undocumented immigrants. This lack of data further complicates the verification process.", "Some undocumented immigrants commit violent crimes": "The expert acknowledges that while the rate of murder among undocumented immigrants may vary compared to other groups, it is not zero. This suggests that there are instances of violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, but it does not provide evidence for the claim of \"thousands\" of Americans being killed.", "Overall murder statistics": "The expert mentions that there are approximately 16,000 murders in America each year. While this statistic does not specifically address the claim, it provides context and suggests that the number of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants may not be as high as claimed."}
