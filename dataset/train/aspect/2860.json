{"Lack of evidence": "The expert, Dr. Eric Peters, stated that in the last 10 years, there have been no deaths due to beheadings or any beheading associated with deaths in Pima County, Arizona. He mentioned that the majority of deaths were caused by exposure to extreme weather conditions, and the remaining deaths were related to human smuggling accidents. This lack of evidence contradicts the claim made by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.", "Statistical data": "Dr. Eric Peters provided statistical data to support his statement. He mentioned that approximately 1,700 deaths occurred in the last 10 years in Pima County, and none of them were a result of beheadings. He further explained that over 95 percent of deaths were due to exposure, and less than 5 percent were related to human smuggling accidents. This statistical data adds credibility to his assessment and undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert testimony": "Dr. Eric Peters is identified as the deputy chief medical examiner for Pima County, which has the largest border with Mexico in Arizona. As an expert in his field, his testimony carries weight and authority. His expertise and professional experience make him a reliable source to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Animal decomposition explanation": "Dr. Eric Peters provided a scientific explanation for the presence of skulls or disarticulated heads in the desert. He stated that as a body decomposes, local animals use the deceased as a food source, which can lead to the disarticulation of the head from the spine. This explanation suggests a natural process rather than violent beheadings as the cause of such findings."}
