{"Official roll call vote": "The expert looked at the official roll call vote on the mental health amendment and found that it had passed by a 95-2 vote in the Senate on April 18. This verifies that the claim of the amendment receiving over 90 votes in the Senate is accurate.", "Ayotte": "s statements and actions: The expert examined statements and actions of U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who co-sponsored the mental health amendment. Ayotte had expressed strong bipartisan support for mental health provisions related to mass shootings and introduced the Mental Health First Aid Act. This provides evidence that Ayotte was actively involved in advocating for mental health programs.", "Joint statement with Sen": "Mark Begich: The expert noted that Ayotte and Sen. Mark Begich issued a joint statement advocating for programs to educate teachers in recognizing symptoms of mental health illness. This demonstrates Ayotte's commitment to addressing mental health issues and suggests that there was support for such programs.", "Mixed voting record": "The expert highlighted Ayotte's mixed voting record on gun control proposals. While she voted for the mental health amendment, she later voted against a gun control proposal that would have expanded background checks. This inconsistency in her voting drew criticism from critics. While not directly verifying the claim, it provides additional context and raises questions about Ayotte's stance on mental health provisions related to mass shootings."}
