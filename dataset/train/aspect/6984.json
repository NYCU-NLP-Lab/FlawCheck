{"The claim falsely states that pedophilia is now legal in California": "allowing a 21-year-old to have sex with an 11-year-old without being listed as a sex offender. The expert's verdict confirms that this claim is false.", "The expert": "s verdict emphasizes that the bill does not reduce the standards for statutory rape. Existing law already allows judges to decide whether to place offenders on the sex offender registry in cases involving vaginal intercourse. Therefore, the claim's implication that the bill legalizes sex with minors is unfounded.", "Instead of automatically registering offenders": "the bill proposes that a judge would decide whether to register for life those convicted of voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and who are within 10 years of age of the victim. This aspect of the bill demonstrates that the claim's assertion of no consequences for engaging in sex with minors is inaccurate."}
