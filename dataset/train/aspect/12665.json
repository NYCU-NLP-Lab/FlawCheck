{"The New York State appellate court upheld the standing custody arrangement between Bill O": "Reilly and his wife, indicating that there was no change or loss of custody due to domestic violence or any other salacious reason.", "The court documents did not suggest that O": "Reilly \"lost custody\" of his children because of physical attacks on their mother. The claim that O'Reilly's \"young daughter\" was 17 at the time of the ruling also contradicts the notion of him losing custody.", "Available court documents did not support the assertion that altercations between O": "Reilly and his former wife factored into the court's decision.", "The article published by": "Occupy Democrats\" did not back the headline's assertions and misinterpreted the court document, stating that O'Reilly specifically lost custody due to a \"vicious domestic violence incident.\" The court document actually stated that it was in the best interest of the children to remain in their mother's care."}
