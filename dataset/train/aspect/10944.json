{"The size of the coronavirus": "The expert mentions that the claim in the viral text about the size of the coronavirus being 400-500 micro is invalid. They provide information that coronaviruses are approximately 125 nm in size, which is smaller than bacteria and human cells.", "Effectiveness of masks": "The expert highlights the contradictory claim made by the U.S. Surgeon General, who advised against the use of masks for the general public. The Surgeon General states that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching the coronavirus. However, the expert also mentions that masks on an infected person can prevent water droplets with the virus from dispersing into the air.", "Transmission methods": "The expert explains that the main method of transmission for the coronavirus or other respiratory tract viruses is through air transmission. They mention that masks can prevent water droplets with the virus from entering the air, but the virus can still penetrate through masks via tiny viral clusters and through the eyes.", "Expert opinion": "The expert refers to David Hui, a respiratory medicine expert, who states that wearing masks is \"common sense\" based on his extensive study of the SARS outbreak. While this is not a direct aspect employed to verify the claim, it provides an additional perspective on the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses."}
