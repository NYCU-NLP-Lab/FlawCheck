{"Claims of hair resale": "One aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the allegation that Locks of Love resells the majority of donated hair to make commercially-vended wigs. This claim suggests that the charity may not be using the hair for its intended purpose of providing free wigs to children with medical conditions.", "Limited free hairpieces": "Another aspect is the accusation that Locks of Love provides very few free hairpieces relative to the volume of hair donated each year. This raises concerns about whether the charity is efficiently utilizing the donated hair to benefit those in need.", "Charging ailing children": "The claim also includes the allegation that Locks of Love charges exorbitant prices to ailing children for the wigs they receive. This aspect questions the charity's commitment to providing affordable or free wigs to those who cannot afford them.", "Rigorous screening process": "Lastly, the claim suggests that Locks of Love subjects children with cancer to a rigorous screening process, potentially denying wigs to those with a dim prognosis. This aspect raises concerns about the charity's selection criteria and whether it prioritizes those in greatest need."}
