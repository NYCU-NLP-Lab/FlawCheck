{"Longevity of the image": "The expert mentions that the image has been circulating online since at least 2013, indicating that it has been in existence for a considerable period of time.", "Evolution of the image": "s context: Originally shared with joke captions unrelated to animals seeking shelter in cars during winter, the image gained viral attention only when it was attached to such warnings. This evolution in the image's context suggests that it was not originally intended to convey the claim being made.", "Source credibility": "The expert mentions the official Twitter account for the Roads Policing Unit in Surrey, England, as one of the first to combine the image with the warning. This suggests that the image was likely used as a joke to grab people's attention, rather than being a genuine representation of a cow seeking warmth on a car hood.", "Digital manipulation": "The expert points out that the cow in the image was digitally manipulated into the wintry scene. This manipulation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests that the image was altered for humorous or attention-grabbing purposes."}
