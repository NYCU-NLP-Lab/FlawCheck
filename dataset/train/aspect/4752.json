{"The video evidence": "The expert would have analyzed the video itself to determine if it is authentic and if it shows a Dalit man being fed water from a shoe by upper-caste men. They would have looked for any signs of manipulation or editing that could indicate a false claim.", "Source credibility": "The expert would have examined the sources that shared the video, such as the South Asian Human Rights Watch and the Twitter users mentioned. They would have assessed the credibility and reputation of these sources to determine if they are reliable and trustworthy.", "Contextual information": "The expert would have gathered additional information about the incident, such as the location, date, and any other relevant details. They would have cross-referenced this information with other sources or reports to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Previous instances": "The expert would have investigated whether similar incidents or claims have been reported in the past. They would have looked for any patterns or trends that could support or contradict the current claim. In this case, the expert mentions that the same video had gone viral two years ago with similar claims, indicating a possible pattern of caste-based violence."}
