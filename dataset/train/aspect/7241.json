{"The claim is based on articles published by several political news and opinion websites": "including DemocraticReview.com and LeftLiberal.com, which assert that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is to be disbarred in Alabama.", "The claim mentions that a complaint against Sessions": "allegedly co-signed by close to 2,000 attorneys, was submitted to the Alabama State Bar Disciplinary Committee by an anti-Trump activist group called Lawyers for Good Government.", "The complaint seeks Sessions": "disbarment based on allegations of four different types of professional misconduct committed during his time as Attorney General.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the mere filing of the complaint does not guarantee that Sessions will be disbarred, as it is up to the disciplinary committee to evaluate the merits of the complaint. The fact that it was submitted by a group with an overtly partisan agenda may also impact the committee's evaluation."}
