{"Obama": "s tax policy was a result of compromises with Senate Republicans in 2010, which left income tax rates unchanged for all tax brackets. This was necessary to prevent the expiration of tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush.", "However": "Obama's claim that \"I didn't raise taxes once\" is false. He has raised taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning, and the health care law includes a tax penalty on the uninsured. The health care law also includes new taxes on the wealthy, increasing the rates they pay on Medicare hospital taxes starting in 2013.", "The tax cuts implemented by Obama": "known as Making Work Pay, provided small increases in people's paychecks. This was done to stimulate the economy, as the Obama administration believed that people would be more likely to spend the money if given in smaller increments."}
