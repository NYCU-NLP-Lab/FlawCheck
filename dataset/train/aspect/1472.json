{"Life expectancy comparison": "The expert verified the claim about the average life expectancy by referring to a 2006 Congressional Research Service report and recent data from the Centers for Disease Control. The report confirmed that in 1950, the average American lived for 68.1 years, while in 2010, the average life expectancy was 78.7 years, supporting the claim made by U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf.", "Worker": "to-retiree ratio: To validate the claim regarding the number of workers supporting each Social Security recipient, the expert referred to a fact-check conducted by PolitiFact Georgia in April 2011. The fact-check examined a similar claim made by Mark Warner, D-Va., and referenced historical data from the 2010 Social Security Trustees report. The expert also analyzed the latest trustees report from 2011, which revealed that in 1950, there were 16.5 employees for every Social Security recipient, while in 2011, there were 2.9 workers for every retiree, confirming the claim.", "Factors influencing the worker": "to-retiree ratio: The expert explained that the decline in the worker-to-retiree ratio is influenced by various factors. One factor is the expansion of eligibility for Social Security benefits over the years, allowing workers from professions such as farmers and state/local employees to become eligible. Additionally, the eligibility age for receiving Social Security payments was lowered from 65 to 62 in the 1950s and 1960s. These demographic changes contribute to the decrease in the ratio.", "Expert opinions": "The expert included opinions from economists and experts to support the claim's authenticity. Henry Aaron, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained that the ratio changed due to Americans living longer and retiring earlier. Bob Pozen, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, also supported the claim by stating that the ratio has changed because of increased longevity and earlier retirement. These expert opinions strengthen the verification of the claim."}
