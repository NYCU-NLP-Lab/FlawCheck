{"The claim is debunked by stating that none of the four terrorists who hijacked Flight 93 on 9": "11 was named \"Alqadib Aleimlaq,\" came from the United Arab Emirates, or was a cousin of Rep. Ilhan Omar. The hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Rep. Omar's family is from Somalia.", "The false report originated solely from a network of junk news sites called America": "s Last Line of Defense (LLOD), which is known for engaging in puerile political trolling under the guise of offering \"satire.\" This highlights the lack of credibility of the source.", "The LLOD article falsely claiming Rep": "Omar's cousin to be a terrorist was quickly deleted after its publication, indicating that it was recognized as false and potentially defamatory.", "Another example of a defamatory LLOD article": "which falsely claimed that a U.S. Army sergeant killed by terrorists in Niger was a deserter, further undermines the credibility and reliability of the source."}
