{"The claim falsely states that people receiving authorized COVID": "19 vaccines are participating in a deadly clinical trial, which is not true. The vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective, and people consent to receive them voluntarily.", "The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems": "including the v-safe reporting tool, have identified only a few very rare adverse events related to the COVID-19 vaccines. This indicates that the vaccines have undergone intensive safety monitoring and have a good safety profile.", "More than half a billion doses of COVID": "19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S., and the majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects or no side effects at all. The vaccines have been extensively monitored for safety, making them the most intensively monitored vaccines in U.S. history.", "While a small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis have occurred with the authorized COVID": "19 vaccines, these reactions are rare, treatable, and expected with any vaccine. The incidence of anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is extremely low, with approximately 5 cases per million vaccinated individuals, according to the CDC."}
