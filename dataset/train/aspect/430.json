{"The claim that California will automatically register illegal aliens to vote is based on a misinterpretation of the California New Motor Voter Program": "which allows Californians to automatically register to vote when they renew their driver's license.", "The California New Motor Voter Program does not include undocumented immigrants as eligible voters": "as they are not able to obtain a driver's license in the state.", "The California Secretary of State": "s Office is responsible for verifying the name and citizenship information of individuals who are eligible to register to vote through the program.", "The California Department of Motor Vehicles has programming measures in place to prevent undocumented residents from being registered to vote": "ensuring that only eligible individuals are included in the voter registration process."}
