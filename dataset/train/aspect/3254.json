{"The claim is based on a rumor started by Charlie Kirk": "founder of Turning Point USA, who tweeted about sending \"80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president.\" However, Kirk provided no evidence to support this claim.", "The link between Ginni Thomas and Turning Point USA is outdated": "While Thomas was once on the \"Advisory Council\" for Turning Point USA, she has not served in that role since at least early 2019, according to Turning Point USA's website.", "Thomas": "promotion of the protests and praise for the participants on social media is true. Slate reporter Mark Joseph Stern highlighted her enthusiastic support for the demonstrations.", "The claim originated from a user": "submitted blog post on the left-wing site DailyKos, which tied Thomas to Turning Point USA and other right-wing political organizations involved in the rally. However, the blog post's argument is based on tweets and unverified connections rather than concrete evidence."}
