{"The video": "s source and original date: The expert conducted a reverse image search and found that the video was originally uploaded on YouTube in September 2012, with an Arabic description referring to an attack on the American Embassy in Sudan. This indicates that the video is not recent and does not support the claim of Muslims setting fire to the French embassy in Sudan.", "Historical context": "The expert found media reports from September 2012 stating that various foreign embassies in Sudan, including the American, British, and German embassies, were attacked during violent protests. These protests were in response to an 'anti-Islamic' scene in an American movie trailer, not related to the recent cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. The expert concluded that the viral video aligns with the visuals from the 2012 protests, further discrediting the claim.", "Social media sharing": "The expert noted that the viral video and accompanying claim were shared by several Twitter users with a significant number of followers. The fact that the video gained traction on social media platforms suggests that it was being circulated widely, but it does not verify the authenticity of the claim itself.", "Language analysis": "The expert highlighted that the complete message accompanying the viral video was in Hindi, which translates to a claim that Muslims set fire to the French embassy in Sudan in retaliation for perceived insults to Prophet Muhammad. However, the language used in the message does not provide any evidence or proof of the claim's authenticity."}
