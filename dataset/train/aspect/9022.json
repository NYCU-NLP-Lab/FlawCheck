{"The claim made by Donald Trump during the debate that he": "renegotiated it down to two hours\" was contradicted by moderator John Harwood, who stated that the debate was always going to be two hours.", "CNBC": "s initial announcement of the debate stated that it would be two hours long, further supporting Harwood's claim.", "CNBC had anticipated a total of 15 minutes of commercial time": "which would have made the whole program, including commercials, last around two hours and 15 minutes. This contradicts Trump's claim that the debate was supposed to be three hours.", "The letter sent by the Trump and Carson campaigns to CNBC": "s Washington bureau indicated that they agreed to a 120-minute debate that included commercial breaks and opening and closing statements. This further supports the fact that both campaigns were aware the program would last about two hours, even with commercials."}
