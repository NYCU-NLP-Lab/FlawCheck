{"The ad references a study from the American Enterprise Institute": "a conservative think tank, which focuses on the national debt and the payments needed to cover the interest on that debt.", "The study calculates that interest payments on the new debt added in Obama": "s first term equal $1,600 for households making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year.", "The study then projects the president": "s 2013 budget plan out to 2022 and calculates that the added payments during this period would total $2,400, resulting in the $4,000 figure mentioned in the ad.", "However": "the study does not describe a tax hike but rather a cost that must be paid, separate from the question of how it is paid, by whom, and when. Additionally, the study does not provide any specific plan from Obama to raise taxes on the middle class."}
