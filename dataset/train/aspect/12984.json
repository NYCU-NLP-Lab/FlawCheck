{"The claim was compared to a previous claim made by President Barack Obama during his 2016 State of the Union address": "where he stated that the US spends more on the military than the next eight nations combined. This comparison helps to establish the context and previous verification of similar claims.", "The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute": "SIPRI), a reputable think tank, was cited as the source used to verify Obama's claim. The expert also mentioned that PolitiFact relied on SIPRI's information to rate Obama's claim as Mostly True. This indicates that a reliable and independent source was used for verification.", "The expert mentioned that Sanders": "office cited a 2016 report by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) as the source for his claim. The report showed that the United States spent about $604.5 billion on its military, which was higher than the combined spending of the next 12 countries. The mention of a specific report and its findings adds credibility to the claim.", "The expert also noted that the most recent IISS report showed that the US spending is now ahead of the next 10 countries": "with a total spending of $602.8 billion compared to the combined spending of $593 billion by the next 10 countries. This information suggests that the claim may have been accurate at the time it was made, but the ranking has changed slightly in recent years."}
