{"Verification through visual evidence": "The expert analyzed videos and images from various sources to determine whether the Indian national flag was replaced with a Sikh flag on the Red Fort. They examined footage showing protestors unfurling Sikh religious flags (Nishan Sahib) from an empty flagstaff, indicating that the tricolour was not removed.", "Evaluation of eyewitness accounts": "The expert considered statements from farmer leaders who blamed certain individuals, such as actor Deep Sidhu and activist Lakha Sidhana, for hijacking the protests and inciting violence at the Red Fort. These accounts suggested that the flag replacement claim may have been a result of the actions of a few individuals rather than a widespread occurrence.", "Analysis of social media posts": "The expert examined posts from The Squint and The Squint Neon, known for spreading misinformation. They found a video shared by The Squint, which attempted to portray the Nishan Sahib being unfurled after taking down the tricolour. By analyzing the video, the expert determined that the Nishan Sahib was placed alongside the Indian national flag, rather than replacing it.", "Comparison with reliable media coverage": "The expert referred to a Punjabi channel's five-hour broadcast of the farmers' rally on January 26. By carefully watching the footage, they identified that the dome of the Red Fort remained empty throughout the protest. This observation further supported the conclusion that the Indian national flag was not replaced with a Sikh flag."}
