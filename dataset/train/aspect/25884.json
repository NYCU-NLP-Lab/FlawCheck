{"Lack of publicly available suicide rate statistics": "The expert points out that there are no publicly available statistics about suicide rates this year, let alone figures that show a 200% increase since the lockdown. National demographic data, including suicide rates, are usually known much later.", "Celebrity endorsements": "The claim was supported by celebrities like Kris Jenner, Viola Davis, Tina Knowles-Lawson, and Mark Kurian, who posted the same message and National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number to their millions of followers. However, celebrity endorsements do not provide concrete evidence for the claim's authenticity.", "Limited data on suicide deaths during the pandemic": "The expert explains that suicide deaths take a long time to identify, and national data on suicide deaths for the period reflecting the pandemic might not be available until January 2022. Therefore, it is premature to draw conclusions about suicide deaths during the lockdown based on current data.", "Lack of data on suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts": "The expert highlights that there is also limited information on suicide attempts and the number of people with suicidal thoughts during the pandemic. Without comprehensive data on these aspects, it is challenging to verify the claim of a 200% increase in suicides."}
