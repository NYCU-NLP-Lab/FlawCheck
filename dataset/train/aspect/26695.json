{"McAuliffe": "s claim of over 53,000 teachers over 50 years old was based on figures from the Virginia Retirement System (VRS), which manages public school pensions. However, the VRS data includes all full-time \"professional or clerical employees\" who are 50 or older, not just teachers. This means that administrators, counselors, and secretaries are also included in the count.", "The VRS data provided by McAuliffe": "s campaign is not specific to teachers and includes all full-time school division employees who have crossed the age threshold of 50. This means that the number of teachers over 50 is likely to be lower than the claimed 53,000.", "The correct denominator to determine the percentage of teachers over 50 is not the 98": "792 instructional staff figure from the state Department of Education presentation, but rather the total number of all full-time public school employees at the end of the last school year, which is 147,216. Using this denominator, the percentage of teachers over 50 is 38.3%, significantly lower than McAuliffe's claim of more than half.", "To obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of teachers over 50": "age data from the Virginia Department of Education should be considered. However, the information about the age of teachers, librarians, guidance counselors, and other instructional staff is not provided in the given text, making it difficult to determine the exact number of teachers who are 50 or older."}
