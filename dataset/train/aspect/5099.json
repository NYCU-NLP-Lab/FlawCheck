{"Multiple social media posts": "The claim was shared on various social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, by different users and pages, indicating its widespread circulation.", "Change in username": "The Twitter handle that initially shared the video changed its username, which could raise suspicions about the credibility of the claim.", "Car dealership identification": "The car seen in the video had the name \"Khivraj\" written on it, which led to the discovery that Khivraj Motors is a car dealer based in Chennai. This information could be used to verify the location of the video.", "Historical information and records": "Through further investigation, it was found that the video was originally uploaded in 2014 and featured a boy named Henry performing stunts on skates. Henry's records and achievements were documented on various websites, such as the \"India Book of Records\" and the \"Record Holders Republic,\" which provided evidence contradicting the claim that the boy in the video was Jamal Mallik from Mumbai."}
