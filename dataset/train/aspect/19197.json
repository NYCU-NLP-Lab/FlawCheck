{"Lack of evidence on official U": "S. Congress website: The expert notes that as of mid-January 2019, neither Rashida Tlaib nor Ilhan Omar were shown on the U.S. Congress website as having sponsored or co-sponsored any legislation, including legislation related to Islamic affairs. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Unlikelihood of first legislative endeavor": "The expert points out that it is unlikely for newly elected representatives to prioritize creating new federal holidays as their first legislative endeavor. The fact that the last time Congress designated a new federal holiday was in 1983 adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Fabricated source": "The expert highlights that the article making the claim was published on a website called \"So Right It Hurts,\" which has a disclaimer stating that its content is \"paradoxical\" and \"for parody purposes only.\" This indicates that the website is not a reliable source of information and suggests that the claim may be fabricated.", "Inconsistencies with historical context": "The expert mentions that the claim of adding Muslim holidays as federal holidays is inconsistent with the historical context of the United States as a primarily Christian nation. The claim of the representatives justifying their work as making America more inclusive of its Muslim-American population contradicts the lack of precedent for adding religious holidays to the federal calendar since Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in 1983."}
