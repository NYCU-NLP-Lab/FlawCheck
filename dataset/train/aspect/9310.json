{"The image was manipulated": "The expert determined that the image circulating on social media was manipulated and not an accurate representation of the original photograph.", "Original source of the manipulated image": "The expert identified that the manipulated image originally appeared on a \"satire\" website called World News Bureau, which carries a disclaimer stating that it is fictitious and any resemblance to real events is coincidental.", "Comparison with the original photograph": "The expert compared the manipulated image with the original photograph taken by Nedra Pickler during the swearing-in ceremony of Defense Secretary Ash Carter. The original image showed Vice President Joe Biden with his hands on Stephanie Carter's shoulders, rather than groping her breast as depicted in the manipulated image.", "Statements from the individuals involved": "The expert referenced statements made by Stephanie Carter and Ash Carter, where they both indicated that they were not offended by Biden's actions and that they were great friends with him. This suggests that the incident was not perceived as inappropriate or non-consensual."}
