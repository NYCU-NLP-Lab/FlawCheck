{"Confirmation from multiple sources": "The authenticity of the claim was verified by interviewing Crystal Ritzenthaler, the school district's superintendent; Kevin Vodak, the school board president; and Doug Mering, the board vice president. All three confirmed that milk was eliminated during morning snack for elementary school students in the 2011-2012 school year.", "Corroborating evidence from a news article": "The Wisconsin State Journal published an article about the Baraboo School District's decision to end the practice of providing milk with students' morning snack. This article supported Sharpton's claim that a school district in Wisconsin had stopped giving milk to elementary school kids due to concerns about state funding.", "Mention in various media sources": "The claim was mentioned in multiple media sources, including the Wisconsin Education Association Council's website, the Daily Kos blog, and the website of \"Fabulous Farm Babe\" Pam Jahnke. This widespread coverage further supported the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of response from MSNBC and National Action Network": "Despite reaching out to MSNBC and the National Action Network for evidence to back up Sharpton's statement, neither organization responded. This lack of response can be seen as an indirect confirmation of the claim, as they did not provide any evidence to dispute it."}
