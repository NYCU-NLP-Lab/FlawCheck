{"The claim is attributed to geologist Ian Rutherford Plimer": "known for writing the discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to downplay the impact of human activity on global climate.", "The claim states that a single volcanic eruption releases 10": "000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity throughout history, which is deemed false by the expert.", "The expert provides a comparison between the total mass of carbon dioxide released by human activity": "estimated at 936.5 gigatons) and the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated at 5,100,000 gigatons), demonstrating that human activity contributes only a small fraction to the overall atmospheric composition.", "The expert emphasizes that the focus should not be on the overall composition of the atmosphere but rather on the additional carbon dioxide that humans are adding and its potential to affect climate": "which is a topic supported by a wide scientific consensus."}
