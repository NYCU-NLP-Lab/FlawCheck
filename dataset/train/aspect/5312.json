{"Lack of comprehensive data": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is a lack of comprehensive data on the citizenship of illegal immigrants who are released. This indicates that it is difficult to verify the claim due to the unavailability of complete information.", "Limited number of apprehended individuals": "Within the universe of apprehended individuals, only a small number are from the countries mentioned by Carson (Iraq, Somalia, and Russia). This suggests that the claim of \"a lot\" of illegal immigrants from these countries being released is not supported by the available data.", "Specific cases of released criminals": "The expert's verdict provides specific examples of three criminal illegal immigrants who were released by ICE. These individuals were from Russia, Sudan, and Iraq, but not Somalia as mentioned by Carson. This indicates that while there have been cases of released criminals from these countries, the claim about \"a lot\" of them being released is not accurate.", "Supreme Court ruling and reporting requirements": "The expert's verdict mentions the Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas vs. Davis, which prevents ICE from indefinitely holding individuals if deportation is unlikely. The two foreign nationals mentioned in the verdict were released based on this ruling and were ordered to report regularly to an ICE officer. This aspect highlights the legal limitations on ICE's ability to detain certain individuals, further questioning the claim made by Carson."}
