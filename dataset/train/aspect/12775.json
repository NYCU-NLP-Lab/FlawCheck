{"The claim is based on an ad written by a SeaWorld veterinarian": "Chris Dold, which states that whales live as long at SeaWorld as they do in the wild.", "The ad references an independent study conducted by Dr": "Douglas DeMaster, of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which supports SeaWorld's claim.", "PETA": "an animal-rights group and critic of SeaWorld, disputes the claim and provides data on the average age of death for captive whales, suggesting a shorter lifespan compared to wild whales.", "The expert": "Dr. DeMaster, confirms that SeaWorld's claim is accurate but acknowledges that the data used is limited to the years 2005-2013, while PETA's data covers a longer period."}
