{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that no news accounts, government agencies, or other reliable sources have reported Pepsi or Frooti products being contaminated with HIV-infected blood. This indicates that there is a lack of credible evidence supporting the claim.", "Response from the company": "The parent company of Frooti, Parie Agro, responded to the rumor by posting a message on their Facebook page, calling it an \"unjustified rumor.\" This response suggests that the company denies the claim and provides a counterargument against it.", "Expert opinion from the CDC": "The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that there have been no reported incidents of food being contaminated with HIV-infected blood or semen. They also emphasize that HIV does not survive long outside the human body and that exposure to air, heat, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. This expert opinion adds credibility to the argument against the claim.", "Lack of transmission evidence": "The CDC states that contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in the transmission of HIV. This information reinforces the fact that the claim of HIV-contaminated beverages causing transmission is highly unlikely."}
