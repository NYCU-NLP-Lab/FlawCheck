The expert's verdict mentions that the debate involved discussions about Trump's worthiness as a candidate and other personal attacks.", "Mention of voter concerns about the national debt": "The expert's verdict includes a statement by Carly Fiorina during the debate where she mentions voter concerns over the nation's $18 trillion debt. This supports Rubio's claim that the national debt was not adequately addressed during the debate."}
