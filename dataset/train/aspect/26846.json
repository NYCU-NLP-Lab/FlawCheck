{"The claim originated from an entertainment website": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from the World News Daily Report (WNDR), which is known for publishing fictional and satirical content. This establishes the source of the claim and raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert mentions that the photographs accompanying the claim do not actually depict a 5-meter-tall human skeleton found in Australia. Instead, they show an archaeologist excavating the remains of a woolly mammoth in France. This discrepancy between the claim and the actual evidence undermines its credibility.", "Repackaging of content by third parties": "The expert notes that the claim was repackaged and shared by various sources online, including a YouTube page and a Facebook page. This highlights the spread of misinformation and the potential for the claim to be taken out of context or presented as genuine news, further questioning its authenticity.", "Expert opinion": "The expert quotes Professor Hans Zimmer from the University of Adelaide, who expresses surprise and skepticism about the discovery of a 5-meter-tall human skeleton. Zimmer acknowledges that such a finding would be theoretically impossible and raises more questions than answers. This expert opinion adds weight to the doubts surrounding the claim."}
