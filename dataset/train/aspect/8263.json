{"Expressions of a common theme": "The expert notes that a significant subset of e-mail forwards received expresses a theme that blacks are being overlooked and slighted by white Americans, particularly in the economic arena. This suggests that the claim about the discontinuation of Black Heritage series stamps fits into a larger pattern of claims about the neglect of black Americans.", "Historical context": "The expert provides examples of similar claims collected via e-mail in 2000 and 2007, indicating that this claim has been circulating for several years. This historical context helps to establish the claim's authenticity and demonstrates that it has been a recurring concern.", "Personal experience": "The expert recounts a personal experience of being informed by a postal worker that the African American Heritage stamps will be destroyed instead of being sold until depleted. The inclusion of this personal experience adds credibility to the claim and suggests that it is not merely a rumor or hearsay.", "Call to action": "The expert highlights a call to action, urging recipients of the message to request African-American stamps and to complain to the Post Master. This call to action indicates that there is a perceived urgency and importance attached to the claim, further reinforcing its authenticity."}
