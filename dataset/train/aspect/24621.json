{"The claim is based on a study entitled": "Small Business Survival Index 2009: Ranking the Policy Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation\" produced by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council (SBE), a trade group representing small businesses and advocating for less government regulation. This study evaluates states in 36 categories, including corporate and income taxes, gas and diesel taxes, government spending, health care and energy costs, inheritance taxes, and workers compensation costs.", "The rankings in the SBE study rely on hard numbers and objective evaluation of the various factors that business owners and entrepreneurs consider when choosing a location": "This makes the study more reliable than surveys of CEOs or other business professionals that may not rely on concrete data.", "Ohio ranks 11th overall in the 2009 SBE index": "which supports the claim made by the governor. However, the ranking of being 1st in the Midwest depends on the definition of the Midwest. The Ohio Business Development Coalition defines the Midwest as Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, while the U.S. Census Bureau includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota but excludes Kentucky. Therefore, Ohio's ranking as 1st in the Midwest may vary depending on the definition used.", "The claim also mentions that South Dakota tops the SBE": "s entire survey, indicating that it outranks Ohio in terms of overall business climate. The reason for South Dakota's high ranking is not mentioned, but it suggests that Ohio may not necessarily be the top-ranked state in the nation for business climate according to the SBE study."}
