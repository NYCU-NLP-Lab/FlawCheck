{"Misinterpretation of a preliminary and unpublished research paper": "The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a research paper that analyzed autopsy results of COVID-19 patients. The claim suggests that the research paper concluded that COVID-19 is caused by bacteria, which is not accurate.", "Baseless assertion of a global conspiracy": "The claim includes the baseless assertion that the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated a ban on performing autopsies on COVID-19 victims. This conspiracy theory adds an element of paranoia to the claim and implies a global cover-up.", "Italian researchers": "analysis of autopsy results: The only factual element of the claim is that Italian researchers did analyze autopsy results of COVID-19 patients. They published a research study based on post-mortem lung analyses, which revealed the presence of a condition known as Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) as a predominant feature.", "Presence of clotting cells in patients": "lungs: The research study also found the presence of clotting cells known as \"platelet-fibrin thrombi\" in the patients' lungs. This finding suggested a potential connection between blood clotting complications and COVID-19, but it does not support the claim that COVID-19 is caused by bacteria or that it can be treated with aspirin."}
