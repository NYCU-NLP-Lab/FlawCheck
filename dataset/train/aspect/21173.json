{"Increase in the number of charter schools": "The expert's verdict mentions that there were three charter schools in Virginia when McDonnell became governor in January 2010, and now there are six. This increase in the number of charter schools can be considered as evidence of the claim.", "Comparison with national statistics": "The expert also cites data from the National Center for Education Statistics and the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, which show the number of charter schools across the country. While this comparison doesn't directly verify the claim, it provides context and shows how Virginia's charter school expansion compares to other states.", "Resistance from local officials": "The expert mentions that charter schools have encountered resistance from local officials in Virginia. This resistance can be seen as evidence that expanding charter schools was not an easy task, further supporting the claim that McDonnell's administration successfully expanded them.", "Legislative efforts to promote charter schools": "The expert mentions two legislative efforts backed by McDonnell to promote charter schools. One was a bill that would have allowed the state Board of Education to override local rejections of charter schools, and the other established a state panel of experts to help prospective charter schools. These legislative efforts demonstrate McDonnell's commitment to expanding charter schools and can be considered as evidence supporting the claim."}
