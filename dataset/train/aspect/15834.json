{"The claim is based on a photograph that is frequently shared on Tumblr": "showing a man being prodded by two doctors. This photograph is used to support the story of a man who saw and communicated with dead people and talked to God after being deprived of his senses during a government experiment.", "The photograph used in the claim is actually a summarized version of a piece titled": "Gateway of the Mind\" from the Creepypasta horror fiction website. It was originally published in November 2009, suggesting that the claim is a fictional story rather than a real event.", "Although the photograph does not depict a man being stripped of his senses": "it is a real photograph from a government experiment. The image reportedly shows a \"Tuskegee study subject\" undergoing a spinal tap to obtain spinal fluid for neurosyphilis testing. This aspect confirms that the photograph used in the claim is unrelated to the alleged government experiment involving deprivation of senses.", "The expert providing the verdict is identified as Dan Evon": "a former writer for Snopes. This information establishes the credibility and expertise of the person evaluating the claim."}
