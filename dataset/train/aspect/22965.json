{"The claim was published by a New Zealand": "based Facebook user on July 20, 2020, and has been shared more than 430 times.", "The post compares the response to COVID": "19 with the swine flu (H1N1) virus outbreak, stating that there were 56 million more cases of COVID-19 to go until reaching the swine flu figures.", "The claim is misleading as it references US swine flu cases": "while COVID-19 is a global pandemic declared by the WHO in March 2020, with the first major outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019.", "Expert opinions": "including the WHO and Associate Professor Helen Petousis from The University of Auckland, state that COVID-19 is far more serious and deadly compared to the swine flu. The mortality rate and number of deaths from COVID-19 far surpass those of the swine flu, and a greater proportion of COVID-19 cases require hospital treatment."}
