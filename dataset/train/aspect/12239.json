{"Verification through direct communication": "The fact-checker contacted Travis Myren, the director of administration for Dane County, who provided information on the claimed reductions and confirmed the authenticity of the claim.", "Examination of supporting evidence": "The fact-checker requested evidence from Falk's spokesperson, Melissa Mulliken, who provided comments attributed to Travis Myren that detailed $9.4 million in reductions. This evidence was then cross-referenced with Myren himself to ensure its accuracy.", "Analysis of multiple initiatives": "Myren explained that the $9.4 million in savings were the result of three initiatives implemented by Falk, which were agreed upon by public employee unions and applied to all 2,200 county workers. These initiatives included a temporary pay cut, changes to health benefits, and other cost-saving measures.", "Consideration of additional agreement": "Myren mentioned a fourth agreement that would put the savings over $10 million, indicating that there was further evidence supporting the claim beyond the initial $9.4 million in reductions."}
