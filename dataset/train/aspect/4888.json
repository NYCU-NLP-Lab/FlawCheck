{"The claim made by Rick Santorum was that the cost": "of-living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation.", "The expert": "s analysis found that Santorum's claim is incorrect. The cost-of-living increase in Social Security is actually determined by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a federal statistic.", "The expert explains that the CPI": "W is a subset of the more widely known inflation statistic called CPI-U, and both measures reflect the buying habits of urban residents.", "The expert also mentions that the cost": "of-living adjustments (COLAs) provided by Social Security are automatic and are based on the CPI-W, meaning they are not directly tied to wage inflation as Santorum claimed."}
