{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that \"18 million illegal immigrants\" received \"government checks\" during the government shutdown. This lack of evidence casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Ineligibility for federal benefits": "The expert explains that immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for most federal benefits. This fact contradicts the claim that millions of unauthorized immigrants have been receiving money from the government.", "Contradiction with official data": "The expert mentions various estimates of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country, ranging from 10.7 million to 22.1 million. However, these numbers do not align with the claim of 18 million illegal immigrants receiving government checks.", "Legal restrictions and verification systems": "The expert highlights that unauthorized immigrants are barred from cash and in-kind public benefit programs, federal employment, and that applications for these programs and positions are screened through verification systems like SAVE and E-Verify. These restrictions further undermine the plausibility of the claim."}
