{"Lack of evidence of an international arrest warrant": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Inaccurate sourcing and misrepresentation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim combines unrelated information about Soros groups in Russia and quotes from a Rolling Stone article that have nothing to do with Soros. This inaccurate sourcing and misrepresentation of information raises doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Social media flags and online hoaxes": "The expert's verdict mentions that Facebook users flagged the post as potentially fabricated, indicating that the claim may be part of online hoaxes. The presence of similar hoaxes about Soros and Putin circulating since November 2016 further questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Discrepancies in language and quotes": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim uses language similar to that used by Russian officials when banning two Soros charities in 2015. However, the claim misrepresents this language to suggest that Russia declared Soros and his organizations a \"threat to Russian national security.\" Additionally, the claim includes quotes from a Rolling Stone article that do not mention Soros, attempting to create a false connection. These discrepancies in language and quotes cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
