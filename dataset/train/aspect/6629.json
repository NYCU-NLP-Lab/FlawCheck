{"Examination of campaign donations": "The expert checked the Center for Responsive Politics website to verify the amount of money Kendrick Meek received from the tobacco industry in his 2008 Congressional race and 2010 U.S. Senate race. The amounts obtained confirmed that Meek received significant funding from the tobacco industry, making him the top recipient among Florida candidates for House or Senate.", "Verification of claim specificity": "The expert noted that the claim made by Meek's opponent, Jeff Greene, stated that Meek was \"#1 in Florida\" in taking tobacco cash. The expert attempted to determine if this claim was limited to federal candidates or included candidates for state Legislature as well. However, due to the lack of comprehensive data on tobacco donations to all candidates across Florida, the expert was unable to conclusively verify the claim's specificity.", "Analysis of voting record": "The expert examined Kendrick Meek's voting record on the U.S. Library of Congress website, specifically focusing on bills related to raising taxes on the tobacco industry to support children's health care. It was found that Meek had consistently voted in favor of such bills in 2007 and 2009, contradicting the claim that he opposed a tax on cigars.", "Exploration of behind": "the-scenes lobbying: The expert discovered that while Meek publicly supported bills to raise taxes on the tobacco industry, he had also assisted Miami cigar maker Jorge Padron in securing meetings with top Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. These meetings were intended to allow Padron to lobby against higher taxes, indicating a potential conflict of interest despite Meek's voting record."}
