{"The expert cites an article by Estately": "a real estate search site, that aggregates seven different measures of soccer's popularity in each of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C. These measures include Facebook and Google interest, the number of professional teams, and youth soccer clubs per capita.", "The top": "seven \"soccer-enthused\" states, according to Estately, were all states President Barack Obama carried in 2012, including Maryland, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts. Texas and Utah, the only states carried by Mitt Romney in 2012 to crack the top 13, ranked eighth and 10th, respectively.", "Out of the 10 states ranked least enthusiastic about soccer by Estately": "only Maine went to Obama in 2012. The rest of the states, such as Alabama, Idaho, Arkansas, and Mississippi, did not vote for Obama.", "The expert also mentions three major demographics that contribute to the shift in soccer interest": "immigrants from \"soccer-mad nations\" in South America, young people, and political liberals. These demographics are referred to as the \"Obama coalition\" and are seen as more receptive to soccer."}
