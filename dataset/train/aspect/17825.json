{"Lack of evidence in news articles and TV segments": "PolitiFact New Jersey found that five news articles and two TV segments about Ocean Spray's move did not mention any connection between the decision and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). This lack of evidence suggests that the claim may not be authentic.", "Information from a spokesperson": "Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, confirmed that State Sen. Diane Allen's comments were based on information she received from cranberry grower Bill Haines Jr. However, Haines did not respond to inquiries, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Statement from Ocean Spray": "Ocean Spray's company spokesman, John Isaf, stated in an email that higher energy rates did play a role in the decision to move the processing facility, but not specifically because of the RGGI program. Isaf listed several other factors that influenced the decision, including lower energy costs, improved transportation and distribution logistics, proximity to supply chain partners and customers, lower labor costs, and other utility cost advantages.", "Overall assessment of multiple factors": "The expert's verdict mentions that the decision to move the facility was based on a variety of factors, as stated by Ocean Spray's spokesman. This suggests that the claim's attribution of the move largely to the costs associated with the RGGI may not accurately reflect the complete picture."}
