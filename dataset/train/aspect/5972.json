{"The bill": "s history: The expert considered the history of similar bills in the past, noting that bills with the same language have passed the House and Senate but have never been able to muster a majority vote from both chambers during the same year.", "Voting records": "The expert examined the voting records of the five Democratic senators mentioned in the claim (Creigh Deeds, Henry Marsh, Ken Alexander, Phil Puckett, and John Miller). It was found that some of them had previously supported similar legislation, while others had voted against it.", "Reasons for opposition": "The expert took into account the reasons provided by the senators for their opposition to the bill. It was mentioned that concerns about the enforceability of the bill were raised during a hearing by Senator Charles Carrico Sr., who stated that issuing a tailgating ticket is a judgement call by police that's tough to make stick in court unless there's been an accident.", "Political motivations": "The expert considered the possibility of political motivations behind the senators' opposition to the bill. Supporters of Del. Barbara Comstock accused the Democrats of switching their stance to undermine her in her congressional race. However, it is unclear if this aspect was given significant weight in determining the authenticity of the claim."}
