{"The timing discrepancy": "The expert's investigation revealed that the claim falsely stated that the church bombing occurred in March 2019, while the actual incident took place in January 2019. This inconsistency in timing raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Discrepancy in the number of casualties": "The claim asserted that 30 Christians were killed in the church bombing, whereas the verified information confirms that 20 people lost their lives in the attack. This difference in the reported number of casualties questions the reliability of the claim.", "Media coverage": "The expert found evidence to refute the claim that the media ignored the incident. Major news outlets such as CNN, the New York Times, and the Associated Press provided coverage of the church bombing, indicating that the claim was unfounded.", "Purposeful misinformation": "The expert identified a Facebook post that was likely shared with the intention of supporting the false claim. The post deliberately referenced a terrorist attack on a church in the Philippines with incorrect timing and casualty figures, suggesting an attempt to manipulate public perception and create the illusion of media negligence."}
