{"The claim is based on a six": "second Facebook ad by the Committee to Defend the President, a political group supporting President Donald Trump. The ad takes Biden's words out of context to brand him as a KKK sympathizer who used the \"N-word\" twice on camera.", "The Committee to Defend the President has also produced longer versions of the ad that contain additional claims": "such as Biden partnering with segregationists. While Biden did work with lawmakers who were segregationists during his time as a senator, the ad's portrayal may be misleading.", "The group has been promoting the ads specifically to Facebook users in the swing state of North Carolina": "which has a significant number of electoral votes. This indicates a strategic targeting of older voters in a key battleground state.", "When asked for evidence to support their claims": "the committee only provided Biden's remarks about late Senator Robert Byrd, who was a former KKK member. However, the context of Biden's remarks at a memorial service suggests a personal relationship with Byrd rather than praise for his KKK involvement."}
