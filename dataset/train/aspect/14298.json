{"Hillary Clinton": "s whereabouts: The expert's verdict confirms that Hillary Clinton was in the U.S. all weekend, specifically in Washington, D.C., and New York City. This information contradicts the claim that she left the country as the Mueller indictment was announced.", "Source credibility": "The expert mentions that the story originated from a website called Freedum Junkshun, which self-identifies as satirical and unreliable. The disclaimer on the website raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of evidence": "The claim about Hillary Clinton leaving the country during the Mueller indictment announcement is not supported by any evidence. The expert points out that the story provided no evidence to support the claim, making it less credible.", "Inaccurate image": "The picture accompanying the story, which supposedly shows Hillary Clinton leaving from Reagan National Airport, is actually from 2013 and was taken in Little Rock, Arkansas. This discrepancy further undermines the claim's authenticity."}
