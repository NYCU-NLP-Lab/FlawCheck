{"The claim made by U": "S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse that \"Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s\" is being examined for authenticity.", "The 2008 article written by researchers at the University of Rhode Island": "s Graduate School of Oceanography and published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science is cited as evidence supporting the claim. It states that the surface water of the Bay from December through February has warmed on average by about 2.2 degrees Celsius since 1960, which is equivalent to 4 degrees Fahrenheit.", "Jeremy Collie": "a URI oceanographer, confirms the presence of a warming signal in the data from 1959 through 2010. He notes that the winter months show a warming rate of about 0.5 degrees F. per decade, amounting to approximately 2.5 degrees F. since 1960. However, he mentions that there can be normal variation in the readings from winter to winter.", "The data collected off Fox Island": "located between North Kingstown and the Jamestown Bridge, supports the claim. The trend analysis using Microsoft Excel shows an increase of 2.4 degrees for December-February from 1959-2010, with a slight variation if the winter of 1959-60 is excluded."}
