{"The claim is based on a post shared on Facebook that shows an image of Trump next to two individuals wearing Ku Klux Klan garb": "The post carries a headline stating that the KKK endorses Trump's re-election.", "The post is from an article on a website called NPC Daily": "which is known for publishing only satire. The website's bio box includes a disclaimer stating that the entire site is satire.", "The image of Trump with hooded klansmen is actually from artist Alison Jackson": "who uses celebrity lookalikes for her work. It is not a genuine photograph depicting an endorsement from the KKK.", "While Trump was infamously endorsed by former KKK leader David Duke in 2016": "there is no evidence to suggest that the KKK has issued an official endorsement of Trump for his re-election in 2020. The Southern Poverty Law Center states that the KKK has become less visible and more fractured in recent years compared to other white supremacist movements."}
