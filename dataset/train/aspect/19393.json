{"The time frame of the claim": "The expert verified that the claim was made for the period between January 2009 and March 2012. This aspect was confirmed by checking the unemployment data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Comparison of unemployment rates": "The expert examined the unemployment rates for Hispanic or Latino workers in January 2009 and March 2012. The rates were found to be 10.0% and 10.3% respectively, supporting the claim.", "Alternative starting point": "The expert considered the possibility of starting the analysis from February 2009, the first full month of President Obama's tenure. This alternative starting point revealed a different picture, with the Hispanic unemployment rate falling by eight-tenths of a percentage point by March 2012 instead of rising three-tenths of a percentage point.", "Contextual factors": "The expert also took into account the impact of the recession and the specific industry (construction) on Hispanic unemployment rates. The analysis highlighted that job prospects for Hispanics were already declining before Obama took office, and the construction industry, which had a significant Hispanic workforce, was hit hard during the recession. These contextual factors provided a broader understanding of the claim's accuracy."}
