{"The claim wrongly attributed a quote defending President Donald Trump to Clint Eastwood": "2. The actual author of the quote was Fred Doucette, a New Hampshire state Representative and chair of Trump's campaign in that state.", "The quote in question was originally published by Doucette as a letter to the Eagle": "Tribune, a local news outlet covering parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.", "The confusion linking Eastwood to the quote likely arose from a Facebook post by the Massachusetts Republican Party that included a meme quoting Eastwood": "but there is no evidence that Eastwood ever made the specific statement about Congress mentioned in the post."}
