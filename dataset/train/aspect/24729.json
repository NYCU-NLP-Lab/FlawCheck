{"President Donald Trump made the claim that the coronavirus": "is going to go away without a vaccine\" without providing any evidence to support his statement.", "Marc Lipsitch": "an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, stated that it is completely fanciful and not evidence-based to believe that the virus will go away without a vaccine. He emphasized that there is no basis for this claim.", "Lipsitch also mentioned that while it is theoretically possible for the virus to go away permanently with a large uncontrolled epidemic leading to depletion of susceptible individuals and permanent immunity": "this scenario is exceedingly unlikely. No human coronavirus is known to elicit permanent immunity, and countries will continue to have a pool of susceptible individuals, allowing for the reintroduction of the virus.", "Barry Bloom": "an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard, also expressed his skepticism about the virus going away without a vaccine, further reinforcing the lack of evidence for this claim."}
