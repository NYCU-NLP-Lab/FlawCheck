{"The claim was fact": "checked by PolitiFact, an organization known for its commitment to publishing the truth and providing accurate information to the public.", "The claim was traced back to a tweet by John Robitaille": "a 2010 Republican candidate for governor in Rhode Island, who cited a statistic he saw on the website of the late Andrew Breitbart, a conservative blogger and commentator.", "The Breitbart blog": "quoting an analysis done by Examiner.com, claimed that in 2010, 17 states that had elected Republican governors had seen a drop in their unemployment rate since January 2011. However, it also acknowledged that the unemployment rate had dropped in seven out of eight other states that elected Democratic governors.", "Experts": "such as economist Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution, were consulted to provide insights on the claim. They highlighted that attributing changes in unemployment rates solely to the party affiliation of the governor is a stretch, as various factors and events outside the governor's control influence the state economy."}
