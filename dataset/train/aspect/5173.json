{"Comparison of tax rates": "The expert analyzes the claim by examining the historical tax rates under President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush. They provide information on the specific tax rates implemented by each president and how they differed.", "Examination of job growth": "The expert investigates the job growth during the periods when the tax rates were raised and lowered. They reference data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to support their analysis. The expert acknowledges that job rates soared after Clinton's tax increase and argues that jobs didn't grow as quickly after the Bush tax cuts were enacted.", "Opinions of economists": "The expert includes opinions from economists with different perspectives, such as Dan Mitchell from the libertarian Cato Institute, Dean Baker from the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, and J.D. Foster from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. These economists provide their insights on the relationship between tax rates and job growth, offering varying viewpoints on the claim.", "Overall assessment": "The expert concludes that while there is evidence of job growth during the period when Clinton raised taxes, it is not clear if the tax increases directly caused the growth. They emphasize that other economic factors played a larger role in job growth. The expert rates the claim as \"Half True\" based on their analysis and the opinions of the economists consulted."}
