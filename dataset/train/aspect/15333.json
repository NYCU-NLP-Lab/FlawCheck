{"The image was digitally manipulated to add the words": "killing all\" to the original sign, which read \"Ending White Supremacy Starts with White People.\" This manipulation was confirmed by comparing the original photograph to the doctored image.", "The original photograph has been online since August 2017 and was most likely taken at a counter": "protest to the \"Unite The Right Rally\" in Charlottesville, Virginia. The protester in the image was urging white people to do their part in ending racism, similar to other protest signs seen at the rally.", "Social media users": "particularly those arguing against liberalism, spread the doctored image during the Fall of 2018. They used it to support their claims that liberalism is a mental disorder and that liberals want to kill their own race.", "The idea of a": "white genocide\" or \"large scale killing\" of white farmers in South Africa, which some conspiracy theorists and alt-right communities have promoted, was also mentioned in relation to the doctored image. This idea gained some mainstream attention, including being discussed on Fox News and even tweeted about by President Trump. However, it was not directly related to the authenticity of the claim about the protest sign."}
