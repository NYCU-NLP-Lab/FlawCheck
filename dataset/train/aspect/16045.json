{"The claim was initially shared by BJP media panellist Yashveer Raghav on social media": "alleging that the dress code for women attendees of the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (2019) was 'Hijab or Burqa'. This was the first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Prashant Patel Umarao": "known for spreading misinformation, also circulated the claim on Twitter and Facebook, further spreading the notion that the protest had a dress code of hijab and burqa. This was another aspect used to assess the veracity of the claim.", "A keyword search on Twitter led to the original poster shared by Amir Edresy": "who identified himself as the 'Founder President, Association of Muslim Professionals'. The poster mentioned a women's protest against CAA, NRC, and NPR, but there was no mention of any dress code. This provided evidence contradicting the claim.", "Alt News contacted Aamir Edresy from Mumbai Citizens Forum": "who confirmed that there was no dress code for the protest and that the claim was mischievous. This statement from the organizer of the protest served as the final aspect to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
