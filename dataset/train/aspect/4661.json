{"The claim states that the economy has grown at less than 2 percent on average every single year for the last 10 years": "The expert verifies this aspect by referring to government statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which show that the average growth from 2007 to 2016 was 1.37 percent.", "The claim asserts that such a decade of low growth has not been seen in a century in America": "The expert challenges this aspect by pointing out that the Bureau of Economic Analysis data only goes back to 1930, which is less than 100 years ago. Therefore, the claim's assertion cannot be proven with the available data.", "The claim defines a decade as a 10": "year period working backward from 2007. The expert questions this aspect by explaining that while a decade does mean 10 years, it is often defined in historical context as a 10-year period beginning in years that end in zero. For example, the first decade of this century (2000-2009) had an average annual growth rate of 1.82 percent, which contradicts the claim's argument.", "The claim suggests that tax reform holds the key to boosting the economy": "The expert mentions that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senator James Lankford support this idea, but many economists believe it is unlikely to lead to steady yearly growth of 3 percent or more. This aspect highlights the differing perspectives on the effectiveness of tax reform in stimulating economic growth."}
