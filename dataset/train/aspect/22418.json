{"Multiple sources have reported Phoenix": "Arizona as the \"No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world.\" The claim has been made by at least 20 news organizations, including the Associated Press, The Arizona Republic, and United Press International. This suggests that the claim has been widely accepted and reported.", "The claim was initially reported by ABC News on February 11": "2009. The report stated that Phoenix had become the kidnapping capital of America, with over 370 cases in the previous year. While some media outlets referred to Phoenix as \"known as\" the No. 2 kidnapping capital, the Los Angeles Times specifically mentioned that Phoenix police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports in 2008.", "The specific methodology or criteria used to determine the ranking of kidnapping cases in Phoenix and other cities is not mentioned in any of the reports": "None of the sources provide information on how the kidnapping ranking was reached or how many kidnappings were reported in other cities. This lack of transparency raises questions about the validity and accuracy of the claim.", "The FBI and the U": "S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, both authoritative sources on crime statistics, were unable to confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. LaTonya Miller, an Interpol spokeswoman, stated that the agency does not track local kidnapping rates. This suggests that there is no official data or evidence to support the claim."}
