{"The photographs were from a different hurricane": "The expert's verdict highlights that the photographs used to support the claim were actually from Hurricane Ike, which occurred ten years earlier. This discrepancy in the timing of the photographs undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Archived information and clips": "The expert mentions that websites with archived information and clips from a September 2008 edition of \"Anderson Cooper 360\" confirm that the photographs were taken during Hurricane Ike. These archived sources provide further evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Depth of the floodwaters": "The expert explains that in the broadcast, Anderson Cooper mentioned that taking two steps backwards from where he was standing would have caused him to sink in neck-deep water. This information verifies that the floodwaters were indeed deep, supporting the authenticity of Cooper's report.", "Cooper": "s intentions and limitations: The expert notes that although Cooper could have chosen to report from a drier spot, he deliberately chose a location that provided a visually dramatic appearance. However, Cooper's positioning was not meant to misrepresent the general state of the flood. Instead, it was a conscious decision made to avoid interfering with emergency vehicles and others navigating the flooded roads. This aspect clarifies Cooper's intentions and reinforces the authenticity of his report."}
