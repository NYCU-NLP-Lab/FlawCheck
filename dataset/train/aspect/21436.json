{"The expert refers to a Congressional Budget Office": "CBO) report published on February 8, 2021, which estimates that a $15 minimum wage would reduce employment in 2025 by 1.4 million workers. This report provides an official analysis of the potential job losses associated with the proposed minimum wage increase.", "The expert mentions that the CBO report also states that there is a": "significant possibility of large reductions in employment.\" This indicates that there is a chance that the job losses could be higher than the average estimate of 1.4 million workers.", "The CBO report presents a range of potential outcomes": "stating that there is a 33% chance that between zero and 1 million jobs would be lost, and a 33% chance that the decrease would be between 1 million and 2.7 million jobs. This range of estimates provides a comprehensive view of the potential impact on employment.", "The expert highlights that Senator Rand Paul": "s claim of \"almost 4 million people\" losing their jobs if a $15 minimum wage is mandated refers to the high end of the CBO's range of potential outcomes. This clarifies the context of the claim and provides a comparison to the actual estimates provided by the CBO."}
