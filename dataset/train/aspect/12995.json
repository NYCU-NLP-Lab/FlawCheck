{"Former President Barack Obama did not grant clemency to": "18,000 people\" as Joe Biden claimed. The actual number of individuals who received clemency during the Obama administration was about 1,900.", "Delaware": "s Black population is not the \"eighth largest\" as Biden suggested. As of 2019, Delaware's total estimated Black population ranked 33rd among all 50 states and Washington, D.C.", "Biden misspoke during the town hall event and his campaign confirmed that he meant to say something else in both cases": "4.
