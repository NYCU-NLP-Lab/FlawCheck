{"The claim is taken out of context": "The expert's verdict highlights that the quote used in the attack ad was taken out of context. The passage was actually about a key African American election victory, not about Joe Biden ignoring the needs of black people.", "Source of the quote": "The expert's verdict mentions that the quote was taken from Obama's book \"Dreams of my Father.\" By identifying the original source, the authenticity of the claim can be verified.", "Previous use of the quote": "The expert's verdict states that the same quote was used by a pro-Trump PAC in November to attack Democrats in general. This information helps to establish a pattern of the quote being recycled for political purposes, raising questions about its authenticity.", "Voice and perspective in the ad": "The expert's verdict notes that the voice in the ad sounds like Obama dramatizing someone else's words. It clarifies that the words were not Obama's own views but a conversation he recounted from his book. This aspect helps to differentiate between Obama's personal beliefs and the context in which the quote was used."}
