{"The bill sponsored by Earl Blumenauer": "H.R. 3311, does not mandate GPS tracking devices on all vehicles, but rather proposes a national pilot program to test alternative ways of taxing road use.", "The bill would cost the government a little over": "154 million, not \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" as claimed by Delia Lopez.", "The purpose of the bill is to address the challenge of funding road maintenance in the future when gas taxes may decrease due to the prevalence of hybrid and electric cars": "rather than to track individuals' vehicular movements.", "While GPS technology could potentially be used in some of the programs that may be developed as part of the pilot program": "the bill does not specifically mandate the use of GPS tracking devices on all vehicles."}
