{"Repayment of loans": "The expert's verdict mentions that AIG claimed to have fully repaid the federal government, including the loans it received during the bailout.", "Profit of over": "22 billion: AIG also claimed to have made a profit of more than $22 billion, indicating that the company not only repaid the loans but also generated additional earnings.", "Stock sale": "The expert's verdict mentions that the federal government gradually sold its stake in AIG over time, ultimately selling the last shares and making an overall positive return of $22.7 billion.", "Tax breaks and special exemptions": "Critics of the bailout argue that the amount repaid by AIG does not take into account the tax breaks and special exemptions the company received as part of the deal.
