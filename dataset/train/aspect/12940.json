{"The quote attributed to Nike stating": "We\u2019re a $76 Billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 customers\" is not a statement from the company. Nike spokesperson Sandra Carreon-John confirmed that the quote did not come from anyone at Nike.", "Nike has not endorsed a presidential candidate or political party": "While the company has voiced support for Black Lives Matter, it has not made any political endorsements.", "The value of Nike as a company is misstated in the claim": "The claim states that Nike is a $76 billion dollar company, but in reality, Nike is valued at over $180 billion according to Nasdaq.", "The false claim about Nike": "s stance on 'Make America Great Again' customers actually dates back to September 2018, when Nike selected Colin Kaepernick as one of the faces of its anniversary campaign. The claim misrepresents a tweet reacting to the news as a statement from Nike, when in fact, the tweet was not from Nike and the segment on NPR did not contain the quoted statement."}
