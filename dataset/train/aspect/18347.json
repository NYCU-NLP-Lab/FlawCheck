{"The claim was attributed to Sandra Day O": "Connor: The expert's verdict states that the claim was made in a Facebook post that purported to be a quote from Sandra Day O'Connor, the former Supreme Court justice. This attribution is an important aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Poor punctuation led to misinterpretation": "The expert's verdict explains that the misunderstanding of the claim began with the coverage of an interview that Sandra Day O'Connor gave on February 18, 2016. The judge's actual statement was about the nomination process for the next Supreme Court justice, but poor punctuation in the Facebook post led to the misinterpretation of her words.", "The quote was partially taken from an MSNBC article": "The expert's verdict highlights that the first sentence of the Facebook post, which was mistaken as a direct quote from Sandra Day O'Connor, was actually part of a quote pulled from an MSNBC article. This indicates that the claim was a misrepresentation of O'Connor's actual statement.", "The rest of the post was a personal opinion": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the remaining content of the Facebook post, which included the derogatory language towards Republicans, was the opinion of a random person and had little to do with Sandra Day O'Connor. This distinction further supports the conclusion that the claim was not authentic."}
