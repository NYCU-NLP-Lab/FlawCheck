{"The claim made by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid that Zika": "causes people to go blind\" was found to be false by experts. No adults have gone blind because of the virus, although temporary vision impairment is a symptom of Zika.", "One study cited by Reid": "s office did not claim that Zika causes blindness. Instead, it found that the virus infects specific target cells in different regions of the eye. Some infected mice in the study experienced inflammation, but none went blind.", "However": "studies have shown that severe vision impairment is a Zika-related birth defect, indicating that Zika can have serious effects on vision in newborns.", "The World Health Organization declared the Zika outbreak a global public health emergency in February 2016": "and the first locally acquired infections in the U.S. were reported in Puerto Rico in December 2015 and in Florida in July 2016. Zika primarily spreads through the bite of infected Aedes species mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and through sex and blood transfusions. The CDC is currently investigating whether Zika can also spread through bodily fluids like saliva, vomit, or urine."}
