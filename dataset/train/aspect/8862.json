{"The claim is based on two TV ads from Aftab Pureval": "the Democratic challenger, which explicitly state that Steve Chabot, the Republican incumbent, voted to strip mandatory health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions.", "The ads feature a mother": "Colleen Bowman, and her daughter, Ella Bowman, who had cancer at a young age. Colleen Bowman accuses Chabot of punishing her daughter for surviving cancer by voting against pre-existing condition protections.", "Chabot responds with his own ad": "claiming that Pureval is lying about his healthcare record. This suggests that there is a dispute between the two candidates regarding the accuracy of the claim.", "To fully understand the claim": "it is necessary to consider the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which required most Americans to have health insurance and prohibited charging higher premiums based on health status or prior medical conditions. The ACA was disliked by Republicans, including Chabot, who argued that it was economically unsustainable and led to increased premiums for some families."}
