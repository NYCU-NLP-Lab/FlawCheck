{"Testimony from Secret Service and military personnel": "The claim suggests that Secret Service and military personnel have used the designation \"Broomstick One\" for aircraft carrying Hillary Clinton. To verify this, the expert's verdict mentions that conservative radio pundit Rush Limbaugh claimed that the name was given by Secret Service and State Department agents. However, no specific sources or testimonies from these personnel are provided.", "Editorial from The Washington Times": "The expert's verdict mentions that The Washington Times ran an editorial stating that Hillary Clinton was verbally abusive to the pilots of Marine One, the presidential helicopter, and that they called it \"Broomstick One.\" While this editorial supports the claim, it is still an opinion piece and not a direct testimony or verification from personnel involved.", "Anecdotal evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there have been longstanding claims of Hillary Clinton being vulgar and verbally abusive with subordinates. However, most of these claims, which allegedly took place during her time in the White House, have been anecdotal and impossible to confirm. This suggests that there is no concrete evidence or testimony to support the claim.", "Forwarded email": "The expert's verdict mentions that a forwarded email circulated in 2003, claiming that military personnel used \"Broomstick One\" as the call sign for Hillary Clinton's Blackhawk helicopter during her tour in Iraq. However, this is not a reliable source of information and lacks credibility."}
