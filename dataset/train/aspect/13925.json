{"The claim made by Barack Obama was that the last six polls": "including Time magazine, showed that he beat John McCain by six or seven points.", "The expert": "s investigation found that at the time of Obama's speech, several polls did show him beating McCain by a six-point or more margin. The Time magazine poll showed him winning by seven points, the Associated Press/Ipsos poll showed him winning by six points, and the CNN poll showed him winning by eight points.", "However": "the expert's investigation also found that only three polls were cited by Obama, not six as claimed. The expert checked RealClearPolitics.com for a summary of recent Obama-McCain polling and couldn't find three other recent polls showing similar results.", "The expert acknowledged that it": "s possible Obama had access to private polls not seen by the public, but deducts a small amount on the Truth-O-Meter for citing \"the last six polls\" when only three were mentioned. Nonetheless, the expert concludes that Obama's larger point is correct, as polls did show him winning against McCain while Clinton either lost or won by a smaller margin. The statement is awarded a Mostly True rating."}
