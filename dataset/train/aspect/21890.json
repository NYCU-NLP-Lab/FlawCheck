{"The Pew Research Center": "s estimate: The expert refers to the Pew Research Center's estimate that in 2017, there were approximately 3.45 million Muslims living in the U.S., constituting about 1.1% of the total population. This statistic provides a factual basis to counter the claim that the Muslim population will be large enough to elect the President by 2040.", "Projection for 2050": "The expert mentions Pew's projection that by 2050, the U.S. Muslim population is expected to reach 8.1 million, or 2.1% of the total population. This projection demonstrates that even in the longer term, the Muslim population would still not have sufficient numbers to solely determine the outcome of a nationwide election.", "Electoral college system": "The expert explains that even under the United States' electoral college system, a candidate would need the support of at least 23% of voters to win the presidency. This figure is significantly higher than the projected Muslim proportion of the population in 2050, indicating that the claim is not plausible.", "Uneven distribution of Muslims": "The expert highlights that Muslims are not evenly distributed across the U.S., with certain metropolitan areas and states having larger Muslim populations than others. This uneven distribution further undermines the claim that the Muslim population will have enough voters to elect the President by 2040, as their influence would be limited to specific regions rather than being nationwide."}
