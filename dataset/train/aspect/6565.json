{"The source of the claim": "The expert would have examined the source of the claim, which in this case is Mike Keown, a Republican candidate for Congress. They would have verified if Keown made the statement and if it was accurately represented.", "Comparison of average salaries": "The expert would have checked the accuracy of the claim by comparing the average salaries of federal workers and private-sector workers. They would have examined the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to determine if federal workers do, in fact, make more than $100,000 on average while private-sector workers make less than $70,000.", "Inclusion of benefits": "The expert would have considered whether the claim takes into account the total compensation, including benefits, of federal workers and private-sector workers. They would have analyzed the data from USA Today, which reported that federal employees have higher average salaries and benefits than private-sector employees.", "Long": "term trend analysis: The expert would have examined the trend of average compensation for federal employees over time. They would have assessed the accuracy of the claim that average compensation for federal employees has risen 36.9 percent since 2000, adjusted for inflation. They would have also investigated the difference in benefits between federal employees and private-sector workers."}
