{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the absence of any credible evidence to support the claim that Delta Force raided Joe Biden's compound in Ukraine. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with previous disinformation": "The expert points out that the 2021 fake news article is a rehash of a 2017 piece of disinformation that falsely claimed Delta Force had raided Barack Obama's compound in Thailand. By drawing this parallel, the expert exposes the pattern of using similar false narratives to deceive readers.", "Inconsistent details": "The expert identifies several inconsistencies between the 2017 and 2021 fake news articles. These discrepancies include the change in presidents (from Obama to Biden), the date of the raid (from Christmas to New Year's Day), and the location (from Thailand to Ukraine). These inconsistencies raise red flags about the credibility of the claim.", "Misuse of unrelated images": "The expert reveals that both the 2017 and 2021 fake news articles used unrelated images to depict the supposed secret compounds. The images used were actually promotional images from a movie and pictures of unrelated buildings. This deliberate misuse of images further undermines the claim's authenticity."}
