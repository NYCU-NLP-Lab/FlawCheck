{"Hillary Clinton": "s statement: The claim itself is presented as a direct quote from Hillary Clinton, where she states that \"The economy always does better when there\u2019s a Democrat in the White House.\" This is the central claim that is being examined for authenticity.", "Previous fact": "checking rulings: The expert mentions previous fact-checking rulings by PolitiFact, which have found some claims made by Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton regarding the economy to be mostly true or true. This suggests that there is some evidence to support the idea that the economy performs better under Democratic presidents.", "Study by Princeton University economists": "The expert refers to a study conducted by Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. This study concludes that Democratic presidents tend to have more Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth than Republicans, based on historical quarterly GDP data. However, the economists also note that other factors, such as oil prices and international conditions, could influence these better numbers.", "Perspectives from other experts": "The expert includes perspectives from Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel, Washington D.C. economic advisory firm chairman Robert Shapiro, and University of Massachusetts Boston public policy professor Christian Weller. These experts offer different viewpoints on the claim, noting that while there may be some truth to it, the details and comparisons can vary, and the president's control over the economy is limited."}
