{"Trump": "s claim that the United States is responsible for China's rapid economic growth is an oversimplification of the complex economic relationship between the two countries. Experts argue that China's economic liberalization and subsequent prosperity were primarily driven by its own market reforms and opening up to trade with the West in the late 1970s and early 1980s.", "Economists point out that China": "s meteoric growth, with double-digit GDP growth every year from 1979 to 2014, was a result of its own economic reforms and not solely due to any actions taken by the United States. The opening up of China and the introduction of economic reforms by Deng Xiaoping played a significant role in its economic transformation.", "While trade with the United States and other countries has contributed to China": "s economic growth, experts emphasize that it is just one factor among many. Reforms in property rights, taxation, and other areas have been equally if not more fundamental in lifting millions of people out of poverty in China.", "The United States": "efforts at rapprochement with China, including Henry Kissinger's secret visits, Richard Nixon's historic trip, and the lobbying for China's inclusion in the World Trade Organization, may have played a role in fostering closer economic ties between the two countries. However, attributing China's entire economic growth to the actions of the United States is an oversimplification that ignores the broader factors at play."}
