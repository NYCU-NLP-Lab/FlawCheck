{"Lack of evidence": "The Trump administration initially made the claim of an \"imminent\" attack by Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani without providing any evidence to support this assertion. This lack of evidence raised questions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Varying accounts": "The Trump administration offered different accounts of the intelligence assessments that President Trump relied on to make his decision. These varying accounts, without concrete evidence, raised doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Hedging language": "President Trump used hedging language such as \"I believe\" and \"I think\" when discussing the claim. This indicates a level of uncertainty and suggests that the claim may not be based on concrete evidence.", "Contradictory statements": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper contradicted President Trump's claim by stating that he \"didn't see\" any intelligence indicating that the Iranians would attack four embassies. This contradiction further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
