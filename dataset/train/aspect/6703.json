{"The claim is specific and verifiable": "The claim states that Stephen Zappala is \"the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide.\" This makes the claim specific and allows for investigation and verification.", "Historical context": "The expert's verdict mentions that the case referred to in the claim happened in 1995, which was more than a decade before high-profile incidents like Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement. This context provides additional information about the timing and significance of the claim.", "Video evidence and reopening of the case": "The expert's verdict explains that the case was initially not pursued by the previous district attorney but was reopened by Zappala in 1999 after video evidence of the shooting was discovered through a civil case brought by Jackson's family. This aspect highlights the role of video evidence and Zappala's decision to reopen the case.", "Plea deal and legal interpretation": "The expert's verdict mentions that Zappala worked out a plea deal with the officer, resulting in a guilty plea of involuntary manslaughter. Zappala's campaign argues that under Pennsylvania law, this guilty plea is legally considered a conviction of criminal homicide. This aspect involves legal interpretation and the campaign's justification for considering the plea deal as a conviction."}
