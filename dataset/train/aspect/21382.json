{"DACA program eligibility criteria": "The expert's verdict mentions that immigrants with significant criminal backgrounds are not eligible for the DACA program. The program excludes individuals convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanor offenses. This criterion serves as a measure to prevent criminals from being part of the program.", "Immigration attorneys": "caution: The expert's verdict highlights that most immigration attorneys are cautious about allowing individuals with anything but minor criminal offenses to apply for DACA. This caution is due to the risk of immigration enforcement and the potential exposure of personal identity/biometrics information to the government.", "Lack of evidence supporting Trump": "s claim: The expert's verdict mentions that neither the White House nor Trump's re-election campaign provided on-the-record comment to support the claim. Additionally, data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which reviews DACA applications, did not show any evidence indicating a large proportion of DACA recipients with arrest records.", "Absence of data supporting claim": "The expert's verdict states that the data provided by USCIS on terminations and the arrest history of DACA applicants did not support Trump's claim. The absence of data showing a significant number of DACA recipients with criminal records undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
