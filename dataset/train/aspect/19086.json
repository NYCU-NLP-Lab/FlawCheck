{"Lack of personal testimonies": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim is being shared through social media, but there are no instances of anyone sharing the story from a personal point of view. This suggests a lack of firsthand accounts supporting the claim.", "Multiple locations mentioned": "The claim specifically mentions the Northgate Mall, but viral versions of the same post mention various other malls in Canada and the United States. This inconsistency in the location raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "No police reports": "The expert's investigation reveals that the police departments in Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Burnaby have not received any reports or complaints related to the alleged abduction tactics described in the claim. This lack of official reports undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Inability to verify": "Despite the widespread circulation of the claim on social media, the expert's investigation, along with statements from the police departments and mall officials, indicates that there is no evidence or verification to support the existence of sex traffickers using the mentioned tactics. This inability to verify the claim further questions its authenticity."}
