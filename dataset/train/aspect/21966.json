{"Reverse image search": "The experts conducted a reverse image search and found that the image of a cracked egg with a bright pink yolk was a doctored stock photograph, indicating that it was not an authentic representation of a flamingo egg yolk.", "Lack of photographic evidence": "Despite extensive searching, no photographic evidence of a cracked flamingo egg with a bright pink yolk was found. This absence of visual proof raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert consultation": "The experts reached out to flamingo experts at Flamingo Gardens and Flamingo expert Caitlin Kight, who consulted with University of Exeter animal researcher Paul Rose. Both experts confirmed that flamingo egg yolks are not bright pink but can vary in color from bright orange to reddish. This consultation with experts added credibility to the verdict.", "Natural pigmentation process": "The experts explained that flamingos gain their pink coloring through their diet, specifically by ingesting carotenoids from brine shrimp. The enzymes in their liver break down these compounds into pink and orange pigment molecules, which are then deposited into the birds' feathers, legs, and beaks. This natural pigmentation process further supported the conclusion that flamingo egg yolks are not bright pink."}
