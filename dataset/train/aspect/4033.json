{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert points out that there is a lack of credible evidence to support the claim that the personalities of the dwarf characters in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs represent the stages of cocaine addiction. No one who knew or worked with Walt Disney and his animators claimed or suggested that they used recreational drugs.", "Negative evidence": "The expert cites negative evidence by stating that Walt Disney and his animators were well-known figures who did not partake in recreational drugs. The drug of choice during Disney's era was more likely alcohol, as depicted in the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence in Dumbo where the character drinks champagne.", "Timeline inconsistency": "The expert highlights that LSD, which is often associated with drug-inspired art, was not even brought to the USA until 1949, which was too late to have influenced Disney's classic animated films. Alternative hallucinogens such as mescaline were obtainable, but there is no evidence to suggest their use by Disney and his animators.", "Sarcastic remark from an animator": "The expert mentions a sarcastic remark from animator Art Babbitt, who worked on Fantasia, implying that the idea of Disney's imagination being drug-induced is unfounded. This remark adds to the overall lack of support for the claim."}
