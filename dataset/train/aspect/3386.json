{"Lack of evidence for the claim": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Atiku Abubakar has received LGBT support. The claim originated from fake social media accounts and articles quoting anonymous representatives of LGBT organizations that do not have a record of existence or any previous statements or activities.", "Non": "existent LGBT organizations: The expert's verdict highlights that there are no known groups explicitly made up of LGBT people within Nigeria. This is attributed to the widespread arbitrary arrests of LGBT individuals in the country, as reported by human rights groups.", "Fake social media accounts": "The claim initially appeared in a Twitter post from a fake account pretending to be Atiku Abubakar. The unverified account thanked a non-existent organization called the \"Association of Nigerian Gay Men (ANGAM)\" for endorsing his campaign. This highlights the use of fake social media accounts to propagate the claim.", "False statements from alleged representatives": "The expert's verdict mentions that articles in Nigerian newspapers reported a second group called \"Diverse\" officially supporting Atiku Abubakar's campaign. These articles quoted an alleged official named \"Spinky Victor Lee,\" who claimed to be the \"Community President of Nigeria\" for the group. However, there is no evidence of the existence of either \"Spinky Victor Lee\" or the group \"Diverse,\" and no previous statements or activities attributed to them were found. This highlights the use of false statements from alleged representatives to lend credibility to the claim."}
