{"Image verification": "The expert conducted a reverse image search of the images shared on social media and found that they were originally used in an India Express article from January 6, 2015. This confirmed that the images were not recent and were unrelated to the claim being made.", "Source verification": "The expert also verified the source of the images by referring to the official website of the Dawoodi Bohras, which confirmed that the images were from the first death anniversary of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, held in Mumbai on January 6, 2015. This source further supported the fact that the images were not related to Fadnavis visiting a mazaar after the Maharashtra elections.", "Tweet verification": "The expert found a tweet from Devendra Fadnavis himself, dated January 5, 2015, where he mentioned paying tributes to the religious head of the Dawoodi Bohra community on his death anniversary. This tweet provided additional evidence that the images were from a different event in 2015 and not a recent visit to a mazaar.", "Historical context": "The expert also provided information about the Dawoodi Bohras being a sect of Shia Islam and explained that the death anniversary of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was celebrated on January 6, 2015, as per the Islamic Egyptian calendar. This historical context further supported the fact that the images were from a specific event in 2015 and had no connection to the claim being made."}
