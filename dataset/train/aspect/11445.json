{"The claim is based on a description provided by comedian Nicole Byer during an episode of Comedy Central": "s \"Drunk History.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is to consult archival news coverage and speak with historians to gather more information and context about the alleged conflict between Lady Bird Johnson and Eartha Kitt.", "The historical evidence supports the claim that Eartha Kitt attended a": "Women Doer's Luncheon\" at the White House on January 18, 1968, where she spoke out against the Vietnam War. This is verified through a New York Times story from January 19, 1968, which reported on the event and Kitt's criticism of the war.", "Lady Bird Johnson frequently recorded her thoughts and reflections during her husband": "s presidency. A transcript from a January 18, 1968, recording in Lady Bird Johnson's audio diary details the events of the luncheon, including Kitt's critique of the Vietnam War. This provides additional evidence supporting the claim.", "The claim is further corroborated by the fact that other public figures": "such as journalist Walter Cronkite and actress Jane Fonda, also spoke out against the Johnson administration's handling of the Vietnam War. This suggests a broader context of criticism and dissent during that time period, making it more plausible that Lady Bird Johnson might have reacted negatively to Kitt's remarks."}
