{"Historical context": "The expert mentions that the parties of Martin Luther King Jr.'s era are not the same as the parties today. King's father was a Republican, which was not surprising during a time when most Southern Democrats supported segregation.", "Voting patterns": "The expert notes that in recent history, blacks have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. This suggests that King, being a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, may have aligned with the Democratic party.", "Civil Rights Act of 1964": "The expert highlights that the landmark Civil Rights Act was approved based on geography, not party affiliation. It was passed with the support of Republicans and Democrats outside the South, while most Southern Democrats opposed it. This indicates that party affiliation alone may not accurately determine King's political beliefs.", "Expert analysis": "The expert mentions that other fact-checking organizations, such as PolitiFact, have investigated the claim and ruled it as false. This suggests that experts who have extensively researched King's political affiliation do not support the claim that he was a Republican."}
