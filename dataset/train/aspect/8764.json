{"Comparison with Republican debates": "The expert's verdict highlights the comparison between the Democratic and Republican debate schedules in terms of the number of debates and viewership. This aspect helps verify the claim by providing evidence that the Democratic Party did not maximize the opportunity for voters to see their candidates compared to the Republicans.", "Cumulative viewership": "The expert's verdict mentions the cumulative viewership of the Democratic debates, which is approximately 42.5 million. This aspect further supports the claim by indicating that the Democratic Party's debate schedule did not attract as many viewers as the Republicans, suggesting a potential limitation in reaching a larger audience.", "Comparison with previous Democratic debates": "The expert's verdict compares the current Democratic debates with those held in 2008, when Barack Obama won the nomination. It highlights that the current Democratic debates have lower viewership and fewer highly-rated debates compared to the previous cycle. This aspect reinforces the claim that the Democratic Party did not maximize the opportunity for voters to see their candidates in the current debate schedule.", "Accessibility and broadcast network TV": "The expert's verdict mentions that all but one of the Democratic debates are on broadcast network TV, making it more likely for people without cable to tune in. This aspect addresses the claim's assertion that the schedule was designed to maximize the opportunity for voters to see the candidates, suggesting that accessibility through broadcast networks may have been a consideration. However, it does not provide strong evidence to support the claim, as the viewership numbers still indicate a lower reach compared to the Republican debates."}
