{"The address discrepancy": "The expert's investigation revealed that the tech company Premise does not share the same address as Todd & Clare, debunking the claim that they are one and the same. Premise had moved to a different location in San Francisco well before Todd & Clare was recorded at the 7th Street address.", "Premise": "s denial of association: The CEO of Premise, David Soloff, stated that his company has no association, dealings, or knowledge of T&C Network Solutions. This contradicts the claim that Premise is a front for the web site that accused Julian Assange of pedophilia.", "Supporting evidence from WikiLeaks": "WikiLeaks provided a document from their own investigation, which showed that Todd & Clare was first recorded at the 7th Street address in October 2015. This aligns with Premise's statement that they moved out of that building in August 2015, further undermining the claim.", "Lack of substantial ties": "The alleged \"ties\" between Premise CEO David Soloff, Hillary Clinton, and Todd & Clare were based on pictures of Soloff posing with Clinton. However, the expert points out that having a picture taken with someone does not provide substantive proof of any significant connection."}
