{"The ad claims that Joe Biden": "tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades.\" The expert's verdict states that while Biden's record on this issue is mixed, it is misleading to say that he tried to cut these programs for decades.", "The ad suggests that Biden wants to take Social Security and Medicare benefits away from Americans and grant them to illegal immigrants": "The expert's verdict clarifies that this is not Biden's plan and that he actually wants to allow immigrants illegally to buy health insurance without government subsidies, without affecting Americans' ability to buy their own insurance.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that Biden has cast nearly 50 votes to increase Social Security benefits or block Republican plans to curtail benefits throughout his career in Congress. This contradicts the claim made in the ad that Biden has consistently tried to cut these programs."}
