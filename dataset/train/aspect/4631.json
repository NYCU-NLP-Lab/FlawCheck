{"The claim is supported by evidence from reputable sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that O'Rourke's claim aligns with a statement by an NAACP program and an editorial in The Nation, both of which highlight environmental racism and its impact on communities of color and low-income. This suggests that the claim is based on credible information and research.", "Academic research supports the claim": "The expert references studies conducted by Indiana University, Temple University, and the University of Michigan, which have found evidence of racial disparities in the proximity of toxic and polluting facilities. These studies indicate that minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics, are disproportionately burdened by environmental hazards compared to whites.", "Multiple experts in the field agree with the claim": "The expert quotes professors and researchers from various universities who specialize in environmental justice. Their collective expertise strengthens the credibility of the claim, as they provide additional evidence and perspectives on the issue.", "Historical analysis supports the claim": "The expert mentions a study conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan and the University of Montana, which examined the demographic composition of neighborhoods before and after the siting of hazardous waste facilities. This historical analysis suggests a correlation between the racial composition of a neighborhood and the presence of such facilities, further supporting the claim."}
