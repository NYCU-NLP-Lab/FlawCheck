{"The political makeup of Travis County": "specifically Austin, was examined. It was found that at the time of Hannity's statement, Travis County had no countywide elected Republicans and its Texas House delegation consisted of five Democrats and one Republican. Additionally, in the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama carried 60 percent of the county's vote.", "The overall political landscape of Texas was analyzed": "It was noted that no Democrat has won statewide since 1994 and no Democratic presidential nominee has captured the state since 1976. In the 2012 presidential election, Republican Mitt Romney beat Obama by more than 1 million votes, carrying 57 percent of the vote.", "Other regions in Texas were considered to determine if Austin was the only liberal area": "It was found that Obama won several traditionally Democratic areas, including the border region, El Paso County, Bexar County (home to San Antonio), Dallas County, Harris County (home to Houston), and Jefferson County (home to Beaumont). In the 2014 governor election, Democrat Wendy Davis outpolled Republican Greg Abbott only in Travis and Dallas counties.", "Local strengths of Democrats outside of Austin were identified": "In Dallas County, the county's judge and five other countywide officeholders were Democrats. In contrast, neighboring Tarrant County had a different political makeup."}
