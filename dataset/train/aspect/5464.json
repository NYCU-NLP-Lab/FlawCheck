This adds credibility to the claim as it is being attributed to a recognized advocate for stronger gun laws.", "Confirmation by expert analysis": "The expert's verdict states that the claim made by Alyssa Milano is partly accurate. It explains that while licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers are required to conduct background checks for the transfer of all firearms, private sellers in Texas are not obligated to run such checks. This analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the claim's accuracy.", "Legal perspective": "Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, confirms that Texas does not have a state law requiring any seller to perform background checks on purchasers of any gun. This legal perspective further supports the claim's accuracy and provides additional evidence for its verification."}
