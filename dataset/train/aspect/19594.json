{"The claim of": "about 60,000 net new jobs\" made by Governor Bob McDonnell in Virginia since February was verified by checking the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. The governor's press secretary, Stacey Johnson, confirmed that the number came from the BLS.", "The methodology used to calculate the net job gain under McDonnell was examined": "Randy Marcus, the chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell's jobs team, explained that the computation involves subtracting the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February (McDonnell's first full month in office) from the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. This calculation includes both full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors.", "The verification process also involved comparing the governor": "s claim to the actual BLS data. Based on the latest BLS numbers available at the time, it was determined that Virginia had a net job gain of 55,400 under McDonnell, slightly lower than the claimed 60,000 new jobs but still within the ballpark.", "The experts also cross": "referenced the claim with additional statistics to provide context. It was found that the governor's claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs since taking office was consistent with the figures provided in July, where McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created. The decrease in job numbers since then was attributed to factors such as the layoff of federal census workers and the slowdown in construction. Additionally, the governor's statement that only Texas had gained more jobs than Virginia since February was verified using BLS statistics, confirming its accuracy."}
