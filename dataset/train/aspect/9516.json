This clarification helps verify the claim by providing additional context and clarifying any potential misinterpretation of Obama's statement.", "Joe Klein": "s observation: Joe Klein, a journalist from Time magazine, noted that he could not find any instance where Obama specifically mentioned negotiating with Ahmadinejad. Klein's observation supports the claim's authenticity by pointing out that Obama's focus is on negotiating with the Iranian leadership, particularly Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, rather than Ahmadinejad specifically."}
