{"The Better Business Bureau": "BBB) ratings: The expert examined the BBB ratings for Ganley dealerships, which indicated that two of the dealerships had received F ratings. The expert noted that these ratings were primarily due to the dealerships' failure to respond to complaints and false advertising claims. The expert also mentioned that the average grade for the 20 Ganley dealerships was a B+, which compared favorably to other dealer groups surveyed.", "Context of the claims": "The expert highlighted that the claims made by the DCCC's TV ad regarding Ganley's BBB ratings and complaints were presented without context. They noted that Ganley had been in business for four decades and is Ohio's largest car dealer, which should be taken into account when evaluating the significance of the ratings and complaints.", "Factors considered by the BBB": "The expert mentioned that the BBB ratings are based on 17 different factors, including the time a business has been in operation and how it handles complaints. They emphasized that a business's responsiveness to complaints is an important factor considered by the BBB.", "Changes in ratings": "The expert pointed out that the BBB ratings undergo continuing review and revision. They noted that one of the F ratings was upgraded to a B-, the second dealership had its rating changed to \"no rating\" and is under review, and a third dealership, which was not rated earlier, received an F rating. This information suggests that the ratings are subject to updates and may not necessarily reflect the current status of the dealerships."}
