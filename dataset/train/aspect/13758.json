{"The ad": "s claim that Mark Pryor voted \"to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants\" is a repeated and debunked charge that has been fact-checked by multiple sources.", "The ad misrepresents the 2006 vote": "making it sound like Pryor was voting to create a new entitlement for illegal immigrants to qualify for Social Security. In reality, the vote concerned a narrower issue related to the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former illegal immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill.", "During the Senate debate on the broader immigration bill in 2006": "Senator John Ensign offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number, which would have mostly affected illegal aliens. This amendment is what the ad cited.", "Fact": "checkers have previously checked claims about lawmakers voting to give themselves special benefits to purchase Obamacare, including a claim made by Pryor's Republican opponent, Tom Cotton. These claims were found to be false."}
