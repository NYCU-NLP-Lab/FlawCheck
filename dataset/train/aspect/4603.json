{"The expert investigated the source of the claim and found that it was based on a 2015 Welfare Report Card issued by the conservative think tank": "the Heartland Institute. This report evaluated and ranked states' policies under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which is a welfare-to-work reform program.", "The expert discovered that Missouri received the lowest score": "an F) in the Heartland Institute's report, indicating that the state's welfare policies were deemed the worst in the nation. However, the expert noted that the claim made by Catherine Hanaway specifically focused on Missouri's ability to move people from welfare to work, which added complexity to the evaluation.", "The expert analyzed data from the U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services, which tracks the reasons families stop receiving TANF benefits in each state. The data revealed that in Missouri, 81% of families stopped receiving benefits due to employment, which was the highest rate in the country. This contradicted Hanaway's claim that Missouri is the worst state at moving people from welfare to work.", "The expert consulted with Liz Schott": "a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who explained that Missouri's longer lifetime limit and lighter sanctions contributed to fewer cases being closed for reasons other than employment. This suggests that Missouri's success in moving people from welfare to work may be tied to factors that the Heartland Institute considered negative in their evaluation."}
