{"Vulnerability of early RKE systems": "The expert mentions that the earliest remote keyless entry (RKE) systems were susceptible to the type of attack described in the claim. These systems had RF transmitters that sent unique identifying codes, which could be intercepted by \"code grabbers.\"", "Personal experiences of car owners": "The expert shares two personal accounts of individuals who experienced suspicious activities related to their RKE systems. In both cases, the cars were unlocked without the owners' input, indicating a potential breach in the system's security.", "Police confirmation of the scheme": "The expert cites a police officer who confirmed the existence of a device used by thieves to clone security codes when locking car doors with RKE devices. The officer advises manually locking the car door from inside to prevent such thefts.", "Explanation of RKE system functionality": "The expert explains that pressing the lock button on an RKE device when exiting a car does not send the security code. This information supports the claim that thieves armed with \"code grabbers\" can exploit this vulnerability in RKE systems."}
