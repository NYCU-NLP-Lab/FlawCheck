{"Congressional testimony from the Center for Immigration Studies": "The expert found that the claim of 400,000 \"anchor babies\" born in the United States every year was supported by congressional testimony from the Center for Immigration Studies. The organization stated that 350,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal immigrants in the United States annually.", "Outdated figures": "The expert also highlighted that the figures provided by the Center for Immigration Studies may be outdated. According to a senior demographer from the Pew Research Center, current estimates suggest that the number of children born to undocumented immigrants is around 300,000 per year, lower than the figures from the mid-2000s.", "Verification of terminology": "The expert examined the term \"anchor babies\" used in the claim and questioned its accuracy. The metaphor implies intent, suggesting that undocumented mothers specifically come to the United States to give birth for legal status. However, it was noted that there is no substantial evidence to support this claim.", "Lack of response from the Trump campaign": "The expert mentioned that despite attempts to contact Corey Lewandowski and the Trump campaign for clarification on the claim, no response was received. This lack of response raises questions about the campaign's willingness to provide further evidence or substantiate the claim."}
