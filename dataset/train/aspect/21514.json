{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence to support the claim that Putin threatened jail time for people who don't stay at home during the coronavirus pandemic. They stated that there were no credible media reports or information from reliable sources to confirm this.", "Source of the claim": "The claim appears to originate from a post by the Twitter account of an Indian comedian, who later labeled it as a \"joke.\" The expert highlighted that the comedian's tweet was the source of the claim and that it was not a statement made by Putin or the Russian government.", "Social media circulation": "The claim gained traction on social media platforms, with posts circulating about Putin's supposed choice between staying home for 15 days or going to jail for 5 years. The expert mentioned that the post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation.", "Contradictory information": "The expert mentioned that credible media reports and a political scientist specializing in Russia found no evidence of Putin giving Russians such a draconian choice. They also highlighted other measures implemented by Putin, such as closing schools and gathering places, providing financial support to certain groups, and ensuring phone and internet services remain active. This contradictory information further supports the lack of authenticity in the claim."}
