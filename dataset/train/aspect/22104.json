{"Repetition of photographs": "The expert's verdict mentions that Rep. Lauren Boebert has repeatedly posed for photographs with or alongside AR-15 style guns. This repetition of photographs serves as evidence to verify the claim.", "Police affidavit information": "The information contained in a Boulder police affidavit suggests that the suspected assailant in the March 2021 mass shooting owned, carried, and used an AR-15 style weapon or a variant thereof. This information further supports the claim's authenticity.", "Public reaction and media coverage": "The expert's verdict highlights the reaction of the public and media coverage following the shooting. The fact that the popular left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats highlighted Rep. Boebert's association with AR-15 rifles and her support for gun rights adds to the verification of the claim.", "Subjective interpretation": "The expert acknowledges that the description of Boebert \"fetishizing\" guns is subjective but confirms that the meme accurately described her remarks after the shooting and her history of posing with AR-15 style guns. This subjective interpretation, although not definitive, contributes to the overall verification process."}
