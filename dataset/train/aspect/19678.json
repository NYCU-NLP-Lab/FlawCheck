{"The claim was verified by analyzing the source of the information": "which was a fake news website called Viral In India. The expert noted that this website is known for sharing misinformation that targets the BJP, so its credibility was questioned.", "The expert also examined the social media reactions to the claim": "They found that a parody Twitter account of Lalu Prasad Yadav, as well as a Twitter user claiming to be a spokesperson for the Times of Congress, had shared the article with the same narrative. This raised suspicions about the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert further investigated the incident mentioned in the claim and found that it had actually occurred in March 2017": "not in December 2018 as claimed. This information was obtained from a report published by The Quint, which stated that the attack on Amit Shah's convoy with eggs had taken place during the Patidar agitation.", "The expert also analyzed a YouTube video uploaded by VTV Gujarati News": "which showed a screengrab similar to the one attached in the Viral In India report. This further supported the fact that the incident in question had taken place in 2017, not in 2018."}
