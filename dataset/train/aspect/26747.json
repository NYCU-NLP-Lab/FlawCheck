{"The claim is based on a meme that surfaced in December 2016": "which attributed the blame for a $6 billion cut to veteran pensions solely to Senate Democrats.", "The meme fails to mention that the legislation responsible for the cut": "the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, was a result of negotiations between Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray.", "The bill passed in the House with significant support from both Republicans and Democrats": "and it was also approved by the Senate with the unanimous vote of Senate Democrats, along with the support of seven Republicans and independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King.", "Rep": "Paul Ryan defended the bill and the specific cut to cost-of-living adjustments for younger military retirees, arguing that it was a necessary reform that would only affect those retiring before the age of 62, and that it was a more modest reform compared to other bipartisan proposals."}
