{"The claim was made by Rep": "Markwayne Mullin, a Republican congressman from Oklahoma, who stated that under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut.", "The figure of": "1,182 comes from the House Ways and Means Committee, which wrote the tax bill. The committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal's changes could affect different types of taxpayers.", "The key elements in the committee": "s calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction, and the child tax credit. The tax brackets would be consolidated into four, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000, and the child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, with an additional $300 credit for parents and other dependents.", "The example provided by Mullin refers to a": "family of four making $59,000 per year.\" The Ways and Means Committee chose this household income because it is the median household income nationally. According to the committee's calculations, a family in this income range would pay over $1,182 less in taxes compared to the previous year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400."}
