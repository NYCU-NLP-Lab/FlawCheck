{"Back": "of-a-napkin math discrepancy: The expert points out that there is an immediate miscalculation in the claim's assertion that there are 5,600 soldiers committing suicide, which would equate to about 20 a day. The expert highlights that the accurate calculation would result in 15 daily suicides.", "Confirmation from an investigation": "The expert mentions that an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation revealed that more than 500 veterans were on a waiting list for mental health care in 2010, and 16 of them attempted suicide. This investigation supports the claim that there are issues with mental health services for veterans.", "Federal audits linking deaths to poor oversight": "The expert cites federal audits that tied the deaths of three veterans in Atlanta to poor oversight by hospital staff, including those who had been referred to outside facilities. This evidence suggests that there are systemic problems within the Veterans Affairs system that may contribute to veteran suicides.", "VA study on suicide data": "The expert refers to a VA study that states that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. Although this number does not specifically differentiate between soldiers who are on active or reserve duty and all veterans, it provides a broader context for understanding the prevalence of veteran suicides."}
