There is uncertainty regarding whether the image shows the result of an illness, injury, accident, assault, or a form of punishment. Moreover, the offense that might have prompted the punishment remains unknown.", "Longevity and prior context": "The photograph has been online for several years and has been presented in many different contexts before becoming associated with the claim of depicting a woman flogged for holding a can of beer.
