{"The claim is based on a petition conducted in 1998 by Arthur Robinson": "a biochemist and climate change skeptic. The petition, known as Robinson's Petition Project, currently has 31,487 signatories.", "The petition does not mention anything about climate change being a hoax or being perpetuated for profit": "The key sentence in the petition states that there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of greenhouse gases is causing catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.", "The term": "scientist\" used in the claim is vague, as it only requires a bachelor's degree in science. It does not necessarily mean that the signatories have studied a science related to climate change or pursued a career in science. The petition website states that 12,715 signers hold \"BS or equivalent academic degrees.\"", "There is no information provided about the expertise or specialization of the signatories in fields directly related to climate change": "The petition website mentions that there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment, but it is unclear how many of them are signatories of the petition."}
