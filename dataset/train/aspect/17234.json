{"The expert cites a Congress": "mandated report published by the Director of National Intelligence, which provides information on the number of former Guantanamo detainees who have re-engaged in terrorist activity. This report is seen as a reliable source of data to verify the claim.", "The most recent report": "published in September, shows that 17.6 percent of released prisoners have been confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorism, while an additional 12.4 percent are suspected of re-engaging. These figures are used to calculate the 30 percent mentioned in the claim.", "The expert references a Washington Post article from June 2016": "which is cited as the source for both portions of the claim. While the article is not directly quoted, it is implied that it provides information supporting the claim's accuracy.", "The expert acknowledges that the claim may be slightly exaggerated": "as not all prisoners who re-engaged in terrorism can be definitively linked to Guantanamo Bay. However, there is evidence that some released prisoners have been involved in acts of terrorism, suggesting that the claim has some basis in reality."}
