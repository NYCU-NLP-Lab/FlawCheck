{"The comparison of two images": "The expert analyzed the claim by examining two images side by side. One image showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi garlanding a bust of Mahatma Gandhi, while the other image claimed to show Modi garlanding a bust of Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Gandhi. This visual comparison was crucial in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Investigation of the Facebook page": "The expert investigated the source of the claim, which was a Facebook page called Feku Express 2.0. They examined the credibility of the page, including its number of followers and the history of its posts. This analysis helped in assessing the reliability of the claim.", "Search for supporting evidence": "The expert conducted a Google Reverse Image search to find any other instances of the photograph showing Modi garlanding the alleged Godse bust. They discovered an article from the International Business Times, which stated that the photograph was actually of Modi paying tribute to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, not Godse. This evidence contradicted the claim and added weight to the verdict.", "Contextual information": "The expert provided additional context regarding the controversy surrounding Nathuram Godse and his association with the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh). They explained that while Godse has been a divisive figure, the RSS has distanced itself from him. This information helped in understanding the political implications and motivations behind the claim."}
