{"Anonymous sources": "The claim relies on information from anonymous sources, including a Mexican Army officer and a Mexican Federal Police inspector. This raises concerns about the credibility and verifiability of the information provided.", "Lack of independent corroboration": "PolitiFact found no independent corroboration of the claim that ISIS is present in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez or operating a camp near the Texas border. This lack of independent verification casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements from official sources": "The claim contradicts statements from official sources such as the Homeland Security Department and the National Security Council. Both agencies have stated that there is no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border or that the claim has any validity.", "Reluctance to disclose key sources": "The director of investigations and research at Judicial Watch, the organization behind the claim, stated that the key sources were not authorized to speak on the record and identifying them would put their lives at risk. This lack of transparency raises questions about the reliability of the sources and the information they provided."}
