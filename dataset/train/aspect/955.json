{"Multiple sources shared the video": "The video of rainwater gushing inside a bus in Delhi was shared by various sources, including Punjab Congress, Congress national media panellist Abhishek Dutt, Congress leader Alka Lamba, Delhi Youth Congress, Republic Bharat anchor Ashutosh Chaturvedi, and a Twitter user @Being_Habibi. This widespread sharing of the video indicates that it gained attention and was considered authentic by these sources.", "Claims linking the video to Delhi": "The video was shared with captions and tweets specifically mentioning Delhi and criticizing the Delhi government, such as Punjab Congress writing, \"Kejriwal's Delhi model,\" and Delhi Youth Congress stating, \"Arvind Kejriwal ji, your development starts sinking as soon as the rain comes.\" These claims suggest that the video was presented as evidence of a problem in Delhi, adding to its perceived authenticity.", "Media reports linking the incident to Jaipur": "A reverse image search of a frame from the video led to media reports stating that the incident actually took place in Jaipur, Rajasthan. A report in Patrika and a tweet by an NDTV journalist mentioned Jaipur as the location of the incident. These reports provide conflicting information about the authenticity of the claim, raising doubts about its connection to Delhi.", "Visual clues within the video": "Certain visual cues within the video itself, such as the words \"Jaipur Bus\" written on the side of the vehicle at 58 seconds and a board of \"\u0928\u0938\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u091f\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0930\u0915\u091c\u0940\" (Nasiyan Bhattarak Ji), a Jain temple in Jaipur, at 54 seconds, suggest that the incident indeed took place in Jaipur rather than Delhi. These visual clues provide additional evidence contradicting the claim's authenticity."}
