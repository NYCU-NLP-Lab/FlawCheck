{"The ad strongly implies that John Hickenlooper accepted donations in exchange for not penalizing an oil and gas company involved in a fatal home explosion in 2017": "but there is no proof of this quid pro quo relationship.", "Anadarko Petroleum Corp": "the company that owned the well and pipeline involved in the explosion, did donate over $330,000 to Hickenlooper's administration, but a Denver news station's report found no evidence of a quid pro quo.", "The state agency responsible for imposing fines waited for a federal report on the explosion before imposing a record fine against the company in March 2020": "which was more than two years after the incident and 10 months after Hickenlooper was no longer governor.", "The state attorney general": "not the governor, is responsible for prosecutions, so the claim that Hickenlooper \"let them get away with it\" is misleading."}
