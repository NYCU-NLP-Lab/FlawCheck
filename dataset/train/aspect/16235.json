{"The claim was verified by checking the original source": "which in this case was a statement made by Ruben Navarrette Jr. in his opinion column. The expert examined the column and confirmed that the claim was indeed made by Navarrette.", "The expert also verified the claim by researching the Pew Hispanic Center": "the organization mentioned by Navarrette as the source of the statistic. The expert found evidence of a news article quoting Mark Hugo Lopez, the associate director of the center, stating a similar figure of 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turning 18 and becoming eligible to vote each month.", "To further confirm the claim": "the expert analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. By dividing the number of U.S.-born Hispanics recorded as turning 18 in 2009, the expert was able to calculate an average of nearly 55,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turning 18 each month.", "The expert compared the statistic for U": "S.-born Hispanics to the numbers for other population groups, such as U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites and U.S.-born non-Hispanic blacks. This comparison provided additional context and showed that while the figure for U.S.-born Hispanics was significant, there were other groups with higher numbers of individuals turning 18 each month."}
