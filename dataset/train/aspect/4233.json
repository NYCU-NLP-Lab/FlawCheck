{"The photo used in the misleading Facebook post was published on the U": "S. National Archives website, with a caption stating that it was taken in 2003 during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. This verifies that the photo is not recent and does not depict a US military helicopter shot down over the Iraqi-Syrian border in 2020.", "A reverse image search on Google followed by a keyword search revealed that the same photo was also published in a Foreign Policy magazine article in April 2015": "The caption in the magazine article matches the one listed by the U.S. National Archives, further confirming the photo's authenticity and its unrelated context to the claimed incident.", "The US Department of Defense confirmed that there were no casualties in the Iranian missile strikes on January 8": "2020. US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper explicitly stated that there were no friendly casualties, including US military personnel, coalition forces, or contractors. This contradicts the claim of four Americans and a pilot being killed in the helicopter attack.", "A report from the US State Department on January 8": "2020, also confirmed that there were no military casualties for the US or its allies in Iraq. This further supports the conclusion that the claim of a US military helicopter being shot down over the Iraqi-Syrian border in 2020 is false."}
