{"The lack of evidence of a mass grave": "The Woodland Cultural Centre, which manages the former Mohawk Institute building, confirmed that no mass grave was ever discovered on the school grounds despite extensive archaeological searches. They stated that over 1,000 test pits were dug and no human remains or mass burials were found.", "Testimony from a local reporter": "Jim Windle, a veteran reporter for the Two Row Times, conducted his own investigation and found no basis or confirmation for the claim of a mass shooting at the Mohawk Institute. He searched through old newspapers and spoke with former students of the school, but could not find any evidence supporting the claim.", "Inaccurate photo and location": "The photo used to illustrate the claim was not taken in 1943 at the Mohawk Institute in Ontario. It was actually a photo of indigenous children at a residential school in Cranbrook, British Columbia, taken in 1925. This discrepancy raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Historical context of residential schools": "The expert provides information about the purpose and establishment of residential schools in Canada. These schools were intended to impose a Christian and Western lifestyle on indigenous children and were often run by the church. The expert mentions that an estimated 150,000 indigenous children attended these schools between 1831 and 1996, providing a broader context for understanding the claim."}
