{"The claim was made by President Barack Obama in a speech on the economy in Galesburg": "Ill.", "The White House provided supporting evidence for the claim": "pointing to a study published in late 2011 by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which is a nonpartisan budget-analysis arm of Congress.", "The CBO study analyzed income trends between 1979 and 2007 for various income levels": "including the top 1 percent. It found that the top 1 percent's inflation-adjusted, after-tax income rose by a cumulative 275 percent, which is not quite quadrupling but still qualifies as \"nearly quadrupled.\"", "The CBO study also found that for the 60 percent of the population in the middle of the income scale": "the cumulative growth in inflation-adjusted, after-tax household income was just under 40 percent, averaging to just 1.4 percent per year. This supports Obama's claim that the \"typical family's incomes barely budged\" compared to the significant income growth of the top 1 percent."}
