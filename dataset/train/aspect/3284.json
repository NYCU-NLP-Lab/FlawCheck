{"The study was commissioned by a movie rental service": "The fact that the study was commissioned by a movie rental service raises questions about the potential bias and motive behind the research. It suggests that the study may have been conducted to promote the rental service's horror movie offerings rather than to provide unbiased scientific evidence.", "Lack of peer review and publication": "The study was not peer-reviewed or published, which is a crucial aspect in scientific research. Peer review ensures that the study's methodology, data, and conclusions are rigorously evaluated by independent experts in the field. The absence of peer review raises concerns about the reliability and validity of the study's findings.", "No follow": "up studies replicating the findings: The expert's verdict mentions that there were no follow-up studies conducted to replicate the findings of the initial study. Replication is a fundamental aspect of scientific research as it helps confirm the reliability and generalizability of the results. The absence of replication studies weakens the credibility of the claim.", "Timing and motive of the study": "The study was publicized just before Halloween, suggesting that it may have been strategically released to boost video sales during the holiday season. This raises doubts about the true intent and scientific rigor of the study. The motive behind the research being commercial rather than scientific undermines the claim's authenticity."}
