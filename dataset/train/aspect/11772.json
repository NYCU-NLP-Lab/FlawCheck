{"The claim is based on a 2007 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology that analyzed the ability of": "medicinal smoke\" to cleanse a room of certain airborne bacteria.", "The study did not include sage in its ingredient list": "but rather used a mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs called havan samagri, which is used in Vedic Hindu tradition.", "Burning havan samagri for one hour was shown to kill more than 94": "of airborne bacteria in a closed room, and the effects were not short-lived, suggesting that medicinal smoke had the ability to \"purify\" or \"disinfect\" the air for up to 24 hours.", "However": "there is inconclusive evidence to suggest that burning sage, or \"smudging,\" is capable of purifying the air in confined spaces, and there is no evidence that burning sage kills bacteria or viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19."}
