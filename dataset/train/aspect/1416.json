This verifies that Paul does have wealthy backers supporting his campaign.", "Difficulty in determining who is a billionaire": "The expert highlighted the challenge in determining who is a billionaire versus a super-rich millionaire, as there is no easy way to differentiate. This is important because McCaskill's claim specifically mentioned a \"billionaire\" backing.", "Existence of other wealthy backers for Rand Paul": "The expert mentioned Scott Banister, a self-described capitalist and board member of multiple companies, and his wife Cyan, who have served as angel investors for nearly 100 companies, including Zappos. This demonstrates that Paul has multiple wealthy supporters.", "Total amount raised for Rand Paul": "s super PACs: The expert stated that a total of $5 million has been raised for the two super PACs supporting Rand Paul.
