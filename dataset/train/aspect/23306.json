{"Report by Democrats on the Finance Committee": "The expert mentions that Senator Jeff Merkley cites a report by Democrats on the Finance Committee that finds production costs roughly the same from year to year. This report likely includes data and analysis on the production costs of oil, which can provide evidence to verify the claim.", "Testimony by ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson": "The expert mentions that Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, testified to the Senate Finance Committee and seemed to corroborate Merkley's suggestion that the production cost of oil has been stable. Tillerson estimated the cost at $60 to $70 a barrel, which can be considered as evidence supporting the claim.", "Analysis of production costs": "The expert mentions that the ultimate price of oil is derived from a complicated synthesis of fixed costs, financial markets, geopolitical developments, and global economics. This suggests that an analysis of production costs, including fixed costs such as transportation and refining, can be employed to verify the claim.", "Expert opinion from the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute": "The expert mentions that John Felmy, the chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, argues that Merkley is \"flat out wrong\" and that production costs fluctuate based on various factors. While this may not directly verify the claim, it provides an alternative perspective that can be considered in evaluating the authenticity of the claim."}
