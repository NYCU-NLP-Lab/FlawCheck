{"The claim made by Terry McAuliffe is that women still earn about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for working the same job": "2. McAuliffe's statement mischaracterizes the actual figure on the gender wage gap released by the U.S. Census Bureau, which compares the median pay of all full-time, year-round male and female workers, regardless of occupation.", "The pay gap between men and women can be partly attributed to the fact that jobs typically done by women have lower earnings than jobs typically done by men": "4. Economists generally attribute about 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination, while the remaining 60 percent is explained by differences between workers or their jobs."}
