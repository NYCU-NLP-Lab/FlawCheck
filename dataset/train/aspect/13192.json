{"The expert": "Thomas Anderson, Vermont's Commissioner of Public Safety, made the claim that if Vermont legalizes a market for cannabis, roadway deaths and impaired driving would increase.", "The Vermont Department of Public Safety sent seven sources": "including five studies and two news articles, to support the claim that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased in Colorado and Washington since cannabis was legalized.", "It is mentioned that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists": "and law enforcement typically rely on blood tests which can detect THC in someone's system for weeks, making it difficult to determine the actual time of impairment.", "A study conducted in Washington reported that about nine months after cannabis was legally available for purchase": "the number of drugged driving citations began increasing at a rate of almost 10 percentage points per year. However, it remains unclear whether this increase was solely caused by the legalization of cannabis or by other factors."}
