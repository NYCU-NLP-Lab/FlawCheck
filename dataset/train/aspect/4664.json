{"Analysis of U": "S. tax returns: The expert mentions that Biden is citing an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2005, which shows that in 2006, the top 1 percent made 22.8 percent of all the income in the United States. This analysis provides empirical evidence to support the claim.", "Historical comparison": "The expert points out that Biden correctly states that the percentage of income captured by the top 1 percent has risen steadily since the 1970s. They mention that it began to soar in the 1980s and grew more quickly during the 1990s administration of Bill Clinton. This historical context helps verify the claim that the income disparity has increased over time.", "Comparison with previous presidency": "The expert mentions that in 2000, the year George Bush won the election, the top 1 percent made about 21.5 percent of all the income in the United States. By comparing this percentage with the 22.8 percent in 2006, the expert shows that there was an increase, although not a significant one. This comparison helps verify the claim that the income distribution changed during George Bush's presidency.", "Expert opinion": "The expert states that while some of Bush's policies may have favored the rich, it is not fair for Biden to solely attribute the entire rising income gap to Bush. By including this expert opinion, the verdict provides a balanced perspective and acknowledges that the issue of income disparity is complex and influenced by multiple factors."}
