{"Rep": "Greg Walden's claim is supported by a study conducted by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, which relied on federal statistics from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department. This provides a source of data to verify the claim.", "The claim is based on a comparison of the number of non": "farm jobs in Oregon before and after the implementation of the stimulus program. The claim states that there was a decrease of 18,300 jobs from February 2009 to July 2011. This specific comparison provides a measurable metric to assess the effectiveness of the stimulus program.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that there have been multiple reports and studies assessing the impact of the stimulus program, including one from the Congressional Budget Office. While these reports provide varying estimates of the number of jobs created or saved, they do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the program's impact on employment. This acknowledgment of different perspectives and limitations adds a critical viewpoint to the assessment of the claim's authenticity."}
