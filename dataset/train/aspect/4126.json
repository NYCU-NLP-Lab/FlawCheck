{"The survey conducted by the Latin American Public Opinion Project at Vanderbilt University was used as a primary source to verify the claim": "The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews with 1,596 individuals, making it a reliable source of data.", "The survey asked participants if they had any intention of going to live or work in another country in the next three years": "Approximately 25% of the participants responded positively, indicating some intention to migrate.", "Among the 25": "who expressed an intention to migrate, a subset of 39.2% said they were \"very likely\" to live and work in another country in the next three years. This subset represents a smaller proportion than the 40% figure cited by Senator Ron Johnson.", "The specific survey results reported by Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre were cited by Senator Johnson": "as well as U.S. versions of the story written by the Washington Examiner and the Daily Caller. However, these reports inaccurately conveyed the survey results, leading to an inflated claim of one-third of Guatemalans intending to migrate to the United States."}
