{"The claim made by Sen": "Bernie Sanders is that private insurance companies in the country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs, while the cost of administering the Medicare program is 2 percent.", "The expert": "s verdict states that the numbers provided by Sanders are generally accurate, but there are key differences between Medicare and private insurance that make the trade-off more complex.", "To verify the authenticity of the claim": "the expert turned to the 2017 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, which listed total Medicare expenditures of $678.7 billion for 2016, with administrative expenses amounting to $9.2 billion, or 1.4 percent.", "However": "the expert also notes that some administrative costs for Medicare are handled by the Social Security system, and using the current administrative costs for Medicare may not translate directly if the entire population were to be covered."}
