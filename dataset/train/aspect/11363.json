This aspect was used to support the claim of substantial subsidies.", "7": "500 tax credit offered by the IRS: The expert mentions that the biggest portion of the subsidies mentioned in the claim comes from a $7,500 tax credit offered by the IRS to the first 200,000 buyers of the Volt or other electric cars from GM. This tax credit was a significant factor in the calculation of the subsidies received per vehicle sold. The expert includes this aspect as evidence supporting the claim.", "Sales figures of the Volt": "The expert refers to the sales figures of the Volt provided by General Motors. At the time of the hearing, approximately 6,000 Volts had been sold.
