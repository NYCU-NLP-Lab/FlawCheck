{"The claim is based on a television ad by Steve Kagen": "s campaign, which accuses Reid Ribble of wanting to phase out Social Security. The ad includes a video snippet of Ribble saying, \"Somehow we have to establish a phase-out of the current Social Security system.\"", "The ad does not provide any additional evidence or sources to support the claim": "other than the video of Ribble speaking at a campaign forum organized by the Fox Valley Initiative, a tea party group. The video cuts Ribble off mid-sentence, so it is unclear what his full statement was.", "The DCCC": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) also weighed in against Ribble, using language similar to Kagen's ad, stating that Ribble would \"dismantle Social Security and take away the guaranteed retirement benefits\" of seniors. However, no specific evidence or sources are provided to support this claim either.", "The fact": "checking organization, PolitiFact Wisconsin, reached out to Kagen's campaign for more information and clarification on the accusation against Ribble, but received no response. They also requested an interview with Kagen himself, but he did not respond. This lack of response from the campaign adds to the difficulty in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
