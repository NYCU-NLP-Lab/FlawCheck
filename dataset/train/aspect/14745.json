{"The source of the claim": "The expert mentions that the claim originated from the fake news website World News Daily Report in October 2015. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim can be questioned due to its source being a known purveyor of fictional stories.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert states that the story about Wendy Robinson saving LAPD officers with her AK-47 assault rifle is pure fantasy and written for entertainment purposes only. This suggests that there is no supporting evidence or credible witnesses to verify the claim.", "Disclaimers on the website": "The expert highlights the disclaimer on the World News Daily Report website, which states that all characters in their articles are entirely fictional. This further undermines the credibility of the claim and suggests that it should not be taken seriously.", "Similar fictional stories": "The expert mentions other examples of \"badass granny\" stories circulating online, such as \"Grandma Beats Up Airport Security Guards\" and \"93-Year-Old Grandma Kills 'Knockout Game' Thug.\" This indicates a pattern of fictional stories involving elderly women engaging in extraordinary acts, further casting doubt on the authenticity of the claim."}
