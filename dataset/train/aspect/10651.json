Devin Nunes, the House intelligence committee chairman. Nunes stated that he reviewed \"intelligence reports\" showing \"incidental collection\" on some unnamed Trump transition team members, but he believed the collection was legally obtained.", "Unsupported tweets": "The expert points out that Trump's tweets, in which he described Obama as a \"bad (or sick) guy!\" and accused him of illegal wiretapping, are still unsupported on multiple levels based on Nunes' account of the intelligence reports.", "New information claim": "Trump claimed in an interview that the \"new information\" from Nunes proved his tweets about a \"Watergate/Nixon\"-style scandal were right.
