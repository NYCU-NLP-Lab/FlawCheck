{"The claim was made by California State Treasurer John Chiang during a Facebook live video on August 13": "2017, where he stated, \"Since I\u2019ve been the state treasurer, we\u2019ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent.\"", "The claim was supported by data provided by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee": "which is headed by John Chiang. The committee awards federal tax credits that serve as a catalyst for building affordable housing in the state.", "The claim was further backed by the nonprofit California Housing Partnership": "whose president, Matt Schwartz, stated that these tax credits are the driving force for as much as 95 percent of the state's affordable housing construction each year.", "The claim was clarified by representatives for the treasurer": "who stated that the term \"building, construction\" includes both new construction and the rehabilitation of existing affordable housing units. They also provided a fact sheet that promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, specifying that these units were either built or rehabilitated."}
