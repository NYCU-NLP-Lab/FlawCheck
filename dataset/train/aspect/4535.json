{"The claim is based on two liberal sources": "the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a report prepared by the staff of a Democratic U.S. senator active on budget issues. These sources provide evidence to support the claim that Tommy Thompson wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires while raising taxes on the middle class.", "The claim is related to U": "S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, which Tommy Thompson endorsed without qualification. While the claim does not directly cite Thompson's own plan, it is reasonable to examine the impact of Ryan's plan since Thompson supports it.", "The claim is supported by previous fact": "checking by experts. In June, the claim that Thompson's plan amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent was rated Mostly True based on IRS data. This provides additional evidence to support the claim that Thompson's plan benefits millionaires.", "Thompson": "s campaign did not dispute the analysis that his plan benefits the top 1 percent. Instead, they argued that the tax cut for the wealthy is necessary because the top 1 percent already pay a significant portion of all income taxes collected. This response from Thompson's campaign adds credibility to the claim."}
