{"The claim is supported by a statement made by Martha Laning": "chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, during an interview on a liberal radio talk show. She specifically mentioned that $5 million has been spent against Tammy Baldwin, which is five times more than the amount spent against all other Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents up for election in 2018 combined.", "The claim is further backed by an article published in the Huffington Post": "which reported on the spending of conservative groups against Baldwin. The article was based on data collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending based on reports made to the Federal Election Commission.", "The expert": "s verdict also highlights the fact that Democrats are defending 25 U.S. Senate seats in 2018, and Wisconsin is considered to be one of the hardest seats for Democrats to keep. This suggests that conservative groups may indeed be targeting Baldwin with substantial financial resources."}
