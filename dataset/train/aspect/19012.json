{"Lack of evidence in Churchill collections": "The expert found no evidence in multiple Churchill collections that he ever said or wrote the quote in question. This lack of attribution in reputable sources suggests that the claim is not authentic.", "Unreliable sources": "The quote is primarily found in unsourced Facebook posts and meme generator websites, which are not considered reliable sources of information. The expert noted that the quote is almost always attributed to Churchill in these sources, further casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Churchill experts": "opinions: The expert mentioned Richard Langworth, a senior fellow at the Churchill Project, who includes the quote in his list of \"All the 'Quotes' Winston Churchill Never Said.\" Langworth states that there is no attribution for the quote, reinforcing the notion that it is not a genuine Churchill statement. Quote Investigator, a website that tracks down quotations, also found no substantive evidence linking Churchill to the quote.", "Earliest instance of the quote": "The expert highlighted that the earliest instance of the quote, dating back to 1937, was anonymous. This suggests that the quote was circulating before it was falsely attributed to Churchill in the 2000s, further undermining its authenticity."}
