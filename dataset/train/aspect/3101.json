{"The OBR": "s forecast: The expert mentions that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects real household disposable incomes to be 2.8% higher in 2020/21 than they are currently. This forecast contradicts the claim that families will be \u00a31,250 a year worse off in 2020 due to Brexit.", "National income decline": "The expert explains that the OBR expects national income in 2020/21 to be about \u00a350 billion lower than it would have been if the UK had voted to remain in the EU. However, this decline in national income per household is not the same as a decline in household income.", "Factors affecting household income": "The expert highlights that household income is influenced by various factors such as taxes, benefits, prices, and wages. Simply dividing national income by the number of households won't accurately determine how real incomes will change for individual families.", "Uncertainty and alternative outlooks": "The expert mentions that there is an unusual amount of uncertainty in the forecast, and it would be incorrect to present the OBR's expectations as definite future facts. Additionally, the Bank of England has produced a more pessimistic outlook, which suggests that real household disposable income is expected to rise by a little over 6% between 2016 and 2021."}
