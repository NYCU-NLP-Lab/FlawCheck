{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that Louise Mensch, the originator of the claim, did not provide any evidence to support her assertion that the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson were funded by Russia or Russian interests. This lack of evidence undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Organic nature of the protests": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the unrest in Ferguson unfolded organically, driven by the outrage and grief of the local community following the shooting of Michael Brown. The protests were not orchestrated or funded by external entities, as suggested by the claim.", "Documentation by witnesses and media": "The expert's verdict mentions that the events in Ferguson were well-documented by both residents using camera phones and the news media. This documentation provides a clear timeline of events, from the moment of the shooting to the subsequent marches and street violence, further contradicting the claim of external funding.", "Lack of rationale for funding": "The expert's verdict questions the claim's logic by highlighting that no explanation was provided as to why a \"riot\" would require funding. The spontaneous nature of the protests and the genuine emotions of the community make it unlikely that external funding was necessary for their occurrence."}
