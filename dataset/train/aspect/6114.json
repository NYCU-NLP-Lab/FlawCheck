This suggests that there are logistical barriers to her candidacy.", "Clinton": "s public denials: The expert mentions that Clinton has made flat out denials of running for president again, stating \"I\u2019m not running.\" This direct contradiction to the claim further supports the argument against her potential candidacy.", "Mixed signals from Clinton and others": "The expert highlights conflicting statements and actions from Clinton and those close to her. For example, while some articles suggest that Clinton's behavior indicates she is considering a run, others quote her denying any plans to do so. This inconsistency adds to the uncertainty surrounding the claim."}
