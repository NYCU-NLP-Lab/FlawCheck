{"The construction of major water storage projects in California since the 1970s": "The expert's verdict examines the claim made by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that no major water storage projects have been completed in California since the 1970s. The expert investigates the State Water Project, the Central Valley Water Project, and regional water districts' projects to assess the validity of this claim.", "Completion dates of significant water infrastructure projects": "The expert's analysis reveals that the State Water Project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s. The Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley, was also completed in the early 1970s. This information is crucial in evaluating the claim's accuracy.", "Existence of storage projects in the 1990s": "The expert's research uncovers that several significant storage projects were constructed by regional water districts in the 1990s. This finding challenges the claim that no major water storage projects have been built since the 1970s, highlighting the need for a nuanced interpretation.", "Definition of": "major\" water storage projects: The expert questions the criteria used by McCarthy's spokesman to define \"major\" water storage projects. The spokesman mentions that the last major reservoir/dam built in California was New Melones Reservoir in 1978. However, the expert points out that the spokesman did not explain why reservoirs with a capacity of one million acre-feet or more are considered \"major.\" This aspect raises the need for clarification and further examination of the claim's specificity."}
