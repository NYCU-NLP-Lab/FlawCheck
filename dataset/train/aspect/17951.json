{"The claim is based on a statement made by Rep": "Jackie Speier, who is known for advocating for gun control and stopping sexual assaults.", "The claim is supported by an NBC news article that cites data from a 2017 Violence Policy Center report called": "When Men Murder Women.\" This report analyzed 2015 homicide data collected by the FBI.", "The report found that on average": "2.54 female victims were killed by an intimate partner per day in the United States, which somewhat supports Speier's statement. However, the report does not specify the ages of the women.", "Other domestic violence prevention groups": "such as the National Organization for Women and the American Psychological Association, have also cited similar statistics, although some of their data is a decade or more older."}
