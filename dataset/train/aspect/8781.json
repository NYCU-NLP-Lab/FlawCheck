{"Reverse image search": "The expert performed a reverse image search of the photo in question and found it in a 2015 Chicago Tribune article about the city welcoming the KKK. This search helped verify the origins of the photo and its connection to a different event.", "Caption and context": "The caption of the photo in the Chicago Tribune article stated that it depicted \"Thousands of Klansmen gather in August 1921 for an initiation ceremony on a farm near Lake Zurich owned by Charles Weeghman, who owned the Chicago Cubs.\" This information provided crucial context and contradicted the claim that the photo was from the Democratic National Convention of 1924.", "Historical records": "The expert referenced historical records, such as articles from The New York Times and PolitiFact, which confirmed that the Democratic National Convention of 1924 took place at Madison Square Garden in New York. These records also highlighted the influence of the KKK within the Democratic Party during that time. By comparing this information with the photo, it became evident that the photo did not depict the convention.", "Facebook": "s flagging and fact-checking: The expert mentioned that the post containing the claim was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation. This indicates that the claim was reviewed by fact-checkers and deemed inaccurate. The fact that Facebook took action to address the claim adds credibility to the expert's verdict."}
