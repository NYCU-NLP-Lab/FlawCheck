{"The claim made by the campaign committee for House Democrats is that eight House Republicans": "stood with Q, not you\" because they voted against impeaching then-President Donald Trump for inciting the violent insurrection at the Capitol.", "The targeted Republicans are not known to be actual supporters of QAnon": "a conspiracy theory that falsely claims a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. Some QAnon followers participated in the January 6th riot based on false claims of election theft.", "While all eight members named by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee voted against impeaching Trump for a second time": "three of them (Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Don Bacon, and Young Kim) supported a resolution to censure Trump for his role in the attack on Congress.", "The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is spending over": "500,000 on an ad campaign that accuses the targeted Republicans, along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, of being too weak to stand up to President Trump and the QAnon mob. The ads claim that each of the Republicans \"stood with Q, not you,\" but it is misleading to suggest they all support QAnon solely based on their opposition to Trump's second impeachment."}
