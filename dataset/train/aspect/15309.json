This information supports the idea that multiple events were occurring simultaneously, but it does not verify the claim of a direct energy weapon.", "Conspiracy theory and lack of evidence": "The expert acknowledges the conspiracy theory that ties the meteor, garage fire, and controlled burn together as a result of a direct energy weapon. However, they emphasize the lack of evidence supporting this theory and highlight the confusion between the videos of the meteor and the photographs showing a ray of energy."}
