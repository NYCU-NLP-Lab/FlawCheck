{"The claim is based on a statistic reported by Pulitzer Prize": "winning journalist Tina Rosenberg in the New York Times on June 14, 2016.", "The statistic is derived from a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children": "s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), which reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by the age of 18.", "The data used to support the claim is outdated": "as it comes from 2007 reports. The most recent data available is from the country's 2013 Demographic and Health Survey.", "The survey data does not provide specific information on marriage rates for girls aged 18 and under": "so the claim relies on extrapolating data from the age group of women aged 20 to 24."}
