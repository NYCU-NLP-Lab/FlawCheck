{"The claim made by Governor Rick Perry stating that both creationism and evolution are taught in Texas public schools was verified through his own statement during a campaign event in New Hampshire": "This statement was reported by ABC News in a blog post.", "The expert referred to the U": "S. Supreme Court's ruling on teaching creationism in public schools, which deemed it unconstitutional due to its religious endorsement. The expert, Kristi Bowman, a law professor at Michigan State University, highlighted a 1987 Supreme Court decision that struck down a Louisiana law requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution.", "The current science curriculum standards in Texas were examined to determine if they mention the teaching of creationism": "It was found that the standards make no mention of creationism but emphasize the teaching of evolutionary theory in high school biology classes. The standards require students to analyze and evaluate scientific explanations using empirical evidence and critical thinking.", "The process of revising the curriculum standards in Texas drew national attention": "with some conservatives advocating for provisions that could cast doubt on evolution. However, a compromise was reached, and the final version of the standards removed the requirement to teach creationism. This information was reported in a news article by the Austin American-Statesman."}
