{"Ralph Reed": "s statement: The expert's verdict highlights that Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, made the claim that \"social science is irrefutable\" that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad. This statement serves as the basis for the claim being discussed.", "Focus on quantity of parents": "not gender: The expert's verdict points out that the social science statistics Reed referred to actually focus on the effects of children growing up without a father in a one-parent household, rather than comparing gay and straight parents. This aspect highlights that the studies Reed mentioned do not directly support his claim about gay parents.", "Lack of comparison between gay and straight marriages": "The expert's verdict mentions that neither Reed's book nor the Brookings Institution report he referenced draw any comparison between gay and straight marriages. This aspect emphasizes that the evidence provided does not address the specific claim about gay parenting.", "Critique focused on one parent versus two": "The expert's verdict states that the research cited by Reed, such as Sara McLanahan's Growing Up With a Single Parent, does not include any information on gay parenting. Instead, it focuses on the presence of one parent versus two. This aspect indicates that the evidence Reed used is not directly relevant to the claim being made."}
