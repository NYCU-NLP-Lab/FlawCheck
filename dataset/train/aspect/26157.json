{"The claim that Rep": "Trey Gowdy was given the highest level of security clearance possible with an executive order from the President himself is false.", "The White House": "s log of presidential actions does not list any executive order granting Gowdy the highest level of security clearance.", "The Federal Register": "s lists of executive orders in 2017 and 2018 also do not include any such order.", "Members of Congress already have access to classified intelligence reports by virtue of their elected positions": "and Gowdy is also a member of the House intelligence committee."}
