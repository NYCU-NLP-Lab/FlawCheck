{"Comparison of available ICU beds between Boone County and Orange County": "The expert's verdict mentions that Mizzou Chancellor Mun Choi compared the number of available ICU beds in Boone County (where University of Missouri is located) and Orange County (where University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill is located). This comparison was used to support the claim that Boone County has a larger number of ICU beds.", "Data from Johns Hopkins University": "The expert's verdict states that Choi's math is based on data from Johns Hopkins University. However, it is mentioned that this data may not provide a complete count of ICU beds. Despite this limitation, the data from Johns Hopkins University was used as a basis for the comparison.", "Data from The Leapfrog Group": "Another database mentioned in the expert's verdict is from The Leapfrog Group, a non-profit organization advocating transparency in healthcare. This database lists UNC Medical Center as having 82 ICU beds, which is significantly more than the number reported by Johns Hopkins University. This suggests that there may be discrepancies in the available data sources.", "Location and proximity of hospitals": "The expert's verdict mentions that Chapel Hill, where UNC is located, lies near three counties and is close to many more hospitals' ICU beds. This aspect highlights the potential influence of nearby hospitals on the availability of ICU beds in Orange County, which may affect the accuracy of the claim's comparison."}
