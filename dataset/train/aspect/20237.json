{"The fake CNN image": "The expert identified that the image circulating on social media, claiming to be a screen capture of a CNN story, was clearly fake. The expert pointed out that it is highly unlikely for a major news outlet to label a story as \"breaking news\" with an obvious misspelling of \"coma\" as \"comma.\"", "Lack of evidence from legitimate news organizations": "The expert found no evidence that CNN or any other reputable news organization had covered the story. This lack of coverage raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Similar but different stories circulating on social media": "The expert discovered that a similar story had been circulating on social media since mid-2016, with variations dating back to 2011. This suggests that the claim may be a recycled or fictional narrative that has been modified over time.", "Coverage on a South African junk news website": "The expert found that a South African junk news website, ABCNews.co.za, had covered a version of the story in 2018. However, the article did not mention a coma and used a different narrative. This further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
