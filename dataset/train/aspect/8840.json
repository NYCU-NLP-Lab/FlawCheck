{"The claim is based on a statement made by state Rep": "Mary Elizabeth Coleman during a General Laws Committee Hearing, where she cited alarming statistics about the average age of entry into prostitution and the life expectancy of girls involved in it.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions a long-term study conducted in Colorado Springs, which tracked over 1,600 female sex workers from 1967 to 1999. This study found that 100 of the participants died over the course of the 33-year study, suggesting that the life expectancy of sex workers may not be as low as the claim suggests.", "Additionally": "the expert's verdict refers to a survey conducted by COYOTE-RI, a sex work advocacy group in Rhode Island, which found that the average age of entry into prostitution was 22 and the average age of the respondents was 33 years old. This contradicts the claim's assertion that girls enter into prostitution at age 14 and have a life expectancy of only 7 years."}
