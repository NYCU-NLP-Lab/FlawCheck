{"Verification of Biden": "s financial status in 1973: The expert's verdict mentions that Biden's campaign provided a 1974 Delaware newspaper article that had incomplete figures on Biden's finances. Although it was challenging to determine his exact net worth, the article supported Biden's claim of being one of the poorest men in Congress at the time.", "Comparison to other members of Congress": "The article mentioned above compared Biden's financial status only to the two other members of Delaware's congressional delegation in 1973. This comparison helped assess Biden's relative poverty within the context of his colleagues in Congress.", "Limited availability of financial disclosure documents": "The expert's verdict states that the Center for Responsive Politics provided a 1973 summary of financial disclosures made by some members of the House and Senate. However, the actual disclosure documents were not available, making it difficult to obtain concrete information about Biden's net worth in 1973.", "Rankings of Biden": "s wealth in later years: Biden's campaign provided rankings from 2005, 2006, and 2007, which were based on the wealth of government officials. Although these rankings indicated that Biden ranked near the bottom in terms of wealth, it is important to note that they did not account for the additional decade Biden spent in government after those years."}
