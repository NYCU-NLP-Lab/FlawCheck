{"Unlikelihood of direct lightning strikes": "The expert points out that direct lightning strikes to the body, similar to the one shown in the video, are uncommon and account for only about 3-5% of lightning-related injuries. The chances of receiving such a strike twice in a short period of time without suffering extensive injuries or being killed are exceedingly low.", "Lack of immediate medical attention": "The expert mentions that in the absence of immediate medical attention, direct lightning strikes are associated with high morbidity, especially when they involve the head. Lightning strikes near the head can cause multiple problems by entering the eyes, ears, and mouth.", "Inconsistency with typical lightning strike victims": "The expert notes that most victims who survive lightning strikes experience what is known as a side flash, where a portion of the current jumps from a taller object to the victim. The video, on the other hand, depicts a direct strike, which is less common.", "Staged": "created nature of the video: The expert concludes that the video is certainly a staged or created one, rather than actual camera footage. The reasons for this determination are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the expert's analysis of the video and the unlikelihood of the events depicted."}
