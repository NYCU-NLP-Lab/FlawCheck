{"The expert": "s verdict acknowledges that while some aspects of President Trump's description are inaccurate, such as the mode of transportation (horse and carriage vs. train), others are fairly accurate, such as the fact that Lincoln wrote and revised the speech before delivering it. This aspect verifies the claim that Lincoln wrote and delivered the Gettysburg Address."}
