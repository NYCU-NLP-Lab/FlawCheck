{"Gemma": "s statement about Providence having \"amongst the highest tax rate(s) in the entire country\" was supported by a report from the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. This report compared the commercial property tax rates of the largest city in each state, as well as the District of Columbia and the two next largest cities in Illinois and New York. Providence ranked second highest for commercial property taxes among these cities, behind only Detroit.", "The Gemma campaign spokesperson also referenced a PolitiFact item from February": "which checked a claim by Governor Chafee that Providence had the second highest commercial property tax in the country. The PolitiFact item referred to the same Minnesota Taxpayers Association study, as well as a report by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed policy group in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state tax comparisons. According to the Tax Foundation's draft report, Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C.", "The expert also mentioned that Gemma": "s statement about tax rates could be misleading, and they assumed he was referring to the tax burden rather than just the tax rate. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was verified by considering the overall tax burden faced by residents and businesses in Providence.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentioned that Gemma's campaign provided evidence to support the claim, indicating that the authenticity was verified through the provision of relevant and credible sources, such as the Minnesota Taxpayers Association report and the PolitiFact item."}
