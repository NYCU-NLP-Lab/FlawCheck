{"The video was originally posted on the Facebook page of a Washington": "based company called Matts Tree & Landscape, along with a message about the start of \"allergy season.\" This provides evidence that the video is not a random or manipulated clip, but rather a genuine observation made by a reputable company.", "The video includes a small portion of a company sign that displays the first three digits of a phone number": "425, a Seattle area code), a logo, and the first two letters of the company name (\"MA\"). This further supports the authenticity of the video as it matches the information associated with Matts Tree & Landscape.", "The claim that the video shows a large cloud of pollen falling from a toppled tree is consistent with the explanation provided by Sheila McCormick": "an adjunct professor of plant and microbial biology at the University of California, Berkeley. She states that such pollen clouds are not unusual and that most plants produce more pollen than is needed.", "The existence of a similar video from May 2018": "posted by a Kentucky Facebook user and picked up by local and national news outlets, further confirms the authenticity of the claim. This suggests that the phenomenon of large pollen clouds falling from trees is not isolated and has been observed and documented before."}
