{"The design of the new Pier includes a small": "open-air cafe run by the Columbia restaurant on the Lens structure's \"promontory,\" which overlooks the water. This indicates that there is no planned air-conditioned restaurant on the Lens itself.", "The new plan for the Pier does not allocate nearly the same amount of space for restaurants as the previous inverted pyramid Pier": "This suggests that the lack of a full-size restaurant is a deliberate decision in the design.", "The Columbia restaurant owners have confirmed plans for a new Columbia restaurant at the approach to the Pier known as the Hub": "which will have about 8,000 square feet of air-conditioned space as well as outdoor and rooftop seating. This further confirms that the main restaurant will not be on the Lens structure.", "The Columbia restaurant group is considering the possibility of enclosing the cafe space at the new Pier": "but final planning stages have not yet begun. This indicates that the decision to have an open-air cafe is not final and may be subject to change."}
