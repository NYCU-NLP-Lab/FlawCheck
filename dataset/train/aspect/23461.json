{"The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim made by Kellyanne Conway is regarding the future of Medicaid spending under the Senate Republican health care bill, specifically the projected $800 billion in Medicaid savings.", "The expert points out that while Conway argues that these are not cuts to Medicaid": "there is a long-running debate over what qualifies as a cut. The expert acknowledges that future savings are not always considered cuts, but in the case of the GOP health care bill, there are indeed cuts that go beyond dollars spent.", "To verify the authenticity of the claim": "the expert refers to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates for both the current law and the Senate bill. The CBO estimates that under current law, the federal government would spend about $4.62 trillion on Medicaid from 2018 through 2026. However, under the Senate bill, total Medicaid spending would be about $770 billion less.", "The expert also highlights specific steps taken by the Senate bill to restrain Medicaid spending": "These include rolling back eligibility, eliminating the option for Medicaid coverage for over 2.5 million people in states that didn't expand eligibility, and making federal payments to expansion states less generous. These measures contribute to the overall cuts in Medicaid spending under the GOP health care proposals."}
