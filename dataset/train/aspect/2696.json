{"The expert": "s verdict mentions that Ebola is not an airborne infection and does not spread through coughing or sneezing, which contradicts the claim that it is \"incredibly contagious\" and \"easy to catch.\"", "The World Health Organization states that Ebola spreads through direct contact with blood": "secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected people. This means that the most common way Ebola is transmitted is through direct contact with vomit, blood, or fecal matter of an infected patient.", "The risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces and objects is low": "according to the World Health Organization. Most studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients.", "The epidemiological evidence suggests that Ebola is less infectious than many other viruses that commonly affect people": "such as influenza. The evidence shows that not many people come into contact with infected fluids, and some people who do spend time around an infected patient don't get the virus. Additionally, Ebola causes death in 50 percent of patients, which sparks extra precaution and suggests it is not as easily transmissible as claimed."}
