{"The claim made by Governor Chris Christie during his State of the State address was that only three students graduated college ready in the entire public school system in Camden last year": "2. The claim was based on a statistic recently cited by Camden Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard, which referred to students whose SAT scores met the \"SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark\" developed by the College Board.", "The benchmark": "a combined score of 1550 on the SAT, indicates a 65 percent likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during a student's first year at a four-year college, according to the College Board.", "The actual statistic related to the number of 12th": "graders enrolled in Camden during the 2011-12 school year who took the SATs and hit that benchmark, which was only three out of the 214 students who took the exam."}
