{"Lack of documentation from Mark Twain": "The expert notes that none of the websites attributing the quote to Mark Twain provide any documentation of when and where he said or wrote these words. The absence of any mention of the quote in Twain's literary works, letters, or recorded speeches raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Varying wording of the quotation": "The wording of the quote changes from source to source, suggesting that it has no fixed origin. Different versions such as \"If voting made any difference, it would be illegal\" or \"If voting made any difference it would never be allowed\" further weaken the claim's authenticity.", "Alternative attributions": "The expert mentions that other individuals, such as peace activist Phillip Berrigan and anarchist writer Emma Goldman, have also been credited with originating this expression. However, there is no evidence to support their connection to the quote, casting doubt on its true source.", "Non": "attributed versions of the sentiment: The expert provides an example of a similar sentiment expressed in a column written by Robert S. Borden in 1976. This suggests that the quote may have originated from an unknown source and later falsely attributed to famous individuals like Mark Twain to enhance its credibility."}
