{"The claim was made by Austin legislator Donna Howard in a September 2016 commentary in the Austin American": "Statesman.", "Howard relied on a Legislative Budget Board staff projection to reach her conclusion of 31 percent of school districts still receiving less funding per pupil than before the budget cuts of 2011": "3. The projection indicated that 31.3 percent of the state's school districts were projected to have lower M&O revenue per WADA in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2011, and 23.8 percent were projected to have lower M&O revenue per WADA in fiscal year 2017.", "The Legislative Budget Board planned to update their model with new student counts and property value estimates": "which could potentially change the percentages mentioned in the projection."}
