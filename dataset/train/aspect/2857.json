{"Comparison of unemployment statistics": "The expert checked Florida's most recent unemployment statistics to verify the claim. They found that the state's unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percent from January 2011 to February 2011, indicating an increase in non-agricultural jobs during that period.", "Source analysis": "The expert examined the sources provided by the Pink Slip Rick campaign, which claimed that 331,247 jobs were lost. They evaluated the credibility of these sources, such as the Florida Center for Economic and Fiscal Policy, to determine the accuracy of the claim.", "Evaluation of supporting evidence": "The expert analyzed the specific reasons cited by the Pink Slip Rick campaign for the job losses, including moving Medicaid to a state-run program, stalling the SunRail contract, layoffs from the Department of Children and Families, teacher layoffs, job losses due to rejecting high-speed rail, and cuts from the state prison system. They assessed the validity of these reasons and whether they accounted for the claimed number of lost jobs.", "Discrepancy investigation": "The expert identified a discrepancy of approximately 9,700 jobs between the Pink Slip Rick campaign's count and the provided sources. They further examined the spreadsheet provided by Susannah Randolph to understand the additional \"lost jobs\" and determine their accuracy in supporting the claim."}
