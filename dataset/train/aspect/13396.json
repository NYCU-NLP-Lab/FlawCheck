{"The Kansas City Star investigation": "The claim's authenticity was verified by the fact that it was based on a thorough investigation conducted by The Kansas City Star, a reputable news outlet. The investigation found evidence that contradicted Steve Watkins' claim of building his company from scratch.", "Watkins": "own statements: Watkins' own statements during campaign events and GOP meetings were used as evidence to verify the claim. He repeatedly boasted about starting a small business and growing it from a few people to a team of 470, which supported the claim that he misrepresented his involvement in the company.", "Financial disclosure forms": "Watkins' federal financial disclosure forms were examined to verify the claim. These forms did not list VIAP Inc. as an asset but showed that he earned income from Versar, the parent company of VIAP. This discrepancy indicated that Watkins did not own VIAP as he had claimed.", "Testimonies from company officials": "The Kansas City Star also spoke with several Versar company officials who could not recall or remember Watkins. This lack of recognition from individuals who were in leadership positions during the time Watkins claimed to have worked for the company further supported the claim that he had exaggerated his role and involvement."}
