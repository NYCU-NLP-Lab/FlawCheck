{"Certification of election results": "All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, showing that Joe Biden won with 306 electoral votes, while Donald Trump received 232. This certification process is a crucial aspect that verifies the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of evidence for voter fraud": "Election officials in every state have stated that there was no significant voter fraud during the voting process. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, along with its election partners, declared the 2020 election as \"the most secure in American history.\" Former Attorney General William Barr also confirmed that the Justice Department found no evidence of widespread fraud. This lack of evidence supports the authenticity of the claim.", "Dismissal of lawsuits": "None of the 62 lawsuits filed by Donald Trump and his allies in state and federal courts have successfully proven that voter fraud affected the outcome of the election. These lawsuits were dismissed by both Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges, further reinforcing the authenticity of the claim.", "Recounts and rejection of fraud claims": "In Georgia, where Biden had a narrow margin of victory, two recounts were conducted, including one done by hand, which reaffirmed his win. Georgia's Republican Secretary of State has repeatedly refuted claims of voter fraud affecting the election. This aspect demonstrates that the election process was thoroughly examined and supports the authenticity of the claim."}
