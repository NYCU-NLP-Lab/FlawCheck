{"Verification of minimum wage": "The expert checked the historical minimum wage rate in 1978, which was $2.65 per hour. They calculated the earnings for someone working a minimum-wage summer job for 13 weeks, 40 hours per week, to determine the total income earned.", "Examination of tuition cost": "The expert referred to data from the National Center for Education Statistics to determine the cost of tuition and fees for the 1978-79 school year. They found that the tuition for in-state residents attending a four-year public university was $688.", "Consideration of additional costs": "The expert noted that while the meme only mentioned tuition, the overall cost of attending a university would include room and board expenses. They found that the total cost, including room and board, was $2,145. However, for the purpose of verifying the claim, they focused solely on the tuition amount.", "Clarification of": "of their choice\": The expert pointed out that the claim mentioned \"a 4-year public university of their choice,\" but the data they used only referred to in-state tuition rates. Therefore, the claim was accurate for in-state tuition, but not for any university in the country with out-of-state rates that might exceed a summer's minimum-wage earnings."}
