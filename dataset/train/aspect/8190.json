{"The proposal to restore emergency unemployment benefits for five months was voted on by the U": "S. Senate, controlled by Democrats, but did not pass in the Republican-controlled House.", "Senator Jack Reed argued that the original proposal was": "fully paid for\" despite the U.S. government's significant debt. He claimed that the revenue would come from giving companies the option to lower their pension plan payments in the short term, resulting in more taxable profit for the government.", "The legislation also included a one": "year extension of customs fees, which were set to expire in nine years. This extension would generate additional revenue to cover the long-term costs associated with the proposed changes to the pension payment system.", "While the proposal was projected to generate enough revenue to cover the costs by the 2017 fiscal year": "it was acknowledged that in subsequent years, companies would have to pay extra into their pension plans, resulting in less taxable income and a loss of revenue for the government starting in 2020."}
