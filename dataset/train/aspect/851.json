{"Scratching one": "s face is a common signal that has been used for communication, but it is also a natural and common action that people do without any hidden meaning. The claim assumes that Clinton's face scratching during the debate was a deliberate signal, but it lacks evidence to support this assumption.", "The video provided by True Pundit does not offer any concrete proof or connection between Clinton": "s hand motions and her communication with Lester Holt. The creator of the video merely strings together unrelated events without providing any evidence of a secret signaling plot.", "The claim suggests that Clinton never made similar gestures in previous debates": "campaign appearances, or speeches. However, a cross-reference analysis of Clinton's past speeches and appearances shows that she has touched her face before, making the claim unfounded.", "It is important to note that both candidates": "Clinton and Trump, made similar gestures during the first presidential debate. This undermines the claim that these gestures were specific signals between Clinton and Holt, as they were not exclusive to her."}
