{"The data on SNAP participation shows a decrease of about 7 million Americans over the last three years": "indicating a reduction in food stamp recipients.", "However": "the data is incomplete and flawed due to reporting issues in North Carolina and discrepancies during the 2018-19 government shutdown, suggesting that the actual number of reductions may be slightly lower.", "The claim of lifting 10 million people off of welfare is imprecise since the term": "welfare\" encompasses various federal assistance programs, and the reductions in these programs do not add up to 10 million.", "SNAP participation was already declining before President Trump took office": "likely influenced by a growing economy and a falling official poverty rate since 2010. Additionally, the administration implemented stricter guidelines on who can receive benefits, potentially affecting future participation numbers."}
