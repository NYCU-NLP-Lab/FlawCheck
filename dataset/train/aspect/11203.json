{"The expert": "s verdict states that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security provides an annual estimate of the number of illegal immigrants in the United States. Their most recent estimate in January 2012 was 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants, which includes those who entered illegally and those who overstayed their visas.", "Several independent organizations": "such as Pew Research Center, the Center for Migration Studies, and the Center for Immigration Studies, also study illegal immigration and have arrived at similar figures of around 11-12 million unauthorized immigrants. These organizations calculate their estimates by subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born individuals documented in the U.S. census and adjusting for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census.", "The expert mentions that there are no credible": "research-based estimates supporting the claim of 30 million or more illegal immigrants. Jeffrey Passel, an expert on Hispanic immigration at the Pew Research Center, states that the 11-12 million range is widely accepted by researchers and immigration advocates regardless of their perspective.", "Steven Camarota": "research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, suggests that the total number of illegal immigrants has remained relatively constant in recent years, as the number of new arrivals has balanced out with those leaving or being deported. This implies that the claim of a sudden increase to 30 million or more is not supported by evidence."}
