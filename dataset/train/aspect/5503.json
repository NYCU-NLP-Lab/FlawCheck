{"The movie Category 7": "The End of the World was released in November 2005, which was 11 years and 10 months before Hurricane Irma's expected landfall in Florida on September 10, 2017. This disproves the claim that the movie predicted the arrival of hurricanes named Harvey and Irma.", "None of the storms or hurricanes depicted in the movie were named Harvey or Irma": "The claim that the movie featured two hurricanes with these names is false.", "The names of Atlantic hurricanes are predetermined and published in advance by the World Meteorological Association": "The list of potential hurricane names for future years is already known, and the filmmakers could have easily chosen the names Harvey or Irma from this publicly available list.", "Even if the claims about the movie were accurate": "there would be no sinister meaning behind it. The occurrence of hurricanes named Harvey and Irma is simply a coincidence, as hurricanes are natural weather phenomena and not human-engineered attacks."}
