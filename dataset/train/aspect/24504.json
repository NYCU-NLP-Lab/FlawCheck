{"The structural integrity of Hoover Dam required that no bodies or foreign objects be left in the concrete pour": "as even a small block of wood could create a weak spot in the structure.", "The dam was constructed in sections": "with each section allowed to set before the next was added. This deliberate sectioning created \"cold joints\" that were factored into the engineering plans, making it unlikely for a workman to be trapped in the wet concrete.", "The claim may have originated from rumors about a construction tragedy at the Fort Peck Dam in Montana": "where eight workers were buried in the debris and only two bodies were recovered. These rumors may have been mistakenly attributed to Hoover Dam.", "Another famous engineering marvel": "the Brooklyn Bridge, had 27 deaths during its construction, but none of the workers became part of the structure. This serves as a comparison to debunk the claim about bodies being entombed in Hoover Dam."}
