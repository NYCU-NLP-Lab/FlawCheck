{"Lack of official confirmation": "The expert found no press release or official statement from the Supreme Court confirming the change in motto. The official website of the Supreme Court also did not mention any such change.", "Social media claims": "The claim originated from a tweet by Sunil Astay of the Bhim Army, which included images of the alleged change in motto. However, the expert noted that Astay's tweet was the only source of this claim on social media.", "Deleted tweet": "Journalist Punya Prasun Bajpai had also tweeted the same images with the claim, but later deleted the post. The expert managed to take a screenshot of the tweet before it was deleted.", "Lack of historical evidence": "The expert checked the archives of the official Supreme Court website and found no evidence of the motto being changed. The phrase 'Yato Dharmastato Jai' appeared consistently on the website, even in snapshots taken before the alleged change was claimed to have occurred."}
