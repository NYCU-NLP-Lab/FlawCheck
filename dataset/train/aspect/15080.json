{"The historical context of the claim": "The expert's verdict provides information about the post-World War II trials and convictions of Japanese soldiers for war crimes, including charges of waterboarding. This historical context supports the claim.", "Corroboration from official records": "The expert's verdict mentions The Tokyo War Crimes Trials by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which were well-known post-war trials. The records from these trials show instances of water torture being inflicted on prisoners, supporting the claim.", "Testimony from an attorney specializing in the laws of war": "The expert's verdict refers to an essay written by Evan Wallach, an attorney specializing in the laws of war. Wallach's essay describes the techniques used in water torture during the post-war trials. This testimony further supports the claim.", "Comparison to other forms of water torture": "The expert's verdict mentions that supporters of the Bush-era interrogation techniques argue that the CIA's waterboarding was not as harsh as the torture used by Japanese soldiers. This comparison suggests that there were different degrees or methods of water torture employed, which strengthens the claim."}
