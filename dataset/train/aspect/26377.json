{"The age discrepancy": "The expert points out that Lev Parnas would have been approximately 18 years old at the time the photograph was taken, while the man in the photograph appears to be much older. This suggests that Parnas is not the person in the photograph.", "Lack of credible information": "The claim that the man in the photograph is Lev Parnas is not based on any credible information. It is solely based on the notion that the man bears a passing resemblance to Parnas. There is no evidence or documentation linking Parnas to the photograph.", "Context of the photograph": "The expert provides information about the context of the photograph, stating that it was taken at a birthday party for Trump's son, Eric, in 1990. This information is supported by the release of a book by Ivana Trump, the president's first wife, which includes the photograph with a caption identifying it as Eric Trump's birthday party.", "Media coverage and source reliability": "The expert mentions that the photograph received media attention in 2017 when it was published by ABC News in an article about Ivana Trump's book. The fact that a reputable news outlet published the photograph adds to its credibility, as compared to social media claims without reliable sources."}
