{"The claim was based on a Facebook Live video uploaded by Avi Dandiya": "where he alleged a conspiracy by the BJP to hack EVMs before elections. The video received a significant number of views and shares, indicating that many people believed the claim to be true.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking website, debunked another audio clip uploaded by Avi Dandiya in the past, which claimed that the BJP orchestrated the Pulwama terror attack. This previous debunking raised doubts about the credibility of Dandiya's claims.", "In the alleged audio conversation": "Amit Shah can be heard saying, \"\u092f\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u0924\u0940\u0928 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u0924\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u091a\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0925\u0940 (Preparations have been going on for three days.)\" This statement was taken from an interview Shah gave to Zee News's Sudhir Chaudhary in 2018, in a different context. This suggests that the audio conversation was manipulated by combining different parts of the interview.", "Another part of the manufactured audio conversation included Shah": "s response to Ajit Doval's warning about the consequences of hacking EVMs. Shah's reply, \"\u0905\u092c \u0907\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0901\u091a \u0915\u094c\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0917\u093e \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0913? \u0905\u092e\u0947\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e? (Who is going to investigate this? America?)\" was also manipulated by combining different parts of the Sudhir Chaudhary interview. This further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
