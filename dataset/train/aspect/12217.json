{"Lack of explicit mention in the USMCA": "The expert points out that there is no mention in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Mexico will pay for any border wall. This suggests that the claim of Mexico paying for the wall through the USMCA is not supported by the agreement itself.", "Insufficient new benefits in the trade agreement": "Economists argue that the new benefits to the U.S. in the USMCA are not significant enough to cover the cost of the wall. They state that there are no plausible assumptions that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion, which is the amount needed to pay for the wall.", "Similarity to NAFTA": "The expert highlights that the USMCA is very similar to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since there are not substantial economic shifts expected from the new agreement, it is difficult to argue that the USMCA will save the U.S. a significant amount of money compared to NAFTA.", "Insufficient concessions from Mexico": "According to a professor of business economics and public policy, none of the concessions won by U.S. negotiators in the USMCA are enough to offset the cost of a border wall. This suggests that Mexico's contributions through the trade agreement are not substantial enough to verify the claim."}
