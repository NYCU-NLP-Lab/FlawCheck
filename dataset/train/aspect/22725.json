{"The legal powers of the president": "Independent experts confirmed that the claim made by Senator James Risch regarding the president's ability to declassify information at any time without any process is accurate. They stated that the president, as commander in chief, holds the ultimate responsibility for classification and declassification.", "Delegation of authority": "Experts explained that lower-ranking officials in the chain of command handle classification and declassification duties because they have been delegated to do so directly by the president or by a presidential appointee. This highlights the president's role in determining who has the authority to handle classified information.", "Constitutional authority": "The majority ruling in the Supreme Court case Department of Navy vs. Egan emphasized that the president's authority to classify and control access to national security information stems from the constitutional investment of power in the president. This authority exists independently of any explicit congressional grant.", "Separation of powers": "Experts pointed out that any attempt by Congress to limit the president's authority to classify or declassify national security information, or to restrict sharing certain information with Russia, would raise significant constitutional issues related to the separation of powers."}
