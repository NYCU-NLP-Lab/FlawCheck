{"The expert": "s verdict is based on a Twitter town hall held by President Barack Obama on July 6, 2011, where he made the claim about young veterans having a higher unemployment rate than non-veterans. This event serves as the primary source of the claim.", "The expert verifies the claim by referring to federal statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "They found a recent table that specifically breaks down employment status for veterans and non-veterans, which confirms that young veterans indeed had a higher unemployment rate than non-veterans in May 2011.", "The expert acknowledges the potential volatility of the unemployment rate for post": "9/11 veterans due to their small representation in the entire labor force and the lack of seasonal adjustment in the numbers. However, they emphasize that even with this volatility, the unemployment rates for post-9/11 veterans consistently remained higher than those for non-veterans.", "The expert also mentions that the higher unemployment rate among post": "9/11 veterans is an exception rather than the norm. They highlight that veterans of earlier military actions typically have unemployment levels similar to or even lower than non-veterans, further emphasizing the distinctiveness of the situation for young veterans."}
