Schulz in 1968. Schulz's decision to include Franklin was a response to concerns about race relations in America, particularly in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. This information highlights Schulz's intention to address racial issues and his willingness to fight against opposition from the comic industry.", "The claim that seating Franklin alone on the opposite side of the table is racist is subjective": "The expert acknowledges that this aspect of the special can be interpreted differently by individuals. This highlights the importance of considering different perspectives and the subjective nature of determining racism in this context.", "Schulz": "s decision to include Franklin was influenced by his awareness of the discrimination, segregation, and hatred that existed during the civil rights movement. He was motivated by the accumulation of years of witnessing these injustices, rather than a sudden realization prompted by a specific event.
