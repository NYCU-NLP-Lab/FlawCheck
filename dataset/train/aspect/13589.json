The claim asserts that all the \"official\" mail-in ballots in the election had a secret watermark making them identifiable to \"elite units\" of the National Guard, which is not factually defensible or logically consistent.", "The claim originates from a regular InfoWars guest named Steve Pieczenik": "who is known for pushing conspiracy theories, including those related to the Sandy Hook mass shooting.", "Pieczenik cited unnamed sources within the government to support his alleged ballot fraud sting scheme": "but there is no evidence to substantiate these claims."}
