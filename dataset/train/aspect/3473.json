{"The claim made by MSNBC host Al Sharpton that the Texas Senate approved a bill to put a special label on insurance cards of Obamacare recipients with the letter": "S\" for subsidy.", "The original language of the bill": "HB 1514, did include reference to the letter \"S\" on identification cards or documents issued by qualified health plan issuers to enrollees who receive advance payment of the premium tax credit.", "The purpose of including the letter": "S\" on the identification cards was to indicate that a person's health insurance is being subsidized by the federal government.", "However": "the Texas bill does not specifically require the identification of those who use federal tax credits, as stated by Al Sharpton. Instead, all plans purchased through the federal exchange, regardless of whether they include a subsidy or not, would have ID cards marked as \"QHP\" to indicate that they were purchased through the online exchange."}
