{"The tally only includes daily deaths directly linked to a specific event resulting in mass fatality and leaves out the number of deaths from all causes": "This means that deaths from other causes, such as murder, heart attacks, or cancer, are not taken into account in the claim.", "The COVID": "19 pandemic has seen daily death totals that have surpassed those of events memorialized as national tragedies, including Pearl Harbor and 9/11. This aspect highlights the severity of the pandemic in terms of daily death counts compared to other significant events in American history.", "The claim misconstrues the comparison of the COVID": "19 death toll with other tragedies and natural disasters. While the pandemic is undoubtedly one of the deadliest events modern Americans have faced, the claim's ranking and listing of the \"deadliest days in American history\" are inaccurate and do not consider all historical events resulting in higher fatalities.", "The list provided in the claim omits significant events": "such as the 1918 flu pandemic, which is directly analogous to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of its impact on the United States. This omission undermines the claim's assertion of listing and ranking the deadliest days in American history."}
