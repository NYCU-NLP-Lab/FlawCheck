{"The claim made by Sen": "Dianne Feinstein that \"Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses\" was verified by examining the provision in the tax code that allows teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250.", "The": "1.6 billion figure mentioned in the claim was based on a study conducted by the National School Supply and Equipment Association, which found that teachers reported spending an average of $485 on school supplies, instructional materials, and other classroom materials in the 2012-2013 school year.", "However": "it was noted that the limit for deducting unreimbursed classroom expenditures is $250 per teacher. Therefore, out of the $485 spent by the average teacher, $235 would not be deductible. Adjusting for this, the approximate value of the lost deduction would be $825 million, not the $1.6 billion cited in the claim.", "Sen": "Feinstein's office later clarified the claim by stating that the average teacher spends $500 per year on school supplies and that the Republican plan would not allow them to deduct even $250 from their tax bill."}
