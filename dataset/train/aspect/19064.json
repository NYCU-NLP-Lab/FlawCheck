{"Discrepancy with historical facts": "The expert's verdict highlights the inconsistency of the claim by pointing out that the Vatican did not participate in the 1936 Olympics, where the claim stated the Vatican Women's Rifle Team took part.", "Unreliable source": "The expert dismisses the claim's credibility by mentioning that it originated from a humor website called BlandX, which is known for publishing jokes and false information.", "Lack of supporting evidence": "The expert states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the Vatican Women's Rifle Team existed or participated in any events, such as the 1936 Olympics or international tours.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert provides an alternative explanation for the photograph, suggesting that it was taken in 1957 at Camp Mishannock in Massachusetts. This explanation is supported by a photograph titled \"Row of Nuns Aiming Rifles\" from Corbis Images, which resembles the group of nuns in the claim's photograph."}
