{"The Facebook post and linked petition were deleted": "The fact that the original Facebook post and linked petition were deleted raises suspicion about the authenticity of the claim. This suggests that the source may have realized the information was false or misleading.", "L": "Oreal's denial of involvement: L'Oreal explicitly stated that they have nothing to do with the video in question and that the link between L'Oreal and the content is false. This denial from the company further supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic.", "Documentation of the monkey": "s injury and rescue: While the video does not depict an animal harmed through testing at L'Oreal, it does document a severely injured monkey named \"Fighter\" who was electrocuted by a high voltage tower in Mumbai, India. This aspect, although unrelated to L'Oreal, provides evidence of the existence of an injured monkey, which may have been mistakenly associated with L'Oreal's testing facility."}
