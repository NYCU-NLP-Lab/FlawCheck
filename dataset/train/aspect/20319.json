{"The senators cited a study conducted by Drexel University associate professor Mark Stehr": "which focused on 13 states that had eased or repealed Sunday liquor laws between 1995 and 2005. This study used data from the federal government's Fatality Analysis Reporting System to analyze the impact of Sunday alcohol sales on highway crash fatalities.", "The senators mentioned that other previous studies on this topic had reached mixed conclusions": "They pointed out that many of these studies were outdated, focused on only one state, and failed to consider other factors that could affect traffic safety.", "The senators highlighted the increase in crashes and fatalities after Sunday liquor sales were eased in New Mexico": "as reported in the study cited by Sen. Joshua McKoon. This specific example provided evidence to support their claim that easing alcohol sales laws on Sundays could lead to more traffic accidents and fatalities.", "Sen": "Vincent Fort emphasized the current accessibility of liquor in certain neighborhoods and urged others to \"do the math\" based on the numbers presented by Sen. McKoon. This aspect suggests that the senators considered the existing prevalence of alcohol consumption and its potential impact on traffic safety if Sunday sales were to be expanded."}
