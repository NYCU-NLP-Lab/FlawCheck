{"The claim is based on a statement made in a political ad by Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel": "who is running against incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown for the U.S. Senate seat in November.", "The claim refers to Brown giving": "huge bonuses to executives\" and cites Brown's vote on H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as evidence.", "The claim also mentions a March 17": "2009, article in The New York Times about the outcry over AIG paying $165 million in bonuses but does not directly link Brown to it.", "The expert": "s verdict clarifies that the root of the claim lies in a provision of the stimulus legislation, not in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that Brown and other senators voted for. This provision allowed companies like AIG, which had received TARP funds, to pay bonuses agreed upon before the bill's passage."}
