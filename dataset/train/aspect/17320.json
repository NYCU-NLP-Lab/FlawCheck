{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the Santa Fe school shooter was wearing an Antifa insignia. This lack of evidence is a crucial aspect in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Ongoing investigation": "The expert's verdict mentions that officials are still investigating the shooting and have not disclosed a motive. This indicates that the claim about the shooter wearing an Antifa symbol is not based on confirmed information or findings from the investigation.", "Inaccurate source": "The claim originated from a video by Mike Cernovich, who is known for spreading conspiracy theories. The expert's verdict highlights that Cernovich's video lacks credibility and that he himself stated, \"I didn't say Antifa did it. I'm just simply observing that the shooter was wearing a symbol of Antifa.\" This aspect emphasizes the unreliable nature of the source behind the claim.", "Inconsistent symbol": "The expert's verdict explains that Antifa typically uses a graphic of two single-color flags, not a hammer and sickle symbol. The pin featuring the hammer and sickle found on the shooter's Facebook page is associated with communism, not Antifa. This inconsistency between the claimed symbol and the actual symbol used by Antifa further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
