{"The claim was verified by examining reliable sources": "such as a 2006 study in the scientific journal Toxicon, which concluded that bites by the woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata, are virtually innocuous and not fatal to humans. This study provided scientific evidence contradicting the claim of a lethal bite.", "The expert investigated the species mentioned in the claim": "Dysdera crocata, and found that it is not new to the United States. The spider is known to be found from New England to Georgia and west to California. This information was obtained from Pennsylvania State University's College of Agriculture Sciences, which provided accurate details about the spider's distribution.", "Close": "up photographs of the spider were examined to compare them with known images of Dysdera crocata. By visually analyzing the spider's physical characteristics, it was determined that the spider shown in the photographs matched the known appearance of Dysdera crocata. This visual verification helped confirm the species identity.", "The expert considered the context and history of scarelore related to invasive and exotic animals": "They explained that messages alerting readers to supposed threats posed by new or previously unheard-of species often spread rapidly and may contain misinformation or deliberate scare-mongering. This understanding of the broader context helped the expert approach the claim with skepticism and critically evaluate the available evidence."}
