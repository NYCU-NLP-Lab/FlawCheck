{"The claim was made by Dawn Buckingham": "a physician and Texas senator, who used her position and co-authorship of a Senate-approved measure to ban sanctuary city policies as evidence for her claim.", "The claim refers to the new sanctuary policy adopted by the Travis County Sheriff": "s Office, which was announced by Sheriff Sally Hernandez in January 2017. This policy stated that the office would no longer automatically honor federal detainer requests, except in cases of serious crimes or with a court order or arrest warrant.", "Buckingham": "s claim of \"hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers\" being released was challenged by fact-checkers who questioned the evidence behind this number. Buckingham's spokesperson provided a statement from Buckingham stating that the sheriff's office had ignored hundreds of requests to detain inmates in the country illegally, but did not provide specific evidence to support this claim.", "The fact": "checkers conducted their own investigation and found that the latest count of released individuals under the new policy was 45 in eight days. This number contradicts Buckingham's claim of \"hundreds\" being released."}
