{"Comparison of federal revenues before and after the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act": "The expert's verdict states that federal revenues were down slightly in calendar year 2018 compared to the previous year, indicating that the claim of overall revenues being up about 10 percent is not accurate.", "Analysis of Treasury Department data": "The expert's verdict mentions that Treasury Department data shows federal receipts were down slightly in the first five months of fiscal year 2019 compared to the same period a year ago. This further supports the argument that the claim of a 10 percent increase in overall revenues is misleading.", "Evaluation of economic growth projections": "The expert's verdict highlights that the White House budget assumes stronger economic growth in 2019 than estimated by economic experts, with a projected real gross domestic product growth of 3.2 percent. However, the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents projected a lower growth rate of 2.3 percent. This suggests that the claim of a 10 percent increase in revenues may be based on overly optimistic economic assumptions.", "Lack of response from the White House": "The expert's verdict mentions that the White House was asked how Larry Kudlow arrived at the 10 percent increase in federal revenues, but no response was received. This lack of clarification raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim and suggests that Kudlow may have cherry-picked data to support his statement."}
