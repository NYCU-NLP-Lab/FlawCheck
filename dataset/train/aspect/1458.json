{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the comparison of the images used in the social media post": "The expert identifies that one photo shows members of the D.C. National Guard at the Lincoln Memorial, not the Capitol, which contradicts the claim made in the post.", "The second aspect involves examining the central claim of the post": "The expert confirms that the claim is valid, stating that during the Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020, police used riot control tactics to dominate the crowd. In contrast, during the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, law enforcement was filmed treating the pro-Trump mob with relative restraint. This comparison supports the overall message of the post.", "The third aspect focuses on the factual error found in the post": "The expert points out that the first photo depicting rows of National Guard troops was taken at the Lincoln Memorial, not the Capitol. This factual inaccuracy undermines the credibility of the post but does not negate the central thrust of the message.", "The fourth aspect involves examining the documented differences in the way law enforcement handled the Black Lives Matter protests and the Capitol insurrection": "The expert highlights that during the protests, police deployed harsh riot control tactics on peaceful protesters, using shields, chemical irritants, and rubber bullets. However, during the storming of the Capitol, law enforcement displayed relative restraint, assisting rioters and even taking selfies with insurrectionists. This comparison further supports the claim made in the post."}
