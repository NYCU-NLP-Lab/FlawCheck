{"Coulter": "s claim is based on a Pew Research Center analysis of census data, which reported that about 33.5 million people of Mexican origin lived in the United States in 2011.", "Coulter argues that since Mexico has about 120 million people": "and one-quarter of that is 30 million, therefore, America has \"taken in\" one-quarter of Mexico's total population.", "However": "the Pew report counted the number of people who trace their roots back to Mexico, not people who directly came from the country. This means that the claim does not accurately represent the number of Mexicans who have immigrated to the United States.", "Additionally": "the claim fails to consider that about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States and were never part of Mexico's population. Therefore, they cannot be counted as part of the population that America has \"taken in.\""}
