{"The alleged quote attributed to Ravish Kumar was investigated and found to be fake": "Ravish Kumar himself denied making the statement and clarified that it had been shared in his name without his consent.", "The claim was widely shared on social media platforms": "particularly Facebook groups, where it gained traction and received several likes and shares. This indicates that a section of social media users believed the statement to be true.", "The lack of coverage by mainstream media regarding Ravish Kumar": "s supposed controversial statement adds to the evidence that it is not authentic. If such a statement had been made by Kumar, it would have likely been reported by reputable news sources.", "The context surrounding the claim": "which involved the Murshidabad triple murder case, was examined. The investigation into the case revealed that the accused was not motivated by religious reasons but rather a monetary dispute. This further discredits the claim attributed to Ravish Kumar, as it does not align with the facts of the case."}
