{"The claim made by Bernie Sanders is that": "80 percent of poor people did not vote\" in the 2014 election.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that while the data from the Census Bureau shows that only one in four individuals earning less than $10,000 voted in 2014, the poverty threshold also includes family incomes above $10,000. Therefore, the expert suggests looking at annual incomes under $30,000 instead, where the turnout rate was 31.5 percent.", "The expert also mentions that census data may overstate turnout rates as it relies on self": "reporting, so it is possible that Sanders' figure of 80 percent is closer to the actual rates than what the survey shows.", "The survey conducted found that just 20 percent of the least financially secure individuals were": "likely voters\" in 2014, compared to 69 percent of the most financially secure individuals. This indicates a significant disparity in voter turnout based on financial security."}
