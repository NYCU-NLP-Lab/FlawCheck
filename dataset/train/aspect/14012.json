{"The claim made by Rep": "Mark Meadows that the citizenship question was not included in the 2010 census is incorrect. The U.S. Census Bureau's history shows that a citizenship question has been asked in various forms since 1820, with the exception of the 1960 census.", "The citizenship question was not asked to every household in the 1950 census": "Census workers only asked about citizenship as a follow-up question to households that reported someone being born outside the United States.", "The Census Bureau started distributing two different questionnaires in 1970": "a short form sent to most households and a long form sent to a smaller sample. The long form included a question about citizenship, while the short form did not.", "The claim that President Obama decided not to include a citizenship question on the census is misleading": "While it is true that the question was not included in the 2010 census, it had been asked in previous censuses and was not solely a decision made by the Obama administration."}
