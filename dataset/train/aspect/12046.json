{"The quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson about the right to bear arms is a combination of different phrases from different sources": "The expert's verdict highlights that while a portion of the quote originated with Jefferson, it has been attached to a phrase that cannot be directly linked to him.", "The phrase": "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms\" is found in a draft of a proposed Virginia constitution in 1776. However, subsequent drafts included a qualifier that limited the use of arms to within one's own lands or tenements. This sentence did not make it into the final version of the Virginia state constitution.", "The sentence": "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government\" appears to be a modern augmentation. It was first published in a 1989 pro-Second Amendment newspaper column by Charlie Reese and cannot be found among Jefferson's recorded writings, letters, or speeches.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that the sentence often seen paired with the previous one does not appear in the Virginia Constitution drafts or any other known writings by Thomas Jefferson. This further supports the conclusion that the quote is not authentic."}
