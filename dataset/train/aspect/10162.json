{"The claim is made by Sen": "Kirsten Gillibrand at a conference hosted by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy and advocacy organization.", "The claim is based on a 2016 report from the Center for American Progress": "which found that people who take unpaid or partially paid leave lose $20.6 billion in wages each year.", "The report does not include the cost of a national paid leave program": "as it was intentional to wait for a consensus on what the program should look like before determining the cost to taxpayers.", "The director of labor market policy from American Action Forum": "Ben Gitis, highlights that the report does not say that including paid family leave would increase the economy by $21 billion, but rather that it would give workers $21 billion more, emphasizing the distinction."}
