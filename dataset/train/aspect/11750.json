{"The claim made by Republican Sen": "Rand Paul suggests that there were four \"data dumps\" in four states that occurred between 1:34-6:31 AM, which he implies could be a statistical anomaly or fraud.", "The expert": "s verdict states that there is no evidence to support the suggestion that these \"data dumps\" reflect fraud in the presidential election.", "Election officials had already warned before Election Day that complete": "unofficial results from all jurisdictions would not be available on Election Night due to the high number of absentee ballots and the time it takes to process them.", "The analysis that Paul relied on focused on four updates in three states": "Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia. The analysis did not support the claim of four \"data dumps\" in four states as stated in Paul's tweet. Additionally, absentee or mail-in ballots received by the time polls closed on November 3 were legally allowed to be counted in these states."}
