{"The claim originated from social media posts that were widely shared in April 2018": "suggesting that Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress had voted on a bill to end all child support in the U.S. by 11 June 2018.", "These posts were identified as variants of a similar hoax from September 2017": "which was created using the prank generator React365. The hoax claimed that President Trump and Congress had already ended all child support payments as of 2018.", "The content of the posts was traced back to React365": "a prank generator that allows users to generate fake news and share it on social media.
