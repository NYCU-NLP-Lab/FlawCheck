{"The claim is based on a scientific paper published in the journal Nature titled": "Mapping Tree Density at a Global Scale,\" which estimated the number of trees on Earth to be approximately 3.04 trillion. The paper used 428,775 actual field measurements and mathematical models to extrapolate the data to a global scale.", "NASA education and outreach specialist Maggie Masetti states that most estimates put the number of stars in the Milky Way between 100 billion and 400 billion": "However, there are different models and higher numbers have also been suggested.", "Estimating the number of trees on Earth and stars in the Milky Way is extremely difficult and comes with caveats and limitations": "These numbers are impossible to verify accurately due to the vastness of both the Earth and the galaxy.", "The claim is considered accurate insofar as the estimates approximate the actual numbers": "The 2015 estimate for the number of trees is an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate, while the number of stars in the Milky Way is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the average mass of a star and the galaxy's mass."}
