{"The claim is based on a statement made by Nan Rich": "a Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, during a Florida Press Association event. Rich expressed her belief that Florida's tax system is regressive and cited studies that suggest it is the \"third most-regressive tax base.\"", "Rich referred to a 2013 report by The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy": "which partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, a group advocating for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. The report concluded that all states have regressive tax systems, with taxes disproportionately burdening the poor and middle class compared to the wealthy.", "The report specifically analyzed property": "sales, and excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes paid by different income groups in each state in 2013. It ranked Florida as the \"No. 2 of the terrible 10,\" indicating it had the second most-regressive tax system in the country, with Washington state being ranked first.", "The executive director of The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy": "Matt Gardner, highlighted two factors that contribute to a very unfair tax system: the absence of a personal income tax and an above-average sales tax. He stated that Florida lacks a personal income tax and has a high reliance on consumption taxes, which exacerbates the regressivity of its tax structure."}
