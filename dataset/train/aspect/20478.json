{"Analysis of the tax plan": "The expert likely examined the details of Tommy Thompson's tax plan to determine if it indeed included provisions for an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent. This would involve studying the specific tax rates, exemptions, and deductions outlined in the plan.", "Comparison with existing tax rates": "The expert may have compared the proposed tax cuts in Thompson's plan with the current tax rates in order to assess the accuracy of the claim. This would involve analyzing the percentage of income taxes paid by the top 1 percent under the existing tax system and determining if Thompson's plan would significantly reduce their tax burden.", "Verification of income and tax data": "To verify the claim, the expert might have examined the income and tax data for the top 1 percent of earners in 2009, as mentioned in the analysis. This would involve reviewing official sources such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ensure the accuracy of the figures used in the calculation.", "Evaluation of campaign statements": "The expert may have also considered the statements made by both Tammy Baldwin and Tommy Thompson's campaign spokespeople regarding the tax plan. This would involve analyzing the arguments presented by each side and assessing the credibility and evidence provided to support their claims."}
