{"Assembly bill vote": "One aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the fact that Marc Molinaro voted against a bill in 2009 that aimed to prohibit the use of shackles and restraints on pregnant inmates during childbirth. This information was obtained from the Assembly records.", "Testimonies and expert opinions": "The expert's verdict mentions that women who had been incarcerated in New York State described their experiences of being subjected to the use of waist chains, handcuffs, and shackles during labor. Health care organizations, such as the Medical Society of the State of New York and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also expressed their concerns about the physical and emotional harm caused by restraining pregnant inmates during childbirth.", "Legislative support and passage": "The expert's verdict states that the bill to prohibit the use of restraints on pregnant inmates during childbirth received wide support, passing with unanimous votes in the Senate (61-0) and Assembly (119-21). This legislative support indicates the recognition of the need to protect the rights and well-being of pregnant inmates during labor and delivery.", "Legal provisions and restrictions": "The expert's verdict explains the provisions of the law that was enacted, which restricts the use of restraints on pregnant inmates during transportation to a hospital, labor, delivery, and recovery. The law allows for restraints only in \"extraordinary circumstances\" and specifies that no restraints should be used during labor or recovery. This information confirms that there are legal restrictions in place to prevent the shackling of female inmates during childbirth."}
