{"The timing of the migrant caravan": "The expert's verdict mentions that the migrant caravan from Honduras began its journey before President Biden took office, indicating that the timing of the caravan was not directly influenced by his changes to immigration policies.", "Statements from caravan members": "According to the expert's verdict, some members of the caravan expressed their reasons for making the trip, citing the Biden administration's approach to immigration as a motivating factor. This suggests that at least some individuals in the caravan believed that Biden's policies would make it easier for them to reach the U.S. border.", "Dissipation of the caravan": "The expert's verdict states that by January 20, when Biden took office and signed executive orders related to immigration, the caravan had reportedly dissipated. This indicates that the caravan's journey was not solely driven by the expectation of favorable changes in immigration policies under the new administration.", "Lack of evidence regarding impact": "The expert's verdict mentions that there was no evidence to suggest that Biden's actions would have directly impacted the caravan's experience at the U.S.-Mexico border. This suggests that the claim linking the caravan to Biden's immigration policies may lack sufficient evidence or justification."}
