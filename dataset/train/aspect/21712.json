{"The claim alleges that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish": "spent federal stimulus funds on campaign Christmas cards.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of this claim is the investigation conducted by the New Mexico Watchdog, a blog sponsored by the libertarian Rio Grande Foundation. The blog alleged that Denish used federal funds to pay for various services, including a contractor to take Christmas pictures and write Christmas cards.", "The second aspect involves the confirmation of the expenditures by documents from Denish herself": "The expert's verdict mentions that the blog's allegations were supported by documents provided by Denish, which confirmed the use of federal stimulus funds for various projects, including the Christmas cards.", "The third aspect is the mention of the specific bill from which the stimulus funds were obtained": "The expert's verdict clarifies that the funds in question were not from the bill signed by President Barack Obama in 2009 but rather from a 2003 bill signed by President George W. Bush. This detail helps to provide context and accuracy to the claim.", "The fourth aspect involves the invoice filed by contractor Lauran Cowdrey": "who was paid using the excess federal funds. The invoice detailed the hours worked on various tasks, including taking Christmas pictures, removing decorations, setting up pre-K interviews, and working on the Christmas card. This invoice serves as additional evidence supporting the claim that federal funds were indeed used for campaign Christmas cards."}
