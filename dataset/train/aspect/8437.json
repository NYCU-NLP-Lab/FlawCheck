{"The date discrepancy": "The expert's verdict states that the video in question was taken on Jan. 6, 2020, not Jan. 6, 2021, as claimed. This inconsistency in the date raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Location mismatch": "The expert's verdict reveals that the video was actually taken in Michigan, not in Washington, D.C. as claimed. This contradiction in the location further questions the veracity of the claim.", "Contextual information": "The expert's verdict provides details about the events that took place on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. This information helps to establish the background and highlights the chaotic scene that occurred, which is unrelated to the claim of the video showing a cross being erected.", "Additional evidence": "The expert's verdict references a video posted by a reporter with the Lansing State Journal, which shows the same cross being erected outside the Capitol in Michigan. This additional evidence supports the conclusion that the video in question is indeed from a separate protest in Michigan and not related to the events at the U.S. Capitol."}
