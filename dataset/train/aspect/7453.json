{"The claim was verified by examining the state statutes": "specifically Section 9.10 of the recall law, which listed eight ways a signature could be nullified, but did not mention anything about multiple signatures.", "The expert found a specific provision in the statute that stated if a challenger can establish that a person signed the recall petition more than once": "the 2nd and subsequent signatures may not be counted. This means that duplicates can be thrown out, but the first signature is still valid.", "The Government Accountability Board": "which oversees elections and the recall process, does not have the resources to systematically check for duplicates in the petitions. The responsibility to challenge the validity of signatures falls on the incumbent or the gatherers.", "While there are no legal restrictions or penalties for signing a petition more than once": "it was noted that doing so could falsely inflate the true number of signatures and potentially jeopardize the cause. The Government Accountability Board does not encourage multiple signatures, but acknowledged that there could be instances where it may be justified."}
