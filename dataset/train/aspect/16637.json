{"Lack of verifiable details": "The expert mentions that there are no details documenting the identity of the pictured child, its birth weight, or the date and circumstances of its birth. This lack of specific information raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent weights": "The expert notes that the photograph has been online since at least 2017, with varying weights offered for the pictured child. This inconsistency in reported weights adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Comparison to existing Guinness World Record": "The expert mentions that the current Guinness World Record for \"Heaviest Birth\" is a 9.98 kg (22 lb.) baby born in 1879. By comparing this record to the claimed weight of the newborn in the photograph, it becomes apparent that the claim may not be accurate.", "Alternative news accounts": "The expert refers to news accounts of a 2009 birth in Indonesia where a baby weighing 8.7 kg (19.2 lbs) was born. This provides an alternative example of a newborn with a weight greater than the one claimed in the photograph, suggesting that such occurrences are not unprecedented."}
