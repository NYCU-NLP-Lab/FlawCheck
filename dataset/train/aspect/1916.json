{"The claim is contradicted by medical experts": "The expert's verdict states that the viral Facebook post claiming that the nasal swab test for COVID-19 damages the blood-brain barrier and can lead to brain infections is false. Medical experts, including Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of epidemiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, have stated that this claim is not true.", "The testing procedure is described": "The expert's verdict provides a detailed description of the testing procedure, explaining that a nasopharyngeal or nasal swab is used to collect cells and fluids from the upper respiratory system. The swab is inserted into the cavity between the nose and mouth for 15 seconds and rotated several times before being sent to a lab for testing.", "The safety of the swab test is emphasized": "Dr. Shawn Nasseri, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, confirms the safety of the nasal swab test. He states that the biggest risk is discomfort and that it is estimated that close to 40 million or more swabs have been performed safely in the U.S. alone.", "Lack of evidence supporting the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim made in the viral Facebook post has no basis in reality. Dr. Maldonado consulted with neurosurgeons, neurologists, and other physicians who have not heard of such a situation occurring or being likely. This lack of evidence further supports the conclusion that the claim is false."}
