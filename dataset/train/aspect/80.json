This aspect verifies that Clinton's support for a barrier was not equivalent to the type of wall Trump wants.", "Differences between a wall and a fence": "The expert's verdict highlights the differences between a wall and a fence in terms of their extent, solidity, and effectiveness in blocking people. While Clinton's support for a fence can be considered as supporting a barrier, it is emphasized that the fence is not as extensive or effective as the wall Trump is advocating. This aspect verifies that there are significant differences between the two structures.", "Associated Press report": "The expert's verdict mentions a report by the Associated Press stating that the fencing authorized by the Secure Fence Act has miles-long gaps, gates for landowner access, and has been easily bypassed by immigrants. This aspect verifies that the fencing supported by Clinton was not as secure or impenetrable as the wall Trump envisions."}
