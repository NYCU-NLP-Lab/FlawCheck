The paper used World Health Organization statistics on female murder rates from 1994 to 1999.", "Discrepancy in homicide rates": "The expert compared the rates of gun homicides with all homicides and found a difference. While the United States had the highest rate for gun homicides, it was not as far ahead when considering all homicides.

They also mentioned a newer study from 2015 that found the U.S. homicide rate was 7 times higher than other high-income countries combined."}
