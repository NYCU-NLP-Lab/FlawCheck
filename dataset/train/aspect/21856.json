{"The difference between penalty charge notices and parking charge notices": "The expert's verdict highlights that penalty charge notices are usually issued by the police or councils for breaching parking rules on public land or breaking certain traffic rules. On the other hand, parking charge notices are invoices issued by private companies for breaking parking conditions in a private car park.", "Advice on ignoring parking charge notices": "The expert's verdict states that the claim advises people to ignore parking charge notices. However, it clarifies that ignoring them completely may not be the best approach. If individuals want to appeal the notice, they should not pay immediately and follow guidance on appeals provided by Citizens Advice. But if there are no grounds for appeal, it is recommended to pay.", "Discrediting Martin Lewis as the source of the advice": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim implies that Martin Lewis, the founder of Money Saving Expert, recommends ignoring parking charge notices. However, it clarifies that Martin Lewis has stated that he does not recommend this approach. This discredits the claim's association with Martin Lewis.", "Lack of context in the advice": "The expert's verdict highlights that while the claim accurately describes the difference between penalty charge notices and parking charge notices, the advice to simply ignore tickets issued by private companies needs more context. This suggests that the claim's advice may not be comprehensive or fully accurate."}
