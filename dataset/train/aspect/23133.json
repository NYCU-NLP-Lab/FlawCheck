{"The claim made by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos that": "1 in 4 Wisconsin schools had a subpar score on the Department of Public Instruction\u2019s recent report cards\" was verified by examining the actual report cards produced by a bipartisan task force, which included teachers, school leaders, researchers, advocates, and legislators from both parties.", "The report cards used a rating scale to assess the performance of schools": "with different categories indicating different levels of performance. The categories included \"Significantly Exceeds Expectations,\" \"Exceeds Expectations,\" \"Meets Expectations,\" \"Meets Few Expectations,\" and \"Fails to Meet Expectations.\" The percentage of schools falling into each category was analyzed to determine if the claim about 1 in 4 schools failing was accurate.", "An Associated Press story from October 2012 described the results of the report cards": "stating that \"Most Wisconsin schools meet or exceed expectations as defined on new, more stringent report cards.\" This information was used to provide context and additional evidence to verify or refute the claim.", "The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also reported on the report cards": "stating that 86 percent of schools rated met or exceeded the state's expectations for performance. This information was considered as another source to assess the accuracy of the claim made by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos."}
