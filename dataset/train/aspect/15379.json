{"The source of the information": "The expert checked the source of the claim and found that it was based on a report published by the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute. This indicates that the claim is backed by a reputable organization.", "Comparison with official data": "The expert compared the information from the report with data that school districts are required to submit annually to the state. The results were found to be very similar, suggesting that the claim is supported by official data.", "Validation by teacher groups": "The expert reached out to the state's major teacher groups, the Professional Association of Georgia Educators and the Georgia Association of Educators, who confirmed that the data developed by the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute and cited by the claim seemed credible. This adds further credibility to the authenticity of the claim.", "Consistency with other evidence": "The expert noted that the claim aligns with other evidence and statements made by politicians and education experts. The fact that school districts have had to reduce staff, increase class sizes, and shorten school years due to budget cuts supports the claim that there has been a loss of teachers in Georgia's public schools."}
