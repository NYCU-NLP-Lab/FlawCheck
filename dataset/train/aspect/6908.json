{"Launch and history of the Tiangong": "1: The expert's verdict provides information about the launch and purpose of the Tiangong-1 space station, including its missions and experiments conducted by astronauts.", "Loss of communication and control": "The Chinese government announced in March 2016 that they had lost the ability to communicate with the Tiangong-1. This information was later confirmed by professional researchers and amateur satellite trackers, indicating that China has no control over the station's re-entry.", "Orbital decay and re": "entry process: The expert explains that the Tiangong-1 is in a low-Earth orbit and experiences gradual drag from atmospheric gas molecules, causing its speed to decrease and altitude to lower. Without the ability to send commands for orbital corrections, the re-entry cannot be precisely controlled.", "Analysis by Aerospace Corporation": "The Aerospace Corporation, a research and development center supporting the US government, performed their own analysis of the Tiangong-1's orbit. They estimated that the space station would reenter the atmosphere in mid-March 2018, with a possibility of some debris surviving and potentially impacting the Earth's surface."}
