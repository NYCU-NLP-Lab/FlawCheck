{"The report by Robert Balfanz": "The expert's verdict mentions a report by Robert Balfanz, co-director of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University, which classified 1,999 high schools as \"low performing\" based on 2006 data. This report provided the initial evidence for the claim that roughly 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States produce about half of the nation's dropouts.", "Updated research": "The expert's verdict mentions that Balfanz re-examined the issue in a 2010 report titled \"Building a Grad Nation,\" which used U.S. Department of Education figures. This updated research found that the number of worst-performing schools had fallen from 2,007 in 2002 to 1,746 in 2008, and further decreased to 1,634 in 2009. This updated information supports the claim that a small percentage of high schools still produce a significant number of dropouts.", "America": "s Promise Alliance: The expert's verdict mentions the America's Promise Alliance, a non-profit group co-founded by retired Army General and Secretary of State Colin Powell. This organization co-sponsored the \"Building a Grad Nation\" study and has proposed a \"Civic Marshall Plan\" to increase high school completion rates. Their involvement adds credibility to the claim and the research conducted by Balfanz.", "Dropout rates among different demographics": "The expert's verdict highlights the statistics provided by Balfanz's report, which indicate that an even greater share of minority dropouts come from the identified low-performing schools. Specifically, 81 percent of Native American dropouts, 73 percent of African-American dropouts, and 66 percent of Latino dropouts attended these schools. This aspect further supports the claim that a small percentage of high schools have a disproportionate impact on the nation's dropout problem."}
