{"Lack of mandate for criminal background checks": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no requirement in the Obamacare law for navigators to undergo criminal background checks. This aspect suggests that convicted felons, including those involved in identity theft or fraud, could potentially be involved in assisting individuals with health coverage.", "Access to personally identifiable information": "The expert's verdict mentions that navigators may have access to applicants' personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, date of birth, address, phone number, and annual income. This aspect raises concerns about the potential risk of identity theft or financial loss if individuals with criminal backgrounds have access to such sensitive information.", "Unbiased and free services": "The government states that navigators are required to be unbiased and that their services are free to consumers. This aspect emphasizes the importance of impartiality in assisting individuals with health coverage and suggests that the lack of screening for convicted felons may undermine the integrity of the program.", "Establishment of standards and collaboration with states": "The Obamacare law mandates the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services to establish standards for navigators, ensuring their qualifications, licensing if necessary, and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Additionally, the law requires collaboration with states to develop standards that ensure the information provided by navigators is fair, accurate, and impartial. These aspects highlight the efforts made to regulate and monitor the activities of navigators, but they do not specifically address the issue of criminal background checks."}
