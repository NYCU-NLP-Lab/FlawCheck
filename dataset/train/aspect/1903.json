{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that none of the online sites provided any evidence to support the claim that the U.S. government had purchased 30,000 guillotines. The absence of documented proof regarding the Congressional approval or the actual acquisition of the instruments questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Originating from unreliable sources": "The claim originated from a blog known for promoting anti-Muslim articles and conspiracy rumors. This indicates that the source itself is not credible and raises doubts about the veracity of the information being circulated.", "Historical recurrence of similar rumors": "The expert's verdict mentions that rumors about the U.S. government stockpiling guillotines have been circulating since at least the George W. Bush administration in 2008. This pattern suggests that these rumors are not based on factual information but rather a recurring conspiracy theory.", "Inaccurate portrayal and misleading imagery": "The expert's verdict mentions that one outbreak of the rumor was accompanied by an illustration of a satirical \"Chanel guillotine\" sculpture by artist Tom Sachs, rather than an actual guillotine. This misleading imagery further questions the credibility of the claim and highlights the tendency to manipulate information to support the conspiracy theory."}
