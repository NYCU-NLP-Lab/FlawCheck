{"Testimony of JoBeth Williams": "JoBeth Williams, the actress who played Diane Freeling in the movie, stated in an interview that she believed the skeletons used in the film were plastic but later found out they were real. Her firsthand account adds credibility to the claim.", "Confirmation from Bruce Kasson": "Bruce Kasson, identified as the film's assistant prop master, supported Williams' account by stating that the skeletons used in the movie were purchased from Carolina Biological, a medical and science supply company. Kasson's confirmation provides additional evidence to support the claim.", "Lack of denial from production companies": "The fact that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Brothers Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment did not confirm or deny the claim when contacted suggests that there may be some truth to it. Their silence on the matter adds weight to the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of replica skeletons at the time": "Kasson mentioned that replica skeletons were not common or readily available during the time of the movie's production. This indicates that using real skeletons may have been a more practical and cost-effective option. The lack of alternative options further supports the claim."}
