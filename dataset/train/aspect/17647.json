{"The claim was initially circulated through a side": "by-side image comparison shared on the Facebook page \"World of Wonder Productions,\" which showed Kellyanne Conway's Gucci jacket alongside a vintage Simplicity pattern packet that appeared to have a similar design.", "The authenticity of the claim was quickly debunked as a fake by pattern collectors": "sites and shops. They pointed out that the circulated image of the Simplicity pattern (numbered 6554 and issued in 1974) differed in appearance from the Gucci jacket worn by Conway.", "Multiple unaltered units of the genuine Simplicity 6554 pattern were found available for sale on Etsy": "further confirming that it did not closely resemble Conway's Gucci ensemble.", "The original form of the Simplicity pattern": "as seen on pattern collectors' sites and shops, did not bear any resemblance to the Gucci jacket worn by Conway during the inauguration. This confirmed that the claim of the ensemble resembling a 1970s Simplicity pattern was false."}
