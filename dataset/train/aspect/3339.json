{"Wayne LaPierre distorted the facts when discussing the federal system for conducting background checks on prospective gun buyers": "2. LaPierre inaccurately described a rescinded Obama-era rule regarding the Social Security Administration reporting mentally disabled beneficiaries to the federal database used for gun background checks.", "LaPierre falsely claimed that the rule banned Social Security recipients who granted financial authority to others from purchasing firearms": "when in reality, the rule had specific criteria and allowed affected individuals to petition for the ability to obtain a gun if they posed no threat.", "LaPierre misleadingly stated that the NRA": "originated\" the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for gun sales, when in fact, the NRA proposed instant background checks as an alternative to a mandatory waiting period and later opposed expanding background checks."}
