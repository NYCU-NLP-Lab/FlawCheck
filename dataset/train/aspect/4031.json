{"The claim is supported by a statement made by U": "S. Senator Bob Corker, who voted against a short-term budget measure and argued that no budget had been passed in over three years and no appropriations bill had been brought to the floor this year.", "Corker": "s claim is backed up by two documents compiled by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee. The first document is a timeline indicating that the last time the Democratic-led Senate passed a budget was on April 29, 2009. The second document is a status report on all 12 of the annual spending bills, which states that none of the bills have been considered by the full Senate this year.", "The fact": "checking organization PolitiFact has examined similar claims in the past and has given rulings of True or Mostly True when blame was not solely placed on one political party. In this case, Corker's statement does not solely blame one party, and the date of April 29, 2009, is consistent with previous claims about the lack of budget approval.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that Congress approved a short-term budget measure before going on a pre-election break, which further supports Corker's claim that a full budget had not been passed."}
