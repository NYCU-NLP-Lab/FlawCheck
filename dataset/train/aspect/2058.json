This comparison helped verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis from the Federation of Tax Administrators": "The expert referred to a 2013 analysis from the Federation of Tax Administrators, a nonpartisan group that serves the principal tax collection agencies in all 50 states. This analysis also used data from the U.S. Census and found that the taxes Florida collected per capita were $1,769, which is close to the number cited by Gov. Rick Scott.", "Verification through the Kaiser Family Foundation": "The expert mentioned that the Kaiser Family Foundation, another nonpartisan organization, also cited the same figure of $1,769 for taxes collected per capita in Florida. This further supported the claim made by Gov. Rick Scott.", "Consideration of the per capita figure": "The expert explained that while the per capita figure includes individuals who may not pay taxes or pay only a nominal amount, it is still a useful tool for comparing tax burdens across state lines. This aspect was taken into account to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the claim's authenticity."}
