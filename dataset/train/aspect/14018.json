{"Lack of response from Governor Abbott": "s office: The fact that Governor Abbott's office did not respond to the fact-checkers' request for backup information raises questions about the authenticity of the claim. This lack of response suggests that the governor may not have reliable evidence to support his statement.", "Comparison with previous data": "The fact-checkers examined the historical data on Texas unemployment rates and found that the 4 percent rate claimed by Governor Abbott for September 2017 was not the lowest in 40 years. They discovered that the state had the same 4 percent rate in November and December 2000, 17 years ago. This comparison undermines the accuracy of the governor's claim.", "Confirmation from experts": "The fact-checkers consulted experts in the field, including a Dallas-based economist from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Cheryl Abbot, and Mark J. Perry, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint. Both experts agreed that Governor Abbott's claim was an overstatement and that Texas did not lead the nation in job gains for September 2017.", "Comparison with national data": "The fact-checkers referenced a press release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which stated that Texas was not among the top five states with job gains from August to September 2017. This contradicts Governor Abbott's claim that Texas led the nation in new job creation. This comparison with national data further calls into question the authenticity of the claim."}
