{"The claim was based on a headline from the website Weekly Observer": "which is based in England, and was also reported on at least two other websites. This indicates that multiple sources were reporting on the claim.", "The claim was supported by a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine": "The study tracked the development of a fetus whose mother contracted the Zika virus while she was 3 months pregnant. The study used blood tests and MRIs to monitor the fetus and observed the baby's brain being \"liquefied\" over a course of nine weeks.", "Ultrasound examinations conducted up until the 17th week of the pregnancy showed no abnormalities": "However, by the 19th week, basic structures in the fetus's cranium were not as they should be, indicating a change in the fetus's condition.", "The claim was refuted by the lead authors of the New England Journal of Medicine study": "They stated that the claim of the brain being \"liquefied\" was a false interpretation and not what they had said. Another author suggested that a reporter may have misunderstood him during an interview. This indicates that there may have been some miscommunication or misinterpretation of the study's findings."}
