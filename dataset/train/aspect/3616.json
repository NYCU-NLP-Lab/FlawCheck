{"Reduction in murders": "The expert's analysis revealed that while Michael Bloomberg claimed to have reduced murders in New York City by 50%, the data showed that murders had already been declining before he took office and continued to do so after he left. The expert's investigation questioned the extent to which Bloomberg's policies contributed to the reduction in murders.", "Historic lows in police shootings": "Bloomberg boasted about reducing police shootings to historic lows in his speech. The expert's evaluation included the data provided by Bloomberg's campaign, which cited the lowest number of shots fired by officers and shooting incidents recorded since 1971. However, further analysis may be needed to determine the specific impact of Bloomberg's policies on reducing police shootings.", "Decrease in incarceration rates": "The expert's examination acknowledged Bloomberg's claim of reducing the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%. While Bloomberg's campaign cited data to support this claim, the expert's verdict did not provide specific details on the authenticity of the data or the factors contributing to the decrease in incarceration rates.", "Comparison with other cities": "Bloomberg's declaration that \"no other city in America did what we did\" was a significant aspect evaluated by the expert. The verdict did not explicitly state whether this claim was verified or debunked, but it highlighted the existence of data suggesting that other cities had also experienced reductions in crime rates during similar periods. The expert's analysis may have considered the comparative context to assess the uniqueness of New York City's achievements under Bloomberg's leadership."}
