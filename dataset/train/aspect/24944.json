{"Inconsistent sourcing": "The claim attributes the warning to a National Health Service (NHS) worker in the UK, but there are variations of the message that claim different sources, such as the University of California, Davis. This inconsistency raises doubts about the veracity of the claim.", "Lack of universal peak date": "The claim states that the peak of COVID-19 infections will hit between March 27 and April 7, but there is no universally reported peak date. Different regions experience peak caseloads at different times, depending on various factors. This inconsistency suggests that the claim may not be accurate.", "Contradiction with official advice": "Public health leaders, including the NHS, have instructed people to stay at home and practice social distancing to slow the spread of the virus. The NHS advises that essential trips out of the home should be minimized, but the claim warns against going out to buy necessities. This contradiction with official advice raises doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of supporting evidence": "The claim does not provide any evidence or specific details to support the warning given by the supposed NHS worker. Without any supporting evidence, it becomes difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
