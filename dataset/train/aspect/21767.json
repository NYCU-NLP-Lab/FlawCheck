{"Verification through independent website": "The expert used OpenSecrets.org, an independent website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, to track campaign contributions of at least $200 in congressional and other elections. This website provided the breakdown of contributions to Scott Brown's campaign and confirmed the specific number cited in the claim.", "Comparison with claim in attack ad": "The expert compared the claim made in the attack ad by the Shaheen campaign, which stated \"Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,\" with the actual campaign contributions received by Brown. This comparison helped verify the accuracy of the claim.", "Updated figures": "The expert mentioned that the initial claim made in the ad was a little out of date. The expert provided updated figures that showed Brown had received $488,010 from donors associated with the oil and gas industry. This ensured the accuracy and relevance of the information.", "Identification of donor sectors": "The expert highlighted that while the claim referred to \"Big Oil,\" the donations from the oil and gas industry were not solely from large corporations. The expert noted that the sector ranked 14th in terms of donations to Brown, with retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, and real estate being the biggest sectors contributing to his campaign. This clarification added context to the claim and provided a more comprehensive understanding of the campaign contributions."}
