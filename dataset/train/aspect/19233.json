{"The comparison of California": "s prisons budget in 1970 and the present: The expert's verdict highlights that Governor Jerry Brown claimed that the corrections budget in 1970 was about 3 percent of the general fund, while it is now 8.9 percent, approximately $12 billion. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim by comparing the two time periods.", "Supporting evidence from California": "s fiscal year budgets: The expert mentions that the 1970-71 fiscal year budget supports the first part of Brown's claim, stating that the corrections department accounted for 2.8 percent of the general fund budget. Additionally, Brown's 2018-19 budget proposal also aligns with the claim, showing an expected expenditure of 9 percent on the corrections department. These budget documents provide concrete evidence to verify the claim.", "Confirmation from a criminal justice professor": "The expert cites Franklin Zimring, a UC Berkeley criminal justice professor, who supports Brown's claim by stating that the increased share of prison spending is \"absolutely true.\" Zimring attributes this increase to factors such as the state's booming population, tough sentencing laws, and the national focus on drug crimes. This expert opinion further strengthens the authenticity of the claim.", "Reduction in prison population but rising corrections spending": "The expert mentions that California has significantly reduced its prison population following a Supreme Court order, but the state's corrections spending has continued to rise. This aspect verifies the claim by illustrating that even with fewer inmates, the budget allocated to the corrections department has increased."}
