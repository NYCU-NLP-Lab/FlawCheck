{"Discrepancy in location": "The expert's verdict highlights that the incident took place in Vapi town of Valsad district, Gujarat, and not in Surat as claimed. This indicates a clear discrepancy in the location of the incident, which raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Multiple mainstream media coverage": "The incident was covered by several mainstream media outlets, including India Today, The Times of India, and The Indian Express. The fact that these reputable news sources reported on the incident adds credibility to the information and suggests that it is more likely to be true.", "Police investigation findings": "The preliminary investigation conducted by the police revealed that Piyush Pachhigar had allegedly stolen jewelry from a shop in Vapi. This information contradicts the claim of financial crisis as the motive for suicide, providing evidence that the claim is not authentic.", "Eyewitness statement": "A Vapi police officer stated that Pachhigar committed suicide after the jeweler came to know about his presence and tried to recover the stolen jewelry. This statement from an eyewitness adds further weight to the police investigation findings and undermines the claim of financial crisis as the reason for suicide."}
