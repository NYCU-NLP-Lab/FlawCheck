{"Lack of credible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no credible evidence linking the noise from wind turbines to cancer. The American Cancer Society also confirmed this, stating that they are unaware of any such evidence.", "Genetic basis of cancer": "The expert explains that cancer is primarily a genetic disease caused by mutations in DNA. There is no specific reason to believe that wind turbines can cause these mutations or contribute to the development of cancer.", "Environmental exposures as cancer causes": "The expert mentions that environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, pollution, or ultraviolet light, are typically the factors associated with cancer causes. Sound waves, which are emitted by wind turbines, are not known to directly impact DNA or cause cancer.", "Positive effects of sound waves": "The expert mentions that sound waves, including those emitted by wind turbines, have been found to help diagnose cancer and potentially even fight off the disease. This suggests that sound waves from wind turbines may have beneficial effects rather than being harmful."}
