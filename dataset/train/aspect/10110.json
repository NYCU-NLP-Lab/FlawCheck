{"The expert references a General Accounting Office": "GAO) report released in March 2011 that identified 34 areas where federal welfare programs have similar or overlapping objectives or provide similar services. This report serves as a basis for evaluating the claim about the effectiveness of federal food assistance programs.", "The expert highlights Rep": "Jim Jordan's statement that \"only seven of 18 federal food assistance programs have been associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes, while the remaining 11 have not been effective.\" This statement by a political figure adds weight to the claim but requires verification.", "The expert mentions that the GAO report found signs of overlap and inefficient use of resources in the system of federal food and nutrition assistance programs": "This suggests that there may be duplication and wasteful spending within these programs, which can impact their effectiveness.", "The expert includes Rep": "Dennis Kucinich's statement that the GAO did not find waste, fraud, and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs. While this statement doesn't directly address the effectiveness of the programs, it provides additional context and perspective on the claim."}
