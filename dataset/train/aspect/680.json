{"Lack of reliable data": "The expert points out that there is no single source of data to draw from when estimating the percentage of fabricated sexual assault allegations. This lack of reliable data makes it challenging to confidently determine the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and evolving methods": "The methods used by law enforcement agencies to determine the validity of a victim's allegations have been inconsistent and have evolved over time. This inconsistency has led to past estimates of false claims being overly high, highlighting the difficulty in accurately assessing the authenticity of rape allegations.", "Limited and flawed research": "The expert mentions that there is limited research on false rape allegations and unfounding decisions. The existing research also suffers from a number of limitations, including inappropriate or inconsistent definitions. This limitation in research further complicates the verification process.", "Lower percentage of false reports": "The expert cites multiple studies that estimate the percentage of false rape reports to be significantly lower than the claim of 99%. The studies indicate percentages ranging from 4.5% to 5.2%, suggesting that the claim is highly exaggerated and not supported by empirical evidence."}
