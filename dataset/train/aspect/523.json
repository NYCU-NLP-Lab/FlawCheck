{"Lack of official records": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is no record or evidence of the alleged abduction attempt happening in London, as confirmed by the London Police Service. This lack of official documentation raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradictory statements from authorities": "The general manager of the Masonville Mall, where the alleged incident was said to have taken place, stated that she was not aware of any abduction attempt on the premises. This contradiction between the claim and the statement from the mall's authority further questions the credibility of the story.", "Similar stories on social media": "The expert points out that nearly identical scenarios have been shared on social media in other cities over the past two years. None of these posts were written by someone present at the scene of the alleged abduction. This pattern suggests that the claim may be part of a recurring urban legend or hoax.", "Statistics on child abductions": "The available data on child abductions refutes the idea that strangers frequently attempt to kidnap children in public spaces. The expert mentions that the majority of child abductions are carried out by a child's relative. The low number of reported abductions by strangers in comparison to the total number of missing minors in 2018 further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
