{"The rumor of Muslim": "no-go zones\" in the United States, France, and Britain has been circulating since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, but gained increased attention and saturation after a controversial Fox News segment in January 2015.", "The claim was initially made by self": "styled terrorism expert Steve Emerson during the Fox News segment, where he asserted the existence of Muslim no-go zones in various western countries, including the U.S., England, and France. Emerson claimed that Sharia law overrode the local laws in these areas, and local police avoided intervening.", "The claim about Birmingham": "England being a Muslim-only city, made by Emerson during the Fox News segment, was widely criticized and debunked. British Prime Minister David Cameron called Emerson a \"complete idiot\" for his false statement and highlighted Birmingham as a city that brings people of different faiths and backgrounds together.", "Emerson later retracted his claims about Birmingham and issued an apology on his website": "This retraction came after a Twitter exchange with the French ambassador, where Emerson pressed for details on 750 rumored no-go zones in France."}
