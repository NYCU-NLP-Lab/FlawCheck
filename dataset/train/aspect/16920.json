{"The research projects analyzed existing studies": "The experts examined 54 already-existing studies, involving over 78,000 people, to draw their conclusions. This approach ensured a comprehensive analysis of the available data.", "The focus was on household transmission": "Contrary to the claim, the research primarily investigated how the virus spreads within households, rather than in public settings. This distinction is important in understanding the limitations of the studies and their relevance to the claim.", "The research did not directly address asymptomatic transmission": "The studies reviewed by the experts did not specifically examine the transmission of the virus by asymptomatic individuals. This finding contradicts the claim that presymptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients do not spread the virus in any setting.", "The research was misrepresented": "The experts highlighted that the research findings were widely misrepresented. The claim and related posts misinterpreted the research, leading to the incorrect assertion that social distancing measures and lockdown restrictions were unnecessary. This aspect emphasizes the importance of accurate interpretation and dissemination of scientific findings."}
