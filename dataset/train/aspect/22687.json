{"The expert relied on the statement made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor during a speech to the American Enterprise Institute": "where he claimed that the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years. This speech serves as the initial source of the claim.", "The expert consulted the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics": "BLS) for tenure data, which is collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. The BLS publishes tenure statistics every other year and provides information on how long workers have been with their current employers.", "The expert compared the median tenure figures from 1991 and 2012": "which were the closest years available for a 21-year comparison. In 1991, the median tenure for all workers was 4.6 years, while in 2012, it increased to 5.4 years. This comparison shows that the length of time employees stayed with companies actually increased, contradicting Cantor's claim.", "To provide a more accurate analysis": "the expert also considered the data specifically for workers aged 25 or older. In 1991, the median tenure for this age group was 4.8 years, and in 2012, it increased to 5.4 years. This further supports the finding that the length of time employees stayed with companies increased over the years."}
