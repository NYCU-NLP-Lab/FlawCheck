{"Reports from local officials": "The expert mentions that local officials in Indonesian regions such as Karawang, Belitung, and Jogjakarta have stated that they do not encounter the practice of boiling menstrual pads and drinking the liquid often. This suggests that the claim may not be as widespread or prevalent as initially reported.", "Historical documentation": "The expert points out that the practice of boiling sanitary pads to get \"high\" or \"drunk\" has been documented since at least 2016. This indicates that it is not a new trend but rather an activity that has been reported in the past.", "Sensationalist reporting": "The expert criticizes English-language news outlets for sensationalizing the claim and turning it into an \"alarming new trend\" to generate traffic-driven revenue. They argue that the reporting is based on a low number of incidents and exaggerates the significance of the practice.", "Limited sources": "The expert highlights that the stories about Indonesian teenagers using sanitary pads to get high generally reference the same individuals, such as a psychology lecturer specializing in drug abuse and addiction, a commissioner for drugs and health, and a spokesperson from the Indonesian National Drug Agency. This suggests that the information may be limited and potentially biased."}
