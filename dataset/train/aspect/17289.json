This aspect involves contrasting Rubio's claim with similar claims made by other politicians and assessing the specific elements that differentiate it.", "Comparison of unemployment rates": "The expert mentions that the Bureau of Labor Statistics data only goes back to 1948, making it impossible to analyze unemployment statistics from the years surrounding World War II.
