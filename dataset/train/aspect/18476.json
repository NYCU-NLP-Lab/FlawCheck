The claim is supported by evidence from a campaign ad released by Alan Grayson, which specifically mentions Webster's sponsorship of the bill.", "The claim is further reinforced by the fact that Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home": "which could be seen as limiting women's independence and perpetuating gender inequality.", "The claim is also connected to Grayson": "s previous ad that distorted Webster's words in a speech, suggesting that Webster's stance on women's issues may have been misrepresented."}
