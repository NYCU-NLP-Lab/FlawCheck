{"Property tax figures": "The expert examined property tax figures compiled by Dane County and the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group, to verify the claim that Kathleen Falk raised property taxes by \"millions of dollars every year\" and approved the second highest increase in the state in 2010.", "Falk": "s approach as executive: The expert considered Falk's approach as executive from 1997 to 2011, which aimed to limit increases in the property tax levy to inflation with a factor built in for population growth. This aspect provided context to understand Falk's overall approach to property taxes during her tenure.", "Compliance with self": "imposed levy limit: The expert confirmed that Falk's budget did raise property taxes by 8 percent in 2010, which was described as \"the second highest\" in the state. Falk exceeded her self-imposed levy limit of 1.19 percent for that year, citing the impact of the Great Recession and the need to preserve essential services.", "Corroboration of claims": "The expert cross-referenced the claims made by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch in her opinion piece, which accused Falk of raising taxes and being a tax-and-spend liberal. The expert found that Kleefisch's claims aligned with the verified property tax figures and Falk's approach to property taxes."}
