{"The CDC": "s running tally of deaths includes multiple causes for each death, but the single underlying cause is reflected in finalized year-end data issued the following year. This means that the number of deaths cited for a specific year may include cases where pneumonia is one of the causes listed on the death certificate, not just cases where pneumonia was the final underlying cause of death.", "Government officials have acknowledged that the national data on COVID": "19 deaths is likely an undercount. This suggests that the reported number of deaths from COVID-19 may be lower than the actual count.", "The COVID": "19 death toll has become a political issue, with Democratic politicians and groups suggesting on social media that government officials have misidentified COVID-19 deaths as pneumonia cases in an effort to conceal the true coronavirus death count. This political context raises questions about the motives behind the claim and the potential biases involved.", "The comparison between average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013": "2018 and the number of pneumonia deaths in 2020 may not be valid due to the way causes of death are coded in CDC data. If a death certificate mentions both COVID-19 and pneumonia, both codes are included in the CDC data for the current year, and the death will be allocated to both categories. This means that the increase in pneumonia deaths in 2020 could be attributed to cases where COVID-19 and pneumonia were both mentioned on the death certificate, rather than solely pneumonia-related deaths."}
