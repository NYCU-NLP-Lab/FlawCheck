{"The amount of money approved by Congress for Hurricane Sandy relief": "The expert's verdict mentions that Congress approved a $60 billion aid package, but it questions the claim that only 10 percent of this amount was for disaster relief. The expert's analysis suggests that the $50.5 billion package passed by Congress included $17 billion for immediate Sandy aid, but it is not clear how much of the remaining amount was specifically allocated for disaster relief.", "Allocation of funds for immediate aid vs": "long-term assistance and mitigation: The expert's verdict highlights that $17 billion of the $50.5 billion package was designated for immediate Sandy aid, while $33.5 billion was allocated for \"near- and long-term assistance and mitigation.\" This distinction raises questions about how much of the total amount can be considered as direct disaster relief.", "Definition of": "disaster relief\": The expert's analysis mentions that the term \"disaster relief\" can have different interpretations depending on the perspective. This ambiguity makes it challenging to determine the exact portion of the approved funds that can be categorized as disaster relief.", "Comparison with other specific expenses": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was contradicted by the fact that potential spending for flood insurance alone was nearly $10 billion, which is more than the 10 percent ($6 billion) that Cardenas claimed. This comparison raises doubts about the accuracy of Cardenas' statement and adds to the complexity of determining the exact allocation of funds for disaster relief."}
