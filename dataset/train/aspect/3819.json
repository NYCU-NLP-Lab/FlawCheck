{"The expert points out that the number quoted for U": "S. military expenses by Mike Huckabee is only what the U.S. Department of Defense spends, which is 3.8 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). However, defense spending is spread across many other budgets, and the nation's entire national defense budget is about 4.2 percent of GDP.", "The expert highlights the fact that Huckabee": "s statement seems to be comparing federal government spending on the military to total spending in the U.S. on health care, including both government and private spending. The expert mentions that Huckabee's 17 percent of GDP figure closely resembles a projection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which estimated that the U.S. would spend about 16.2 percent of GDP on national health expenditures in 2007.", "The expert mentions that the same study shows that if private sector money is subtracted": "health care expenses by the federal government drop to 5.5 percent of GDP. When state and local government spending is added, the total health care expenditure reaches 7.6 percent of GDP. This aspect emphasizes the inclusion of private and public expenses in the calculation of health care costs.", "The expert criticizes Huckabee for comparing government": "only spending on the military with the total cost of U.S. health care, as it artificially inflates the disparity between the two costs. The expert argues that while including private sector expenses in the calculation of health care costs is valid, comparing it to government-only spending on the military is misleading."}
