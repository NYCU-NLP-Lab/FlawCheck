{"The federal report on": "Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress\" prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service was consulted to verify the claim. This report outlines the eligibility criteria and calculations for pension benefits for members of Congress.", "The key provision mentioned in the report states that no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless they have served in Congress for at least five years": "This information helps verify that the claim of receiving full pay retirement after serving one term is not accurate.", "The eligibility criteria for collecting a pension as outlined in the report were examined": "It states that a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service. This information contradicts the claim of receiving full pay retirement after serving only one term.", "The calculations for determining the size of a pension were analyzed based on the information provided in the report": "The pension amount is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service, and a multiplier. This calculation method further refutes the claim that members of Congress receive full pay retirement after serving one term."}
