{"Reverse image search": "The expert employed a reverse image search to verify the authenticity of the claim. This search led them to a story from WKRG-TV in Mobile, Ala., which was published by WFLA-TV in Tampa. The lead photo for that article, captured by Getty Images, was identical to the one published on Facebook. However, the story was published in May 2018, before Hurricane Dorian formed in the Atlantic Ocean.", "Comparison with early reports and images": "The expert compared the image in the claim with early reports and images from the Bahamas, specifically the Abaco Islands. The New York Times reported widespread devastation with thousands of homes destroyed, and early images from the Associated Press showed flooding and structural damage. By comparing these early reports and images with the image in the claim, the expert could determine if it accurately depicted the hurricane damage.", "Lack of response from the original poster": "The expert messaged the user who posted the photo on Facebook to inquire about its source but did not receive a response. This lack of response raised doubts about the credibility of the claim and prompted further investigation.", "Inconsistencies in the image details": "The expert may have examined the image closely for any inconsistencies or discrepancies that could indicate manipulation or misrepresentation. This could include analyzing the quality, lighting, angles, or any other visual cues that could suggest the image was not genuine or was altered in some way."}
