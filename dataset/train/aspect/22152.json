{"Residence listed in official documents": "The expert noted that businessman Andy Gronik listed his residence as N. Beach Drive in Fox Point, an upscale suburb in Milwaukee County, when filing papers to run for governor. This suggests that his official residence is in Fox Point, not Milwaukee.", "Social media and campaign website information": "Gronik's Twitter account and campaign website also state that he lives in Fox Point. The expert mentions that his home in Fox Point has an assessed value of $1.4 million, further supporting the claim that his residence is in this suburb.", "Contradictory statements": "During an education forum for Democratic candidates for governor, Gronik portrayed himself as having lived in Milwaukee for all 61 years of his life. This statement contradicts the information from his official documents and online presence, raising doubts about the authenticity of his claim.", "Comparison to other candidates": "The expert highlights that another candidate, Matt Flynn, explicitly stated that he is the only gubernatorial candidate who lives in Milwaukee. This comparison suggests that Gronik's claim of living in Milwaukee may be an attempt to connect with voters in the heavily Democratic city."}
