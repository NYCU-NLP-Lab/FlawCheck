{"The expert verified the claim by examining the statement made by former Barack Obama Florida director Steven Schale on Twitter": "where he mentioned Marco Rubio's support of an earmark ban and provided evidence of Rubio's requests for earmarks in 2002.", "The expert cross": "referenced the information provided by Schale with the archived member budget requests for 2002 on a state website. This allowed them to confirm that Rubio did indeed request funding for 37 projects totaling $43,697,787.", "The expert compared Rubio": "s stance on earmarks during his U.S. Senate campaign, where he advocated for a ban on budget earmarks, with his actions during his time in the Florida House of Representatives. This helped establish whether Rubio's position on earmarks had changed over time.", "The expert also considered the context of the budget year in Florida in 2002": "which was described as a bad budget year with tight financial constraints. This context provided additional insight into Rubio's requests for earmarks and their significance in the overall budget."}
