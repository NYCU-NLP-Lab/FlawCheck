{"The ad claimed that stimulus money funded": "studying ants in Africa\" and specifically mentioned a cost of $1.9 million for the project.", "PolitiFact Virginia investigated the claim and found that while the stimulus bill did not directly mention": "ants,\" it allocated $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which then decided which projects to fund. The ant research in Africa was one of the projects funded.", "The project": "s leader, Brian Fisher, confirmed that the ant research project received funding from the stimulus and highlighted the importance of ants in understanding climate change, disease spread, and natural disasters.", "PolitiFact Oregon previously examined a similar claim about ant research being funded by the stimulus and concluded that the claim was false because the ant research was not funded at the time of the vote": "However, in this case, the ad's claim aligns with the fact that stimulus money did go towards studying ants in Africa."}
