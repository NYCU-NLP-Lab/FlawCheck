{"Conflicting statements": "The expert's verdict highlights that Biden has given conflicting statements about what advice he gave Obama regarding the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. In 2012, he said he told Obama \"don't go,\" but in 2015, he said he told Obama \"go.\" This inconsistency raises questions about the authenticity of his claim.", "Private conversations": "The expert mentions that it is challenging to fact-check Biden's claim because his conversations with Obama were largely private. This aspect suggests that verifying the authenticity of the claim becomes difficult due to the lack of public evidence or records.", "Recasting of account": "The expert points out that Biden has recast his account of what he told Obama over time. In 2013, he started to revise his statement, and in 2015, he completely changed his stance. This aspect indicates a lack of consistency in Biden's narrative, further questioning the authenticity of his claim.", "Testimony from other officials": "The expert mentions that CIA Director Leon Panetta and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates both had different opinions on whether Obama should go forward with the raid. Panetta said \"go,\" while Gates said \"don't go.\" This aspect suggests that there are conflicting testimonies from other officials, adding to the complexity of verifying Biden's claim."}
