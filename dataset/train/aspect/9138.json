{"The image is a doctored photo": "The expert determined that the image showing President Trump's photograph on the floor of a Starbucks was manipulated. The image was found to be a fabrication, with Trump's photo added after the fact.", "Source credibility": "The expert found that the claim originated from a website called DepartedMedia.com, which is known for sharing fake news. Facebook also flagged the website as potentially being made up. This raises doubts about the credibility of the source.", "Inaccurate timing": "The expert discovered that the original image used in the claim was taken in March 2014, before Trump even announced his presidential campaign. This contradicts the claim's implication that the photo was recent and related to Starbucks' political stance.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert found no other photos or evidence to support the claim that Starbucks placed Trump's photo on the floor for customers to step on. The only image available was the manipulated one shared on social media."}
