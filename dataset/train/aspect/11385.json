{"Testimony from eyewitnesses": "The expert mentions that troops under Russian command and in unmarked uniforms fired their weapons into the air on March 4 at the Russian-occupied Belbek airbase in Crimea. This provides firsthand testimony and evidence of Russian troops in Ukraine.", "Reports from reputable news outlets": "The expert cites articles from the New York Times, Reuters, and The Guardian that describe the presence of Russian-speaking, armed soldiers in Crimea. These soldiers were observed unloading from armored vehicles with uniforms that lacked insignia but featured Russian military plates. The reports also highlight the control exerted by \"pro-Russian troops\" in Crimea.", "Historical context": "The expert mentions that Crimea was part of the Soviet Union until 1954, when it was given to Ukraine. However, Russia maintains a military base in Sevastopol under a post-Soviet breakup treaty. This historical context supports the plausibility of Russian troops operating in Crimea.", "Denial from Russian President Vladimir Putin": "The expert notes that Putin denied Russian troops were occupying Crimea during a news conference. While this may not directly verify the authenticity of the claim, it adds another aspect to consider in the overall assessment of the situation."}
