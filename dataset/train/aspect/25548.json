{"State Sen": "Amanda Chase's claim: The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the actual statement made by State Sen. Amanda Chase during a radio interview on WRVA in Richmond. She stated that the Southside precinct in Chesterfield, Virginia, is infamous for having over 100% of the vote count, which she believes is a clear indication of voter fraud.", "Lack of evidence provided": "The second aspect is the fact that State Sen. Amanda Chase failed to provide any substantial evidence to support her claim. When pressed by the radio host to prove her fraud claim, Chase could only rely on her personal experiences from years past and anecdotal evidence of voters coming in with stacks of votes. However, she did not present any concrete evidence or specific instances of voter fraud in the Southside precinct during the recent election.", "Fact": "checking by experts: The third aspect employed to verify the claim is the fact-checking conducted by experts. In this case, the experts examined election records from the Chesterfield registrar's office to determine the accuracy of Chase's claim. They found that the Southside precinct, established in 2008, had a turnout of 70% in its highest year (2008), which was below the statewide average of 74%. This contradicts Chase's claim of over 100% vote count in the precinct.", "Lack of recent investigation": "The fourth aspect is the acknowledgment that there was no recent investigation or examination of the Southside precinct during the 2020 election. State Sen. Amanda Chase admitted that she hadn't looked at that particular precinct this year and relied on past experiences. This lack of recent investigation or evidence undermines the credibility of her claim of voter fraud in the Southside precinct."}
