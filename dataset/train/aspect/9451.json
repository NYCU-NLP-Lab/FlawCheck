{"Ongoing trial": "The expert's verdict states that Israa al-Ghomgham's trial is still ongoing, indicating that she has not yet been sentenced to death or executed. This suggests that the claim of her execution is not authentic.", "Conflicting reports": "The expert mentions scattered online reports, some with video evidence, claiming that Saudi authorities executed Israa al-Ghomgham. However, these reports are contradicted by other sources, indicating a lack of consensus and raising doubts about the claim's authenticity.", "Verification from multiple sources": "The expert mentions that Saudi sources, human rights sources, and media outlets have confirmed the execution of Israa al-Ghomgham. This suggests that the claim has been cross-verified by different entities, increasing its credibility.", "Misidentified video": "The expert clarifies that the video shared online actually shows the execution of another woman, Laila Bint Abdul Muttalib Basim, who was executed in 2015 for a different crime. This discrepancy in the video evidence further casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim regarding Israa al-Ghomgham's execution."}
