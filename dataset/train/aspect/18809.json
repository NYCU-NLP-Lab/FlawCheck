{"Age data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics": "The expert's verdict mentions that the average age of fast food workers is 29. This claim is supported by data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically the 2012 Current Population Survey, which shows that the median age of front-line workers (including those in fast food) is 29.2. This data provides evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Additional source supporting the age claim": "The expert's verdict also mentions a 2012 Atlantic story that cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics and states that the median age for fast food workers is over 28. While Maher used the term \"average age,\" experts suggest that the median age is a better representation of the fast food worker population as a whole. This additional source reinforces the claim about the age of fast food workers.", "Study on public assistance": "The expert's verdict refers to a study conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Urban and Regional Planning, and University of Massachusetts-Boston Labor Resource Center. This study, funded by Fast Food Forward, concludes that over half (52 percent) of the families of frontline fast food workers are enrolled in one or more public programs. The study provides evidence to support the claim that most fast food workers are on some form of public assistance.", "Funding and credibility of the study": "The expert's verdict mentions that the study on public assistance was funded by Fast Food Forward, a group that supports raising the minimum wage. While this information does not directly verify the claim, it is important to consider the funding source and potential biases when evaluating the credibility of the study."}
