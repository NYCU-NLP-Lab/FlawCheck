This inconsistency raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification through Trump Twitter Archive": "The expert used the Trump Twitter Archive, an online tool that documents all of Trump's tweets, to search for the words \"Cyril\" and \"Masisi\" mentioned in the alleged tweets. They found that Trump had never used these words in his tweets, further indicating that the tweets were fake.", "Confirmation from US embassy spokesman": "The expert obtained confirmation from Robert Mearkle, a US embassy spokesman in Pretoria, who stated that the screenshots attributed to Trump were \"fake.\" This confirmation from an official source added credibility to the verdict that the claim was not authentic."}
