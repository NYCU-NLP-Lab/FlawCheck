{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that the claim relies on questionable websites and clickbait mills as sources of information, rather than citing peer-reviewed scientific papers. This raises concerns about the credibility and reliability of the claim.", "Pseudoscientific reasoning": "The claim is based on the concept of \"detoxifying your body\" through nutrition, which is a common trope in pseudoscientific literature. The expert highlights that there is no scientific basis for the claim that mixing cream of tartar with orange juice can flush nicotine from the body or aid in quitting smoking.", "Misinterpretation of scientific facts": "The claim suggests that the potassium in cream of tartar can replenish potassium levels in the body affected by smoking, and that the vitamin C in orange juice can overcome nicotine's blocking effect. However, the expert explains that while potassium and vitamin C are important for cellular processes and overall health, there is no scientific evidence to support their role in removing nicotine from the body or aiding smoking cessation.", "Expert opinion": "The expert, a professor specializing in addiction, dismisses the claim as \"ridiculous\" and lacking any scientific basis. This expert opinion further undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
