{"Lack of evidence of voter impersonation": "The expert's verdict mentions that the backers of the legislation in Ohio failed to provide any evidence of voter impersonation at the polls, which is the problem that the voter ID law claims to solve. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the necessity of the law and its impact on voter participation.", "Disproportionate effect on minority groups": "The expert's verdict highlights that several national studies have found that ethnic and racial minorities, students, senior citizens, the disabled, and the poor have lower rates of having government-issued IDs. This suggests that the voter ID law could disproportionately affect these groups and potentially hinder their participation in voting.", "Increase in voting among all racial groups in Georgia": "The expert's verdict mentions that the bill's sponsor pointed to voting data from Georgia, where a voter ID law was implemented, to support the claim that the law has not dissuaded black voters from participating. The data shows an increase in voting among all racial groups in Georgia, including a significant increase in the African-American vote. This suggests that the voter ID law may not have had a negative impact on voter participation in Georgia.", "Lack of causation evidence": "The expert's verdict questions whether the photo ID requirement was the cause of the increase in voting in Georgia, as suggested by the speaker. It mentions that Batchelder's office did not provide a response to this question. This lack of causation evidence raises doubts about the claim that the voter ID law was the sole or primary reason for the increase in voting in Georgia."}
