{"The claim was verified by analyzing the language of the bill itself": "The expert mentions that the one-sentence bill states that law enforcement officers \"may arrest a person for a law violation that is punishable by a civil forfeiture.\" This language supports the claim that minor offenses would now be arrestable offenses.", "The expert also refers to a memo from the state Legislative Council": "which provides legal and research services to the Legislature. The memo states that the bill provides law enforcement officers with \"additional arrest authority\" for state civil forfeitures. This further confirms that the claim is accurate.", "The fact that the bill passed one Assembly committee with a unanimous vote of 9": "0 is another aspect that verifies the authenticity of the claim. This suggests that there is support for the bill and that it is being taken seriously by lawmakers.", "The expert mentions that the bill is waiting to be scheduled for a vote by the full Assembly": "The fact that the bill has reached this stage in the legislative process indicates that it is a legitimate proposal and not just a speculative idea."}
