{"The claim originated from a screenshot of a Google search result that purportedly showed the translation of": "homework\" spelled backward as \"krowemoh,\" which in Latin translates to \"child abuse.\"", "The screenshot used to support the claim was taken from a viral post that resurfaced on Twitter in 2013": "indicating that the claim has been circulating for several years.", "Online Latin": "to-English dictionaries and Google Translate confirm that \"krowemoh\" does not exist in Latin, and the actual translation for \"child abuse\" in Latin is \"puer abusus.\"", "The Latin alphabet does not include the letters K and W": "and the letter W is represented by the letter U in Latin, which can only occur before a vowel.
