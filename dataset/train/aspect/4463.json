{"The claim was found to be published in the 1995 book": "A 2nd Helping of Chicken Soup for the Soul,\" which credits the narrative to Dan Clark, a motivational speaker and life coach. This verifies that the story was not originally attributed to Katharine Hepburn.", "The story": "s connection to Katharine Hepburn was debunked by the expert, stating that it has no association with the legendary actress. This indicates that the claim of Hepburn writing about her father giving away money for circus tickets is false.", "The expert mentions that if the story were actually about Hepburn": "the $20 her father supposedly gave away in the past would be equivalent to about $270 in 2020 dollars. This provides historical context and further discredits the claim.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that David Mikkelson founded Snopes.com, the source of the information, in 1994. This establishes the credibility and expertise of the source used to verify the authenticity of the claim."}
