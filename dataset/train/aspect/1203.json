{"The use of voter information from multiple states": "The claim was verified by comparing voter records from North Carolina with records from other participating states in a project run by the Kansas Secretary of State's Office called Interstate Crosscheck. This involved matching voter information such as first name, last name, date of birth, and Social Security number.", "Matching criteria": "The verification process relied on matching specific criteria, including first name, last name, date of birth, and Social Security number. The claim was supported by finding 765 voters in North Carolina who matched on all these categories with someone who voted elsewhere during the 2012 general election.", "Additional matches": "In addition to the 765 voters who matched on all criteria, there were an additional 35,570 North Carolina voters who matched on first and last name and date of birth, but not Social Security number. This aspect indicates a potential need for further investigation to determine if these matches indicate instances of double voting.", "Expert opinions": "The expert's verdict included the opinions of political commentator Dick Morris and former Federal Election Commission member Hans von Spakovsky. Their statements supported the claim by emphasizing the significance of the data and the potential for over a million people to have voted twice in the 2012 election."}
