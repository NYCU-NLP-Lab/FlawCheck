{"Autopsy findings": "The autopsy conducted on Sonia Azevedo concluded that her death was not caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. This supports the claim that the adverse side effects mentioned in the claim were not the cause of her death.", "FDA findings": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that there were no serious side effects observed in the tens of thousands of participants enrolled in studies for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This suggests that adverse effects leading to death are highly unlikely.", "Uncertainty about the vaccine administered": "It is unclear whether the vaccine administered to Sonia Azevedo was specifically the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This ambiguity raises questions about the accuracy of attributing her death to the mentioned vaccine.", "Discrepancies in reporting": "Various news outlets, such as WION, Russia Today, and the Daily Mail, published headlines suggesting that Sonia Azevedo died due to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the original source of the news, Correio da Manh\u00e3, did not describe Azevedo as a nurse and mentioned her occupation as an operational assistant at the Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Oncologia (IPO) in Porto. These discrepancies in reporting indicate the need for careful evaluation of the information presented."}
