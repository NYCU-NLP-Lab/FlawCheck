{"Ground subsidence": "The expert mentioned that ground subsidence, which is the sinking of the ground in certain areas, can exacerbate the problem of rising sea levels. This aspect was employed to verify the claim that rocks falling into the ocean contribute to observable sea level rise.", "Sediment flow from rivers": "The expert acknowledged that rivers and streams constantly carry tons of material, including silt, sand, dissolved solids, and possibly rocks, into the world's ocean basins. This aspect was used to support the claim that the deposition of sediment into the seas forces the sea levels to rise.", "Displacement of water": "The expert agreed with Congressman Brooks' statement that when something is put into water, it displaces the water and causes it to rise relative to the volume of the object. This aspect was mentioned to acknowledge the basic physics principle, but it was also emphasized that on human timescales, the amount of water displaced by sediment flow is essentially undetectable in terms of sea level rise.", "Lack of meaningful contribution": "The expert's verdict concluded that while sediment flow and erosion do contribute to the overall volume of the oceans, they do not significantly contribute to the sea level rise attributed to anthropogenic global warming. This aspect was employed to refute the claim that rocks falling into the ocean have a meaningful impact on observable sea level rise."}
