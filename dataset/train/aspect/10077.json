{"The expert evaluated the claim made by We Are Wisconsin that Gov": "Scott Walker took away $1.6 billion from schools and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich.", "The expert examined the accuracy of the claim regarding school cuts and found that the claim overstated the figure": "While some sources use the $1.6 billion figure, experts determined that the actual savings on K-12 education, compared to the previous budget, was $800 million to $900 million.", "The expert also assessed the claim about tax breaks for corporations and the rich costing taxpayers": "2.3 billion over a decade. While the changes do result in less revenue over a 10-year period, the expert noted that it is not a direct cost to taxpayers since the tax breaks mean less will be paid in taxes.", "The expert identified a discrepancy in the comparison made by We Are Wisconsin": "The school cuts figure pertains to the 2011-\u201913 budget, while the tax breaks are measured over 10 years. This mismatch inflates the size of the tax breaks and gives a false impression to those receiving the mailer."}
