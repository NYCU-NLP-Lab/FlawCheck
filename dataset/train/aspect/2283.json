{"The claim was analyzed based on the scientific principles involved in popping popcorn": "The expert pointed out that a single AA battery cannot produce enough heat to cause the water within a whole bag of popcorn kernels to turn into steam and build up sufficient pressure to rupture their hulls.", "The behavior of the popping kernels in the video was compared to the expected behavior of popcorn kernels": "The expert noted that the popping kernels in the video did not exhibit the visible force and jumping motion phenomenon associated with the release of steam during popping.", "The expert identified visual cues in the video that suggested the use of a deceptive technique": "The shaking of the bowl in the video was suspected to be a way of bringing already-popped kernels to the surface, while concealing them under unpopped ones. The audio of \"popping\" sounds was likely added to enhance the illusion.", "The source and credibility of the claim were considered": "The expert mentioned that the claim originated from the LADbible website, which is not known for scientific accuracy. Additionally, the expert's affiliation with Snopes, a reputable fact-checking organization, adds to the credibility of their analysis."}
