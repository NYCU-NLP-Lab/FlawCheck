This information helps provide context to the claim and assess its accuracy.", "Political posturing and previous votes": "The expert's verdict mentions that votes to raise the debt ceiling are often politically motivated, and it highlights that in 2006, then-Senator Obama joined other Senate Democrats in voting against raising the debt limit, despite President George W. Bush's support for it. This information helps evaluate the consistency of Obama's stance on the issue and its relevance to Bachmann's claim."}
