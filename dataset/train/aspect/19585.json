{"Lebanese officials have attributed the Beirut explosion to the ignition of more than 2": "700 tons of ammonium nitrate, and they have not ruled out a \"rocket or bomb\" as a possible cause of the fire. This official statement contradicts the claim linking the explosion to human trafficking by Hillary Clinton.", "There is no evidence to support the claim that Hillary Clinton or a sex trafficking operation had any involvement in the Beirut explosion": "The expert's verdict states that the conspiracy theory is baseless and has been discredited.", "The Facebook post that circulated the claim included a screenshot of footage from Al Jazeera": "where a rectangular object was circled in the background. The caption on the image read \"Evergreen Shipping Container\" and claimed it was linked to human trafficking by HRC (Hillary Rodham Clinton). However, this claim lacks any substantial evidence or credible sources.", "The conspiracy theory promoted on Facebook after the Beirut explosion is based on the false premise that Hillary Clinton is part of a global child sex trafficking operation": "This theory relies on connecting Clinton's Secret Service code name \"evergreen\" with the name of a Taiwanese shipping company, which is allegedly linked to sex trafficking. However, this theory is unsupported by any factual evidence or logical reasoning."}
