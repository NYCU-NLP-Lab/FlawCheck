{"Lack of specific information": "The expert notes that the claim lacks specific details such as the name of the tribe or the specific location in Africa where the ritual takes place. This lack of specific information raises suspicions about the authenticity of the claim.", "Source of the photograph": "The expert identifies the source of the photograph as photographer Jessica Hilltout, who took the image in Ghana in 2008. This information helps to verify the authenticity of the photograph and provides context for understanding its true meaning.", "Context of the photograph": "The expert explains that the photograph actually depicts a young man posed with his football team, engaging in a \"spontaneous gesture\" before a recreational sporting match. This information contradicts the claim that the photograph shows an African tribe performing a ritual, further questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "Personal experience of the photographer": "The expert includes quotes from Jessica Hilltout, the photographer, describing her experience in the village and the context of the photograph. Hilltout's personal account adds credibility to the explanation provided by the expert and reinforces the fact that the photograph does not depict a ritual to reconnect a misbehaving person with their good nature."}
