{"The claim mentions tax deductions for birds flying across America": "which initially raised eyebrows and seemed obscure.", "The tax deductions in question are related to conservation easements": "which involve landowners pledging to forgo future development to preserve the land's natural state and provide habitat for animals, including migratory birds.", "The deductions are calculated based on the difference between the pre": "donation value and post-donation value of the land, which can be deducted as a gift on the landowner's tax returns.", "These deductions can be substantial": "potentially eliminating up to half of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, and can be carried over for up to 15 future tax years until the value of the donation is exhausted. However, they have been criticized for disproportionately benefiting the ultra-rich."}
