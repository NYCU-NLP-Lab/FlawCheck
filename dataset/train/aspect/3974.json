{"The statement made by Attorney General Brad Schimel is cited as the source of the claim": "2. The claim is supported by a 2011 news release from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that quoted 2008 figures on prescription painkiller use, abuse, and related deaths.", "The CDC Director": "Thomas Frieden, is quoted in the news release confirming that overdoses involving prescription painkillers were at epidemic levels and surpassed the combined deaths from heroin and cocaine.", "There is a discrepancy in the data due to an adjustment made by the CDC regarding fentanyl": "a synthetic painkiller, which is both prescribed and illegally produced. However, other credible healthcare organizations and federal agencies support the claim made by Schimel."}
