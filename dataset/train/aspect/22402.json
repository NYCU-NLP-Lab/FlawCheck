{"The claim made by Tommy Thompson was that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent": "it results in a billion dollars leaving the US economy and going to Saudi Arabia.", "The expert": "s analysis revealed that a 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas corresponds to a 42 cent rise in the price of a barrel of crude oil.", "Based on the import data of Saudi petroleum in 2011": "it was estimated that the US would pay Saudi Arabia slightly over $183 million per year due to a 1-cent increase in gas prices. This contradicts Thompson's claim of a billion dollars going to Saudi Arabia from the US economy."}
