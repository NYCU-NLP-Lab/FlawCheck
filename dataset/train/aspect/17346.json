{"Spelling and grammatical errors": "The supposed order circulating on social media contains multiple spelling and grammatical errors, which is atypical for an official document.", "Mention of non": "existent website: The order mentions a website, indiantourism.org, which does not exist. The official website of the Tourism Ministry is tourism.gov.in, and government websites typically end with '.gov' or '.nic'.", "Lack of news reports": "A keyword search on Google did not yield any news reports confirming that hotels, restaurants, and resorts would remain closed until October 15. This absence of credible news sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Official denial by the Ministry of Tourism": "The Press Information Bureau of India's fact-checking handle on Twitter labeled the order as fake and confirmed that it had not been issued by the Ministry of Tourism. This official denial further supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
