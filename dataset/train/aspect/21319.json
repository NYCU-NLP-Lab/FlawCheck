{"The claim originated from a satirical website": "The expert's verdict states that the claim about Vice President Kamala Harris supporting deep cuts to veterans' programs and telling them to \"get a job\" originated from a satirical website called America's Last Line of Defense. This indicates that the claim is not based on factual information.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence to suggest that Harris made the statements attributed to her. The claim has not appeared on her official social media accounts, such as Twitter or Facebook. This lack of evidence further undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Harris": "actual plans for veterans' benefits: The expert's verdict highlights that during her 2020 presidential campaign, Harris announced plans to expand veterans' health benefits and housing assistance. Her plan also aimed to create new economic opportunities for military families. This contradicts the claim that she supports cuts to veterans' programs.", "Biden administration": "s proposed funding for veterans: The expert's verdict mentions that the Biden administration proposed $20 billion for veterans' health care in the American Rescue Plan, which provides over $15 billion for veterans. This contradicts the claim that Harris and the administration are seeking to cut funding for veteran services."}
