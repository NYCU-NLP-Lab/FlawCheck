{"The claim is stated in multiple sources": "The claim that Commissioner Amanda Fritz saved ratepayers $6 million a year is mentioned in her first television commercial, the Voters' Pamphlet, her campaign website, and The Oregonian's Voter Guide. This consistency across various platforms adds credibility to the claim.", "Previous fact": "checking by PolitiFact Oregon: PolitiFact Oregon has previously fact-checked Commissioner Fritz's claim and found that she did save ratepayers $6 million in 2010-11. This fact-checking process adds an extra layer of verification to the claim.", "Commissioner Fritz": "s role in advocating for a cheaper water treatment system: Commissioner Fritz argued for a $100 million system using ultraviolet rays to treat water instead of a more expensive $385 million system. This decision, which was ultimately approved by the City Council, contributed to potential cost savings for ratepayers.", "The change in circumstances regarding the need for a treatment system": "Despite the initial plans for a treatment plant, it was later determined that the city would not have to build a treatment system at all. Despite this change, Commissioner Fritz still argues that she can claim a $6 million savings every year into the future. This aspect raises questions about the accuracy and validity of the claim."}
