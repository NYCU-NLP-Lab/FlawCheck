{"The video misleadingly edits Bill Gates": "2010 TED Talk, taking his comments on reducing population growth out of context and suggesting a nefarious plan to depopulate the world through vaccines.", "The video uses a computer": "generated voiceover to further imply a deadly plan, adding ominous music and an apocalyptic image of a syringe in front of a pile of skulls.", "The video ignores the broader context of Gates": "talk, which focused on the need to zero out carbon dioxide emissions through new approaches to energy production to fight climate change.", "The video selectively presents a 2009 story in the Guardian that reported Gates and other philanthropists discussing overpopulation as a serious issue": "while ignoring that the group also discussed a range of other issues such as education, government reform, and the economic crisis at that time."}
