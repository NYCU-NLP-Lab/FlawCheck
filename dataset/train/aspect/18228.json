{"McCain": "s courage to call for change and not play politics with the truth: McCain's stance on Iraq and his criticism of the Bush administration's handling of the war demonstrate his willingness to speak out against his own party and prioritize the truth over political considerations.", "Distinction from other Republican contenders": "The claim highlights McCain as the only candidate who sacrificed for his country, opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq, had the courage to call for change, and didn't play politics with the truth. The expert's verdict mentions that among the other Republican contenders, only Ron Paul had military experience, but he did not go to war like McCain did."}
