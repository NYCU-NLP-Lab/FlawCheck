The Worldwatch Institute's \"Global Status Report\" confirmed the rise of China as a competitive force in renewable energy and highlighted its manufacturing leadership in the sector.", "The focus of the verification process was on the production and energy capacity of countries": "rather than solely on manufacturing. This approach was taken because most organizations studying global renewable energy do not concentrate solely on the manufacturing of wind turbines and solar panels.", "The expert": "s verdict emphasized the need for readers' help in publishing the truth and being informed participants in democracy. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim was thoroughly examined and verified to ensure the dissemination of accurate information."}
