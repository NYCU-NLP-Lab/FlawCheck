{"The viral meme falsely identified a": "23.9 million mansion as Rep. Nancy Pelosi's home, but Pelosi actually lives in a $2.3 million house in the same neighborhood.", "The turreted mansion in the picture is located at 2724 Pacific Avenue in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco and is owned by 2728 Pacific LLC": "not Pelosi or her immediate family.", "Pelosi": "s actual residence and other properties she owns, including a vineyard and two commercial properties in San Francisco, are listed on her financial disclosure, but there is no mention of the turreted mansion or 2728 Pacific LLC.", "The claim that Pelosi called": "1,000 bonus checks \"crumbs\" is based on a criticism she made of GOP tax changes, comparing the benefits that would flow to corporations versus the bonuses they were giving to workers."}
