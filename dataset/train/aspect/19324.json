{"Discrepancy in the article": "The content of the article contradicts the headline, stating that the grade 12 results will be released on a different date than mentioned in the claim. This indicates a lack of accuracy in the information presented.", "Inaccurate number of candidates": "The claim states that 700,000 learners wrote their matric exams, while the actual number of candidates was 1,058,699. This discrepancy undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Questionable source": "The claim originated from an article published on Opera News App, an international news aggregator. However, the platform features articles from various sources, including those with aliases or auto-generated names that cannot be verified. This raises doubts about the reliability of the source.", "Warning of dubious news": "The website hosting the article was flagged by the tool Know Knews as potentially containing dodgy news. Additionally, Opera News is listed under \"fake news\" by Infraplex, an information and telecommunications company in South Africa. These warnings suggest a lack of trustworthiness in the platform and the article itself."}
