{"Different measures of drug prices": "The expert highlights that there are different ways to measure drug prices, with President Trump referring to what consumers and insurers pay at retail pharmacies, while Sen. Kamala Harris refers to list prices for a basket of drugs.", "Lack of a comprehensive measure": "The expert states that there is no single measure that accurately captures drug pricing trends, making it difficult to determine whether prices have gone up or down.", "Variation in prices depending on drugs and supply chain": "The expert explains that the answer to whether prices have gone up or down depends on the specific drugs being considered and at which point in the supply chain. List prices may be rising for some brands, but net prices (after rebates, discounts, etc.) may be falling.", "Use of the consumer price index": "CPI): The Trump administration relies on the CPI for prescription drugs, which measures drug price inflation based on what consumers and their insurance companies are paying for a basket of retail prescriptions. The most recent figures show a 2% drop in the CPI for prescriptions from June 2018 to June 2019. However, the expert notes that the CPI had also dropped in July 2013."}
