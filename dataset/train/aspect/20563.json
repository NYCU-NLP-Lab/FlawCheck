{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert points out that there is no credible source to support the claim that Prince invested in Nike in 1971 or recruited Michael Jordan in 1983. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Contradiction with known facts": "The expert highlights that Prince would have been only 12 or 13 years old in 1971, making it highly improbable for him to have invested in Nike at that time. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest Prince's involvement in Jordan's Nike deal in 1983, which contradicts other accounts and historical documentation.", "Absence of media reports": "The expert states that no media reports have been found to support the claim of Prince's involvement in Nike and the design of Air Jordans. Given Prince's fame in the mid-80s, his alleged role in these events would have been significant news, but no credible sources mention it.", "Expert opinion": "The expert, Joseph Vogel, who has written a biography on Prince, dismisses the claim as an odd myth. He emphasizes that the history of Nike and Air Jordans has been thoroughly documented, and Prince's name does not appear in any credible sources. Vogel's expert opinion further discredits the authenticity of the claim."}
