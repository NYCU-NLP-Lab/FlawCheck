{"The claim is based on a letter signed by U": "S. Rep. Allen West, along with 65 other freshmen Republicans, calling for support of the \"miscellaneous tariff bill\" which would reward tariff breaks for certain items.", "The claim is supported by a statement from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee": "which accuses West of \"begging\" Republican leaders to bring back earmarks based on his support for the tariff breaks.", "The claim is related to the similarity between the tariff breaks and earmarks": "both of which involve seeking special benefits for specific items or industries.", "The claim is further supported by the fact that earmarks are currently banned": "and West's support for the tariff breaks could be seen as contradicting the earmark ban that Republicans campaigned on and instituted in 2010."}
