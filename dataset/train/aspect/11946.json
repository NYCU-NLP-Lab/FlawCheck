Berger and Nancy Pelosi never took place, indicating that the claim is not authentic.", "Lack of credible accounts supporting the discussion": "Despite searching for evidence, no credible accounts were found to support the claim of Gen. Berger refusing Pelosi's request, further questioning the authenticity of the claim.", "Statements from reliable sources": "Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, dismissed the claims as \"false and absurd,\" while Capt. Casey Littesy, communication strategy and operations officer for the Marine Corps, called the article \"unequivocally false and inaccurate.\" These statements from reliable sources cast doubt on the veracity of the claim.", "Joint statement from military officers": "Gen. Berger, along with other high-ranking officers, released a joint statement condemning the attack on the Capitol and reaffirming that Joe Biden will be inaugurated as the 46th president.
