{"The claim was made by West Virginia Governor Jim Justice in a tweet": "where he stated that hunters contribute more than $500 million to the state each year and help support a lot of jobs. This is the primary source of the claim.", "The claim was also supported by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources": "which sent a tweet using the same dollar figure and stating that deer hunters alone spend an estimated $230 million in West Virginia, particularly in rural areas of the state. This provides additional evidence for the claim.", "The claim was further verified through a press release from the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources": "which included the $500 million figure and stated that hunting is estimated to be responsible for 5,400 jobs and $35 million in sales taxes on goods and services spent in West Virginia. This press release cited the numbers from a research firm called Southwick Associates.", "The authenticity of the claim was confirmed by the Southwick Associates report": "which stated that there had been $421,819,113 in retail sales in West Virginia due to hunting, with a multiplier effect raising that amount to $552,085,233. The report also mentioned the creation of 5,377 jobs and the collection of $35,544,522 in state and local taxes specifically attributed to hunting. These figures align with the claim made by Governor Justice and provide further evidence of its authenticity."}
