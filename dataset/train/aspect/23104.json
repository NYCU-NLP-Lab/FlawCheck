{"The claim is based on a statement made by Tom Barrett": "the Democratic challenger, who accused Gov. Scott Walker of \"cooking the books\" by releasing job numbers that he just dreamed up before the election.", "The first aspect used to verify the claim is the fact that the job numbers released by Gov": "Walker were based on actual job counts from 95 percent of Wisconsin employers. These numbers are normally submitted to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for review and verification.", "The second aspect is the unusual decision for the state": "rather than the BLS, to release the job count. While it is rare for the state to release these numbers, it does not mean they were \"dreamed up.\" The job count is derived from an extensive process regularly reported to the federal government.", "The timing of the job count release": "three weeks before the recall election, raises questions about its intention and validity. The official release of job counts by the BLS was scheduled for three weeks after the election, making the early release by Gov. Walker questionable according to the Barrett campaign."}
