{"Advocacy by Warren Buffett and President Barack Obama": "The expert's verdict mentions that billionaire investor Warren Buffett has advocated for higher tax rates for high-income taxpayers. Additionally, President Obama has also called on Congress to raise taxes on the rich and provide tax breaks to the middle class. These statements from influential figures support the claim that middle-class Americans pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires.", "Introduction of the Paying a Fair Share Act": "Senator Tammy Baldwin and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse introduced the Paying a Fair Share Act, also known as the 'Buffett rule.' This legislation aims to address the unfairness of middle-class Americans paying a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires. The introduction of this act serves as evidence to support the claim.", "Analysis by the Congressional Research Service": "The expert's verdict mentions a March 2012 analysis conducted by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The analysis states that a \"large proportion\" of millionaires pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes compared to a \"significant proportion\" of moderate-income taxpayers. This analysis provides empirical evidence to verify the claim that middle-class Americans pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires.", "Disparity in tax rates": "The expert's verdict highlights that some middle-class Americans are paying higher tax rates, although not all. This acknowledgment of the disparity in tax rates further supports the claim that middle-class Americans are burdened with higher tax rates compared to millionaires and billionaires."}
