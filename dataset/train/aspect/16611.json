{"The expert highlights the historical context of the claim": "explaining that it is part of a pattern of attempts to minimize or smear the message of those advocating for gun control in the wake of the Parkland shooting.", "The expert mentions the creation of memes and doctored images that labeled David Hogg as a Nazi and claimed he gave a Hitler salute": "This demonstrates the existence of false information being spread on social media.", "The expert points out that videos readily available on the internet clearly show that Hogg did not give a Nazi salute but instead raised a single closed fist into the air": "This provides visual evidence contradicting the claim.", "The expert explains the differences between a closed fist and the infamous Nazi salute": "emphasizing that the gesture Hogg made is not associated with Nazis and has its own political meanings of solidarity, resistance, and strength. This further discredits the claim by providing historical and cultural context."}
