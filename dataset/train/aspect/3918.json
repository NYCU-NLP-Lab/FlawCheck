However, there was no evidence found to support the allegations of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) creating a fake account with a Muslim name to incite social unrest.", "The investigation also highlighted that Naveen": "the person arrested for sharing a post against Muhammed, the prophet of Islam, could not have been responding to Adyar Basheer's post, as it no longer existed on Facebook.
