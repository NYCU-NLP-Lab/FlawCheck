{"The IRS workload": "The expert mentions that one aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim is the IRS workload. The expert states that the IRS keeps track of its workload and the data shows that the volume of 501(c)(4) applications had actually dropped a bit from the year before the screening began. This contradicts the claim of a surge in applications in 2010.", "Number of applications": "Another aspect used to verify the claim is the actual number of 501(c)(4) applications received by the IRS. The expert provides the data for the number of applications in each fiscal year, showing that there was no significant surge in applications in 2010 compared to previous years.", "Timeline of tea party screening": "The expert mentions that the inspector general's report provides a detailed timeline of when the tea party screening began. The report states that the earliest jump in applications related to tea party groups would have been in October 2010, which is after the IRS started giving selective treatment to these groups. This timeline contradicts the claim that there was a surge in applications in 2010.", "Criteria for screening": "The expert also mentions that the inspector general's report states that the criteria used for screening tea party-related applications were \"Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12.\" This information further supports the claim that there was no surge in applications in 2010, as the screening based on these criteria began well before that year."}
