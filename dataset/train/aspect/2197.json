{"The timing of the account": "The expert notes that the account of the game was given and published by William \"Wild Bill\" Setley in 1937, which was 44 years after the game took place. This raises questions about the accuracy of Setley's memory and the potential for embellishment or distortion of the events over time.", "Lack of corroborating witnesses": "The expert mentions that memories blur and fade over time, and potentially corroborating witnesses may have disappeared or died off. This raises doubts about the availability of other individuals who can verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Setley": "s reputation as a storyteller: The expert highlights that Setley was already well known as \"a wag\" and \"a great story teller\" even before his account of the game was publicized. This suggests that Setley may have a tendency to exaggerate or fabricate stories, casting doubt on the veracity of his specific claim about the baseball game.", "Discrepancies with known facts": "The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) provides additional information indicating that Setley's version of the story combines elements from a well-known urban legend and a real-life 1894 Allentown game where Mike Kilroy hit a game-ending single. This suggests that Setley's account may be a mixture of fictional elements and actual events, further undermining its authenticity."}
