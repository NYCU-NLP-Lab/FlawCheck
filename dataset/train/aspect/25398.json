{"Phil McGraw": "s statement was based on a worldwide number of annual deaths from swimming pools, not just the U.S. This was confirmed by McGraw himself, who admitted to misspeaking and cited the World Health Organization's figure of 320,000 deaths per year.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention": "CDC) reported that there were 3,709 deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in the U.S. in 2017. It is important to note that not all drowning deaths occur in swimming pools, as drowning can also occur in natural water bodies or even bathtubs.", "McGraw": "s comparison of swimming pool deaths to other causes of death, such as automobile accidents and cigarette use, is flawed. While his statistics on cigarette-related deaths (over 480,000 per year) and motor vehicle crash deaths (40,231 in 2017) were generally accurate, the number of swimming pool deaths he mentioned was significantly overstated.", "The expert emphasizes that the comparison between swimming pool deaths and the COVID": "19 pandemic is misleading. Unlike drowning, which is not infectious or contagious, the coronavirus is highly contagious and has led to a significant number of deaths in a short period. Therefore, the decision to shut down the country is based on the unique characteristics and risks posed by the virus, rather than a direct comparison to other causes of death."}
