{"Testimony from Elizabeth Warren herself": "Warren has repeatedly shared her claim of losing her job as a speech therapist in Riverdale, New Jersey, because she became pregnant. She has mentioned this in a Democratic primary debate, in her book \"A Fighting Chance,\" and during a rally in Oakland, California.", "Corroborating evidence from local news reports": "Local news reports from the time period confirm that Warren was indeed hired as a speech therapy instructor in Riverdale, New Jersey, in the fall of 1970. These reports also mention that she worked two days per week.", "Board of Education minutes": "The minutes from a Riverdale Board of Education meeting held on April 21, 1971, show that a new contract was approved for Warren and other teachers for the following school year. This provides evidence that Warren was not fired or let go due to her pregnancy.", "Lack of contradictory evidence": "Despite the claim being widely known and discussed, no evidence has been presented to contradict Warren's story or dispute the details of her employment in Riverdale. The absence of contradictory evidence adds weight to the authenticity of her claim."}
