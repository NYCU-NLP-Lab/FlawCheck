{"The claim falsely states that getting flu shots in the past ten years will result in a positive test for the Wuhan strain of the Covid": "19 flu. Experts and the Food and Drug Administration confirm that this is not true.", "Influenza viruses and coronaviruses are distinct from each other": "COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus, not by the flu. Therefore, getting a flu shot will not lead to a positive test for COVID-19.", "Flu shots use inactivated or weakened flu viruses to stimulate an immune response": "and it takes time for the body to develop antibodies after vaccination. These antibodies are specific to the flu and do not cross-react with the proteins or genetic fragments of the novel coronavirus.", "Both PCR tests and antibody tests for COVID": "19 are designed to specifically detect and identify the unique genetic fragments and proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These tests do not cross-react with influenza viruses or antibodies, and there have been no observed cases of cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and the flu in FDA-authorized tests."}
