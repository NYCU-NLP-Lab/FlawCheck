{"The expert analyzed the delegate count and explained that Ted Cruz currently has between 542 and 559 delegates": "which falls significantly short of the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination on the first ballot.", "The expert highlighted that Donald Trump": "s landslide victory in New York, where he is projected to win 89 delegates while Cruz received none, further diminishes Cruz's chances of reaching the required delegate count.", "The expert explained the delegate process and clarified that while Cruz may have a path forward in subsequent ballots if no candidate reaches the threshold on the first vote": "Trump's statement specifically refers to Cruz being mathematically out of winning the race on the first ballot.", "The expert mentioned that there are still 674 delegates up for grabs in 15 remaining contests": "but even if Cruz were to win all of them, he would still need at least 678 more delegates to secure the nomination, which is mathematically impossible unless he gains significant support from already allocated delegates."}
