{"The identity of the person named Christopher Harrington was investigated": "and it was found that he is not a government employee who filed a patent for a mask in 2015. The photograph used in the claim was identified as a generic stock photo of a businessman.", "The existence of a patent for a mask with the serial number CV19": "N95 was searched, and no such patent was found. This suggests that the claim of Christopher Harrington filing a patent for this mask in 2015 is not authentic.", "The patent history of Bill Gates was examined": "and there was no record of him filing a CV19-N95 patent in 2015. This contradicts the claim that Gates had filed a similar patent six months earlier.", "The authenticity of the claim was further undermined by the discovery of an uncropped version of the meme": "which included a disclaimer stating that all the claims in the meme were fictitious. This indicates that the meme was created as a joke and not based on factual information."}
