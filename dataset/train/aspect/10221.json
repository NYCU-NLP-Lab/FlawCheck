{"The claim that hippos produce naturally pink milk is based on a combination of two unrelated facts": "the secretion of hippusudoric acid in the hippo's sweat and the assumption that this acid is also present in their milk, turning it pink.", "Biologist David Wynick states that there is no evidence suggesting that hippos secrete hippusudoric acid into their milk": "indicating that the claim lacks scientific support.", "Hippos actually produce white or beige": "colored milk similar to that of other mammals, debunking the notion of naturally pink milk. The pinkish appearance of a hippo's exterior is due to the secretion of hippusudoric acid, which acts as a natural suntan lotion and is not present in their milk.", "Social media posts often accompany the claim with a photograph that supposedly shows bottles of pink hippo milk": "However, the image is misleading and actually depicts a dairy-free strawberry milkshake recipe, further discrediting the claim."}
