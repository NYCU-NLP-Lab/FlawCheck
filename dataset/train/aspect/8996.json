{"Limbaugh": "s claim that there were \"11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land in the United States\" is factually incorrect. The last major hurricane to hit the United States was Hurricane Wilma in 2005, which struck Florida's west side as a Category 3 storm.", "Brian McNoldy": "a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, tweeted that it had been approximately 10.9 years (or 4,000 days) since the last major hurricane hit the United States. This contradicts Limbaugh's claim of 11 straight years.", "The definition of a": "major\" hurricane is a storm that is categorized as a Category 3, 4, or 5, based on its intensity and maximum wind speed. It does not refer to the size, damages, or fatalities caused by the storm.", "The National Hurricane Center": "which provides hurricane forecasts, is controlled by the National Weather Service under the administration's Commerce Department. Limbaugh's accusation that the Obama administration manipulated hurricane forecasting to push the climate change agenda is unfounded."}
