{"Lack of evidence": "The expert found no evidence to support that George Washington ever said or wrote the quoted statement. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Mount Vernon": "s spurious quotations: The quote in question is included in Mount Vernon estate's list of spurious quotations attributed to George Washington. This list further discredits the claim and suggests that the quote is misattributed.", "Attribution to Joe Spenner": "The quote appears in a pamphlet titled \"President George Washington's Thoughts on Firearms\" under the byline Joe Spenner. This attribution to Spenner, rather than Washington, indicates that the quote belongs to the author of the pamphlet and not the first president.", "Research by Barry Popik": "Barry Popik, an etymologist and consulting editor for the Oxford English Dictionary, researched the quote in 2014 and concluded that it was written around 2002. This research supports the notion that the quote is not authentic and has been circulating relatively recently."}
