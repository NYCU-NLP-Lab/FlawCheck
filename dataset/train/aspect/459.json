{"Multiple Facebook posts": "The expert found that the claim was supported by multiple Facebook posts that had published the purported photos of dead or affected animals. These posts had been shared thousands of times, indicating their widespread circulation.", "Captions and descriptions": "The captions accompanying the photos played a crucial role in verifying their authenticity. The captions mentioned the impact of the Australian bushfires on animals, such as the deaths of over 480 million animals. These specific details added credibility to the claim.", "Comparison with credible sources": "The expert compared the photos in question with images from credible sources to determine their accuracy. They found that some of the photos were misleadingly shared in the context of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires. By conducting reverse image searches and examining news reports, the expert identified the original sources of the photos, which were unrelated to the recent bushfires.", "Debunking of misleading claims": "The expert also mentioned that misleading claims linking certain photos to the Australian bushfires had been previously debunked. By referring to AFP's previous fact-checks, the expert could confirm that some of the photos were inaccurately associated with the bushfires and were actually depicting different incidents, such as the burning of stuffed animals or past bushfire events in Australia."}
