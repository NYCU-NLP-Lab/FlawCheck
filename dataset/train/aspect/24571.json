{"State Sen": "Vogel co-sponsored a bill to raise the minimum marriage age to 18, with no exceptions, even for pregnancy. This bill also included penalties for those attempting to bypass the age restriction by marrying out of state.", "Virginia law currently sets the minimum age for marriage at 16": "with exceptions for cases of pregnancy. Minors require parental or guardian consent, and those under 16 must obtain a marriage license from a local circuit court clerk.", "The Tahirih Justice Center": "a nonprofit organization focused on violence against immigrant women and girls, supports Vogel's bill and provided evidence in the form of a chart obtained from the Virginia Department of Health. The chart showed instances of marriages involving children as young as 12, with brides and grooms aged 13, 14, and 15 throughout the years 2004 to 2013. Additional data from the Department of Health revealed marriages of 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds, and at least 170 brides who were 15 years old from 2004 to 2014."}
