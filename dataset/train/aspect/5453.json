{"Unsubstantiated claims on social media": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim about Joe Biden receiving the debate questions in advance and wearing an earpiece is based on unsubstantiated posts spreading on Facebook and Twitter. These claims lack evidence and are not supported by credible sources.", "Baseless story promoted by a conservative radio host": "The expert's verdict mentions that a conservative radio host, Todd Starnes, pushed the baseless story on Twitter, stating that Joe Biden got the debate questions in advance. Starnes' tweet gained significant traction, being shared more than 11,000 times. However, the source of this claim was an interview with Jerome Corsi, a known conspiracy theorist.", "Denial by Fox News spokesperson": "The expert's verdict includes the response from a Fox News spokesperson who rejected the claim that Chris Wallace, the debate moderator, had sent out any questions prior to the debate. This denial from a credible source adds weight to the authenticity assessment.", "Confirmation by the Commission on Presidential Debates": "The expert's verdict mentions that the nonpartisan host of the debate, the Commission on Presidential Debates, publicly announced that Chris Wallace had selected the topics for the debate. These topics were disclosed in advance and did not include sharing the specific questions with either campaign or the debate commission. This confirmation from the commission adds credibility to the assessment that the claim is unsubstantiated."}
