{"Democratic U": "S. Rep. Joyce Beatty's statement: The claim about 1,000 children becoming victims of human trafficking in Ohio each year was initially made by Democratic U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio during a press conference in May 2016. This statement serves as the basis for the claim's authenticity.", "Ohio government websites": "The claim is supported by the fact that the \"1,000 children\" statistic appears on various Ohio government websites, including the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force's website. The task force, convened by Governor John Kasich, is responsible for addressing human trafficking in the state.", "Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force report": "The most recent report from the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force, published in 2015, contradicts the claim. It states that only 181 potential victims of trafficking were identified statewide in 2014, and this number includes both children and adults. This report raises doubts about the annual estimate of 1,000 children becoming victims of human trafficking in Ohio.", "Questionable study commissioned by the Ohio Attorney General": "s Office: The claim's origin can be traced back to a study commissioned by the Ohio Attorney General's Office in 2010. This study used data from an FBI program called \"Operation Innocence Lost\" and extrapolated the number of minor victims of sex trafficking in Toledo to estimate the figure for the entire state of Ohio. However, this methodology has been criticized for its lack of control and potential overestimation."}
