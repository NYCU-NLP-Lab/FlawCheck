The expert pointed out that the president may have been referring to U.S. trade in just goods with Canada and Mexico, rather than overall trade.", "The expert highlighted that the existing threshold for North American auto content under NAFTA is 62": "5 percent, which was not mentioned by the president in his announcement of the new trade agreement. The expert also noted that this threshold is already the highest among any current U.S. trade agreement.", "The expert mentioned that the new trade agreement": "USMCA, requires at least 75 percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for free access to U.S. markets. However, the president did not mention the existing threshold of 62.5 percent.", "The expert cited a report from the Center for Automotive Research": "which stated that there is no loophole in meeting the 62.5 percent threshold for North American auto parts. The report also mentioned that automakers may prefer to pay the 2.5 percent tariff instead of increasing the percentage of North American auto parts, depending on cost-effectiveness."}
