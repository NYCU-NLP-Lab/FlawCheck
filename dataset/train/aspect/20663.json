{"The date and context of the photograph": "The expert mentions that the photograph in question was taken on February 5, 2021, during a meeting in the actual Oval Office between President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss their COVID-19 relief package. This establishes the authenticity of the claim by providing a specific date and event associated with the photograph.", "Comparison with other photographs": "The expert provides a comparison between the viral image of President Biden and a photograph of former President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Both images show a similar \"crack\" in the wall, which is actually a partially opened door. This comparison helps debunk the claim that the photograph shows a movie set, as it demonstrates that the \"crack\" is a normal feature of the Oval Office.", "Explanation of the hidden doors": "The expert explains that the Oval Office has four doors, two of which are designed to blend in with the walls. This design choice was made for aesthetic purposes and does not indicate the presence of a movie set. The expert also includes a video showcasing these hidden doors, further reinforcing their existence and purpose.", "Lack of evidence for a movie set": "The expert emphasizes that the claim of the photograph showing a movie set is based solely on the initial appearance of a crack in the wall. However, the expert provides evidence and explanations to counter this claim, such as the comparison with other photographs and the explanation of the hidden doors. This lack of substantial evidence for a movie set supports the authenticity of the claim that the photograph was taken in the actual Oval Office."}
