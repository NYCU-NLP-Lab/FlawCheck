{"The claim made by President Donald Trump that El Paso went from being one of the most dangerous cities to one of the safest cities overnight after a wall was put up along the Mexico border": "2. The first pivotal change in El Paso border enforcement in 1993, which involved a flood of border patrol agents along the immediate border, not the erection of a border wall.", "The second change was the construction of a border fence as a result of the Secure Fence Act of 2006": "but this alone does not support the claim that it transformed the city from one of the most dangerous to one of the safest.", "Historical data from the Uniform Crime Reports of the FBI": "which consistently shows that El Paso has had a lower violent crime rate compared to other big cities in Texas and the national average for cities with 500,000 or more residents. El Paso has also had the lowest murder rate among the state's six largest cities for decades."}
