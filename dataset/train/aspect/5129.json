{"Planned Parenthood": "s decision to pull out of the federal program: The expert's verdict states that Planned Parenthood decided to withdraw from the Title X program due to new rules that would restrict their ability to provide or refer patients for abortions. This decision highlights the organization's commitment to reproductive health options and their stance on the new rules.", "Source of the claim and its verification": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim regarding 79% of Title X patients relying on Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin was taken from a Planned Parenthood graphic, which in turn obtained the statistics from the Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. This indicates that the claim was sourced from a reliable and reputable organization, adding credibility to its authenticity."}
