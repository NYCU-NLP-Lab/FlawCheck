{"The image in the Facebook post was found to be part of a diabetes awareness poster created by the British Diabetic Association in the early 90s": "This verifies that the claim of the image representing the number of vaccines a baby born in 2019 receives is false.", "A Google reverse image search of the image led to the discovery of the original poster on Behance": "a social networking site for designers. This further supports the authenticity of the claim being false.", "A spokesperson for Diabetes UK": "the new operating name for The British Diabetic Association, confirmed that the image was part of an old awareness campaign specifically related to the average number of injections needed for babies or children with diabetes. This statement reinforces that the image has no connection to vaccines.", "The vaccination policies vary from country to country": "and both the Australian Department of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a hepatitis B vaccination at birth. This information highlights the importance of early vaccination for certain diseases but does not support the claim made in the Facebook post."}
