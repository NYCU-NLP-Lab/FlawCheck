{"State law in Texas prohibits touching animals until they are chest deep in water or mud": "otherwise it can be considered theft. This law applies to everyone, including law enforcement officers.", "There is no specific law in Texas that determines when an animal rescue is or is not considered theft due to water and mud levels or any other circumstance": "3. Stealing certain animals, such as horses, cattle, and exotic livestock, is a third-degree felony in Texas if the total value of the animals is up to $150,000.", "While there is no provision in Texas law specifically allowing exceptions for rescuing animals from floods": "it is highly unlikely that someone who rescues an animal from death or injury would be prosecuted for theft, unless they refuse to return the animal to its owner. Prosecutors have limited resources and prioritize more urgent and egregious crimes, and they generally avoid pursuing cases they are unlikely to win."}
