{"Discrepancy in appearance": "The expert points out that tick eggs do not resemble the objects shown in the photograph. They highlight the differences in texture, translucency, and size between the depicted objects and actual tick eggs.", "Comparison with known examples": "The expert mentions the eggs of the soft-bodied Argasidae family and black-legged ticks as reference points for the size and appearance of tick eggs. They use a CDC scaled image and Photoshop scaling to estimate the size of the eggs in the photograph, which further supports their conclusion that they are not tick eggs.", "Lack of transparency": "Tick eggs are described as being more translucent, whereas the objects in the photograph are non-translucent. This difference in transparency serves as evidence against the claim that the objects are tick eggs.", "Alternative explanation": "The expert proposes an alternative interpretation for the objects in the photograph, suggesting that they could be the ovaries of a frog or another amphibian regurgitated by a predator. This alternative explanation is based on discussions found on Reddit and a similar-looking stock image described as \"Common Frog spawn.\""}
