This means that there was no significant advantage in terms of fundraising for either candidate.", "Independent expenditures by political action committees": "According to state Government Accountability Board reports, JoAnne Kloppenburg had a decided edge in independent expenditures by political action committees. This suggests that there may have been a financial advantage on her side.", "Claims made by conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes": "Sykes claimed that JoAnne Kloppenburg's side had a \"3-to-1 money advantage.\" However, there is no evidence or data provided to support this claim, and Sykes did not respond to requests for backup.", "Claims made by Bob Dohnal": "publisher of the Wisconsin-based Conservative Digest: Dohnal circulated an email stating that conservatives were outspent 10 to 1.
