{"The claim is debunked by the expert": "s analysis of the source, BreakingNews247.net, which is described as a prank website that publishes fictional and humorous news. The disclaimer on the website further confirms that the information should not be taken seriously or as a source of information.", "The expert points out that the photograph used in the claim is legitimate but unrelated to the alleged protest": "It is a picture of New York Yankees pitcher Vernon \"Lefty\" Gomez and his fellow pitchers from 1936, well before the time when black players were even allowed in major league baseball. This suggests that the claim of white players kneeling to protest lynchings in the 1950s is historically inaccurate.", "The expert highlights that the photograph was taken before game time and not during the playing of the national anthem": "The absence of spectators standing at attention or placing their hands over their hearts indicates that the picture was not taken during a moment of national anthem performance. Additionally, the tradition of playing the national anthem before regular-season baseball games did not become standard practice until after the start of World War II, several years after the alleged protest in the 1950s.", "The expert compares the alleged protest to the more recent demonstrations against police brutality led by former football player Colin Kaepernick in 2016": "They emphasize that only one Major League Baseball player, Bruce Maxwell, has followed suit by kneeling during the national anthem. This further casts doubt on the claim that a significant number of baseball players were involved in such protests in the 1950s."}
