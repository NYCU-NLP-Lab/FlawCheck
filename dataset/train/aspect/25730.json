{"The claim is based on an anecdote from Mama Cass Elliot herself": "who stated that she experienced an increase in her vocal range after being hit on the head by a pipe. This aspect verifies the source of the claim and the origin of the information.", "The expert": "s verdict concludes that while it is possible for a head injury to have various effects on a person, including changes in personality or memory loss, there is no scientific basis to support the claim that a knock on the head can increase a singer's vocal range. This aspect emphasizes the scientific perspective and the lack of plausibility in the claim.", "The expert also mentions that Mama Cass Elliot had been singing since she was a child and had professional singing experience prior to the incident": "This aspect suggests that her vocal range would have already been established before the accident, making it unlikely for a head injury to suddenly increase her range."}
