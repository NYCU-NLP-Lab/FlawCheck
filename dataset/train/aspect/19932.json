{"Van Jones": "self-avowed communist statement: Glenn Beck, a radio and TV political commentator, claimed that Jones \"is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist\" based on a remark made by Beck on his radio program. This statement indicates Jones' own admission of being a communist.", "Jones": "association with radical individuals and organizations: In a profile of Jones, it is mentioned that he met radical communists and anarchists while in jail and spent the next 10 years working with them. Additionally, Jones formed a socialist collective called STORM, which focused on Marxist political education.", "Transformation of Jones": "politics and work: The same profile article states that Jones began transforming his politics and work even before the disbandment of STORM in 2002. This suggests a shift in Jones' ideological beliefs and raises questions about his current affiliation with communism."}
