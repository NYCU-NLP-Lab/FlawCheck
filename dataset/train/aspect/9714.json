{"Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that the Obama administration allowed most immigrants who passed an initial credible fear review to be released into the United States pending a full hearing": "This aspect suggests that the high number of asylum claims may be due to a lenient release policy rather than a genuine increase in meritorious claims.", "Sessions argued that changes in case law had expanded the concept of asylum beyond congressional intent": "creating more incentives for illegal aliens to come to the U.S. and claim fear of return. This aspect implies that the broad interpretation of asylum laws may have led to an increase in fraudulent claims.", "President Donald Trump outlined tighter controls of the asylum process": "including elevating the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews. This aspect indicates that the Trump administration is seeking to reform the asylum process to address concerns about the authenticity of claims.", "Lindsay M": "Harris, an assistant professor of law, argued that the increase in asylum claims corresponds with the increase in refugees worldwide, including those from south of the U.S. border. This aspect suggests that the rise in asylum claims may be a result of genuine humanitarian crises rather than a sudden surge in fraudulent claims."}
