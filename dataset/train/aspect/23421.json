{"The voting record": "The expert's verdict confirms that 12 Republican House members voted against H.R. 1085, the bill that aimed to award Congressional Gold Medals to the U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police for their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.", "Alternative proposals": "It is mentioned that all but two of the 12 House members who voted against the bill sponsored, co-sponsored, or supported alternative proposals that either awarded Congressional Gold Medals to the Capitol and D.C. Metro Police or expressed gratitude to those officers for their actions in protecting the Capitol on Jan. 6.", "Lack of response": "Snopes reached out to all 12 House members in question to inquire about their support for awarding Congressional Gold Medals to the Capitol Police and D.C. Metro Police specifically for their roles in protecting the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack. However, they received no response from any of them.", "Context of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a left-leaning Facebook page called Occupy Democrats, which posted a meme condemning the 12 Republican House members for voting against awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Capitol Police officers. The meme was related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack by supporters of then-President Donald Trump."}
