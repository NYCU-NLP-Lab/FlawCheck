{"The historical accounts of the Prophet Muhammad do not support the claims made on the billboard": "such as committing rape or torturing people. Instead, he was known for freeing slaves, not \"dealing\" them.", "The story about the billboard was originally reported by the local Fox affiliate WXIN": "and the nonprofit arm of the right-wing media outlet Daily Caller published a regurgitation of the story. This indicates that the information on the billboard is based on local reporting and not verified historical sources.", "The claim made on the billboard that Muhammad married a 6": "year-old is incorrect. In reality, his wife was 6 years old when she became engaged to him and 9 years old when they were married. This discrepancy in age undermines the accuracy of the claim.", "The accuracy of the details surrounding the historical events mentioned on the billboard": "such as beheading 600 Jews in one day or having 13 wives, remains contested by scholars and the Muslim community. The reliability of accounts of the Prophet's life, written at least 200 years after his death, is also questioned, making it difficult to determine the authenticity of these claims."}
