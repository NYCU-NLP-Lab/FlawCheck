{"The claim states that Maine Gov": "Janet Mills is using taxpayer money to buy cars for those on welfare without a public hearing on the rules. The expert's verdict confirms that the claim is partially true, as the program to help welfare recipients secure reliable transportation does exist, but the cars are not free and recipients who sell them for cash would face consequences through the welfare system and potential law enforcement involvement.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the claim is misleading, as it gives the impression that welfare recipients will receive free cars that they can easily sell for profit. In reality, the program offers various transportation options, including furnishing purchased or donated vehicles, connecting to public transportation, private transportation, car shares, ride services, shuttle services, or driving instruction and education. This aspect helps to debunk the exaggerated nature of the claim."}
