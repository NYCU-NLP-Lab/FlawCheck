{"Historical origins of the KKK": "The expert's verdict highlights that the KKK was founded by a group of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tennessee, as a social fraternity. It quickly transformed into a violent group that targeted black and white Republicans in the South.", "Link between the KKK and Democrats": "The expert acknowledges that there is a historic link between the KKK and the Democratic Party, as many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats and some joined the KKK. However, it is misleading to claim that the Democratic Party founded the Klan.", "Evolution of the Democratic Party": "The expert emphasizes that the Democratic Party of the past is not the same as the Democratic Party today. From the 1930s onward, the Democratic Party has been associated with being the party of the disenfranchised.", "Reversal of party platforms": "The expert, along with Carole Emberton, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo, points out that the platforms of the Democratic and Republican parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century. This shift was largely due to the white \"Dixiecrats\" leaving the Democratic Party."}
