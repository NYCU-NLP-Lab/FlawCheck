This data point was included in the comparison to determine if the state budget increase outpaced population growth.", "Contextual considerations": "While the experts confirmed the accuracy of the claim based on the provided data, they also emphasized that this particular method of measurement may not be the most comprehensive or appropriate way to assess state budget growth.
