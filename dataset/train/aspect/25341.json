{"The expert": "s verdict mentions that President Barack Obama has consistently proposed changes in charitable deductions that some religious organizations and nonprofit groups say would reduce giving by the rich. This indicates that there have been ongoing discussions and proposals regarding charitable deductions.", "The expert also mentions that the president": "s proposal for fiscal year 2013 includes a reduction in deductions for individuals making over $200,000 a year or families reporting income greater than $250,000. This specific threshold for higher-income taxpayers is an aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert quotes Roberton Williams": "a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, who states that the Obama plan is \"limiting, not eliminating\" charitable deductions for higher-income Americans. This statement provides further evidence that the claim of complete elimination of charitable deductions is not accurate.", "Nick Kasprak": "an analyst at the Tax Foundation, mentions the Pease Limitation and wonders if Santorum was referring to it. This reference to another policy or limitation related to charitable deductions is another distinct aspect employed to verify the claim."}
