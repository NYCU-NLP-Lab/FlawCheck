{"The claim is supported by data from the report": "which states that Wisconsin has the highest infant mortality rate for black babies nationwide, ranging from 8.27 to 14.28 deaths per 1,000 live births for infants of non-Hispanic black women.", "State Representative Shelia Stubbs": "a Democratic lawmaker, highlighted the racial disparities in Wisconsin's infant mortality rate during a news conference, emphasizing the reality faced by Black families and the need to address this issue.", "The CDC": "s definition of infant mortality as the death of an infant before their first birthday and the calculation of the infant mortality rate as the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births provide a standardized measure to verify the claim.", "The concentration of infant mortality in the City of Milwaukee": "particularly among black mothers, is cited as a significant factor contributing to Wisconsin's high infant mortality rate. Stress during pregnancy and the prevalence of premature births in impoverished areas with a high concentration of minorities are identified as key factors in this disparity."}
