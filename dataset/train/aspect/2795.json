{"The claim that COVID": "19 vaccines will contain RFID chips for tracking individuals is a baseless conspiracy theory with no factual basis.", "The decision of whether children will be required to take a COVID": "19 vaccine before returning to school will be made at local levels and based on various factors, not universally mandated.", "There is no evidence to support the claim that many kids will die from the COVID": "19 vaccine, as no effective vaccine exists and no children have been reported to have died from it."}
