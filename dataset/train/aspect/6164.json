{"The claim made in the ad is that Catherine Cortez Masto indicted Brian Krolicki": "an innocent man, in order to save Harry Reid's political career.", "The ad features the 18": "year-old daughter of Brian Krolicki claiming that Cortez Masto was willing to hurt her family by trying to prosecute her father during her time as the state's attorney general.", "Cortez Masto": "s decision to pursue felony charges against Krolicki has been used as an example of her close relationship with Harry Reid, as the charges came shortly after Krolicki began exploring a run against Reid in 2010.", "The case against Krolicki was eventually thrown out before it went to trial": "leading to his technical innocence in the eyes of the law. However, the decision to indict was not baseless, as Krolicki had previously been the target of a probe into possible financial mismanagement."}
