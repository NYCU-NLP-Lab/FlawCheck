{"The claim states that in President Barack Obama": "s 2015 State of the Union address, the words \"al-Qaida\" were never used, which is verified by the expert's statement that \"the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001.\"", "The expert provides evidence by mentioning that Fox News": "chief political anchor, Bret Baier, noted the absence of the words \"al-Qaida\" in Obama's speech, stating that it was remarkable for what it left out.", "The expert further supports the claim by highlighting the significance of the omission": "considering the speech's proximity to the Charlie Hebdo attacks and heightened warnings about a possible attack from \"core\" al-Qaida. This adds context to the claim and strengthens its authenticity.", "The expert compares Obama": "s speech to previous State of the Union addresses by President George W. Bush and Obama himself, stating that every address since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have included references to al-Qaida. This comparison provides historical evidence and reinforces the claim's authenticity."}
