{"Multiple social media posts": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was posted on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, with the same or similar claims about President Museveni buying more than 100 pairs of sporty shoes. This suggests that the claim was widely circulated and discussed.", "Appearance in an article on a Kenyan blog": "The claim also appeared in an article on a Kenyan blog called Bana, which publishes online news and entertainment. The article headline specifically mentions President Museveni buying more than 100 pairs of sporty shoes to lure youthful voters. This adds to the credibility of the claim as it was reported by a news source.", "Lack of evidence from the Daily Monitor": "The expert's verdict states that despite efforts to verify the claim through the Daily Monitor, no evidence of such a report was found. The Daily Monitor is a reputable news source in Uganda, and the lack of evidence from them suggests that the claim may not be true.", "Reverse image search leading to a different individual": "The expert's verdict mentions that a reverse image search led to an article from 2017 featuring a different individual named Wicknell Chivayo, a businessman from Zimbabwe. The article describes his shoe collection and the backlash he faced for flaunting his wealth. This suggests that the image used in the claim is not of President Museveni, but of Wicknell Chivayo."}
