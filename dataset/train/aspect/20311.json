{"The ad is based on a pay discrimination lawsuit filed by female managers at Dollar General while David Perdue was CEO of the company": "The lawsuit accused the chain of paying male managers more than females performing the same job, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963.", "The lawsuit was settled for": "18.75 million several years after Perdue left the company. Dollar General did not acknowledge any liability or wrongdoing, but the settlement agreement promised some policy changes.", "The ad claim is supported by a letter from an area director for the U": "S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, stating that \"available evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe\" that female store managers were discriminated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act. The letter also states that Dollar General's explanation for the pay difference \"is not supported by the evidence.\"", "Sworn statements from several female Dollar General managers supported the claim": "stating that the company had a pay system that perpetuated stereotypes for judging men and women on their pay, performance, and salary needs."}
