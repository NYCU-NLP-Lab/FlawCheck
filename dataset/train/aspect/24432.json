{"Resemblance": "The expert noted that the man in the photograph bears a resemblance to a young Bernie Sanders. However, they emphasized that this similarity alone is not enough to confirm Sanders' participation in the civil rights march.", "Caption information": "The caption provided by the licenser of the photograph, Corbis Images, identifies Martin Luther King, Jr. and other prominent political leaders but does not mention Bernie Sanders. This lack of mention raises doubts about Sanders' presence in the march.", "Availability of the photograph": "The photograph has been widely available for decades, but it was only in January 2016 that Bernie Sanders' name became associated with a face in the crowd. This suggests that the claim linking Sanders to the march is a recent development.", "Sanders": "own statements: While Sanders has acknowledged his participation in the landmark \"March on Washington\" civil rights event in August 1963, where Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous speech, there is no record of Sanders claiming to have been present at any other civil rights march involving King. This lack of personal claim further questions the authenticity of the claim."}
