{"Names": "The expert mentions that while some Christians may have specifically Christian names, many do not. Additionally, the Qur'an also includes biblical names, which may be found among Muslims as well. Therefore, relying solely on names may not be a reliable indicator of someone's Christian identity.", "Birthplace": "The claim suggests that where someone is born can be a telltale sign of their Christian identity. However, the expert points out that while there may be entirely Christian villages in some cases, most Christians in the Middle East live in cities or areas with a mixed population. Therefore, birthplace alone may not be a conclusive factor.", "Ambiguous names": "The expert highlights that many Arabs deliberately choose ambiguous names to avoid religious identification. This further emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on names as an indicator of someone's Christian identity.", "Documentation": "The expert mentions that some refugees do have their birth certificates, and in the case of Syria, these certificates may list the person's religion. While this can provide some evidence, it is important to note that documentation alone may not be sufficient to verify someone's religious affiliation."}
