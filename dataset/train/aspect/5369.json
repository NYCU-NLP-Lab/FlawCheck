{"Use of unrelated photos": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim used two unrelated photos to support the invented story. One photo showed a man dressed as Santa being arrested by the police, while the other was a pixelated image of a man's face. This aspect was employed to verify the claim's authenticity.", "Dubious source and byline": "The expert's verdict mentions that the story was published on a click-bait website called Thug Life, with the byline \"Thug Muncher.\" The use of such a dubious source and a questionable byline raises doubts about the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistent details and over": "the-top witness account: The expert's verdict points out that the story had inconsistencies and exaggerated details. For example, the witness described the Santa on top of the man, screaming obscenities. These inconsistencies and over-the-top accounts cast doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Lack of corroborating evidence and records": "The expert's verdict states that there is no record of the event with the Milwaukee police, and the story first appeared on a click-bait website. Additionally, the photo of the Santa being arrested was from a 2013 protest unrelated to the claimed incident. The absence of corroborating evidence and the presence of contradicting records further question the authenticity of the claim."}
