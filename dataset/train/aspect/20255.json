{"Analysis of the video content": "The expert likely examined the raw footage of the Pakistani news channel's report to analyze the visuals and determine if they align with the claim of showing the aftermath of the Balakot air strike. They may have looked for any inconsistencies or signs of manipulation in the footage.", "Examination of the source and context": "The expert might have investigated the background of the Facebook user, Bhola Nath Varma, who initially posted the videos, as well as Megha Osheen and the Facebook page 4K Viral Hindustan that shared the same video. They may have considered the credibility and motives of these sources to assess the authenticity of the claim.", "Verification of the language and text": "The expert likely examined the language used in the video, particularly the reporter's speech and the text inscribed on the microphone. They may have compared it to Urdu, the language predominantly spoken in Pakistan, to determine if it matched. Additionally, they might have analyzed the text on the microphone to see if it was in Hindi, which would be unusual for a Pakistani news channel.", "Evaluation of viewer comments and doubts": "The expert may have taken into account the doubts expressed by viewers in the comments section of the Facebook posts and the Twitter response. They might have considered the concerns raised about the vegetation in the video and the behavior of the reporters, using these doubts as additional factors in assessing the claim's authenticity."}
