{"Comparison of city council terms": "The expert examined the claim by comparing the length of city council terms in different cities, including Austin. They found that according to the provided spreadsheet, 29 out of 34 cities listed had four-year council terms, five cities had two-year terms, and only Austin had three-year terms.", "Research methodology": "The expert investigated the research methodology used to gather information on city council terms. The mayor's office provided a spreadsheet that was compiled by consultant Mark Littlefield, who relied on city websites and U.S. Census 2007 population estimates to determine the length of council terms in the nation's 30 most populous cities.", "Comparison of population": "The expert compared the estimated population of Austin with other cities to determine if they were comparable. They found that the average population of the other cities listed in the spreadsheet was 30 percent greater than Austin's estimated population in 2009. They also checked the population of the 10 cities closest in size to Austin and found that seven out of the ten cities had four-year council terms.", "Verification from city officials": "The expert sought verification from city officials to confirm the accuracy of the information provided. In the case of Boston, the fact sheet showed four-year terms for council members, but the Boston council's staff director clarified that this was true only for the mayor, indicating a discrepancy in the information provided."}
