{"The origin of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim originated from a Pakistani Twitter user named Nasir Chinioti, who posted two photographs - one of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the other of a lion roaming on streets. This information helps verify the authenticity of the claim by identifying its source.", "Social media propagation": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was shared on various platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, by multiple users. The fact that the claim gained significant traction and was shared by different individuals adds to the verification process.", "Image analysis": "The expert's verdict mentions that a reverse image search was conducted, which revealed that the photograph of the lion roaming on the streets was from South Africa's Johannesburg in April 2016. This analysis helps establish that the image is unrelated to the recent pandemic and undermines the credibility of the claim.", "Historical context": "The expert's verdict provides additional information about the lion seen in Johannesburg, stating that it was brought in for filming by a production crew and was not a result of the Russian government's actions. This historical context further discredits the claim and verifies its inauthenticity."}
