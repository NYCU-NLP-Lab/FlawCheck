{"Comparison of voting records": "The expert mentioned that the authenticity of the claim was verified by comparing the voting records of Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and Frank Guinta. It was found that Shea-Porter did vote with Nancy Pelosi's Democrats 95 percent of the time, as stated in the claim.", "Analysis of independent studies": "The expert referred to two independent studies conducted by The Washington Post and Congressional Quarterly. These studies provided data on the partisan voting patterns of both candidates. The studies confirmed that Shea-Porter had a consistent high partisan unity score, ranging between 95 percent and 98 percent, while Guinta had a similar score of 96 percent and 97 percent in his term in Congress.", "Rebuttal from NRCC spokesman": "The expert mentioned that the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman, Ian Prior, provided a counterargument to the claim. Prior argued that Guinta's ability to implement a tax cap and balance budgets as the mayor of Manchester contradicted the claim that he would \"take on both parties.\" This rebuttal was considered as another aspect to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Assessment of district representation": "The expert also mentioned that the NRCC spokesman argued that Shea-Porter's voting record, which contributed to the 95 percent partisan voting claim, was out of touch with her district. This assessment of district representation was considered as a factor in evaluating the authenticity of the claim."}
