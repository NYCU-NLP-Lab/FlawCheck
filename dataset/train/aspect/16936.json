{"Lack of evidence of employment": "The expert's verdict highlights that the Twitter user \"@randygdub\" did not provide any proof of employment with USPS or any other organization. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Inconsistent and controversial tweets": "The expert points out that the user's other tweets were inconsistent and seemingly published to cause controversy. This suggests that the claim may have been made to provoke a reaction rather than being a genuine account of a postal worker destroying Trump votes.", "Verification from election authorities": "The expert contacted the Franklin County Board of Elections and the Ohio Secretary of State's Elections division to inquire about the mailing format of Ohio's absentee ballots. They confirmed that the ballots are enclosed in two secrecy envelopes, making it impossible for postal workers to identify \"Trump votes\" without opening the envelopes. This verification contradicts the claim.", "Postal Service investigation": "The expert mentions that the Postal Service conducted an investigation and determined that the user \"Raandy\" was most likely not an employee. The Postal Service representative stated that they would continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action if there was substantiated evidence of mail tampering or destruction. This investigation further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
