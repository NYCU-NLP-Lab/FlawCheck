{"Legislative approval": "The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is whether the mentioned measures were actually approved by the Texas Legislature.

As mentioned, the measures that passed through the Legislature also received Perry's approval, indicating their successful implementation.", "Judicial impact": "The third aspect involves examining the impact of the measures that were passed. For example, the claim mentions passing a \"TSA anti-groping bill\" and a measure to bar \"sanctuary cities.\" However, it is noted that these proposals did not actually become law. Therefore, it can be concluded that these aspects were not successfully implemented.", "Supreme Court ruling": "The fourth aspect involves considering any legal challenges or rulings that may have affected the implementation of the measures.
