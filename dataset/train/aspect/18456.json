{"The claim suggests that illegal immigrants can leave detention centers anytime they want to go back to Mexico": "but the expert's verdict clarifies that voluntary departure is possible but not automatic for migrants in detention.", "The expert explains that eligibility for voluntary departure is restricted to certain criteria": "including not having an aggravated felony conviction, being in the U.S. for at least a year, and being deemed of \"good moral character\" by the court.", "The judge in a removal hearing must approve the application for voluntary departure": "and if granted, the immigrant is repatriated within a specified deadline of up to 60 days.", "The expert also highlights that migrants in detention are not free to leave the center at any time and that the government has discretion in granting requests to withdraw applications for admission and return to their home country": "Additionally, the government may prefer to deny voluntary departure requests to make it harder for migrants to re-enter the United States."}
