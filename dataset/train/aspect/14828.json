{"The claim is based on a statement made by Newark Mayor Cory Booker during a radio interview": "where he mentioned statistics showing the extent to which shooting victims in Newark have a criminal history.", "The claim is supported by a study conducted by Anthony Braga": "a professor with Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice, who is researching homicides and nonfatal shootings in the city. The study indicates that 85% of murder victims in Newark between 2009 and 2010 were known to the criminal justice system before they were killed, with an average of 10 prior arrests on their criminal records.", "The claim is corroborated by Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres": "who acknowledged that Booker's statement was accurate and that the statistics come from Braga's ongoing study.", "The claim is aligned with the implementation of a program called": "Operation Ceasefire\" in Newark, which aims to reduce gun violence through targeted law enforcement efforts, social services outreach, and community interaction. The program's implementation suggests that there is recognition of the issue of gun violence and its connection to individuals with a criminal history in Newark."}
