Hubert Humphrey, which contradicts the claim that the Black Panthers created the program.", "There is no evidence that the Black Panther Party operated a program called WIC or something similar": "further disproving the claim.", "The motivation behind WIC was based on various studies throughout the 1960s that identified malnutrition as a major national problem": "not the Black Panther Party's initiatives.", "While the Black Panther Party": "s Free Breakfast for Children Program may have inspired WIC or other similar federal programs, they are not one and the same, indicating that the claim is not authentic."}
