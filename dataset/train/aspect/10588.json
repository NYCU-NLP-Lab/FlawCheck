{"The claim is specifically referring to Medicare Advantage premiums": "which are a private Medicare option that most Medicare beneficiaries do not pay. This distinction is important because it means that the claim does not accurately represent the overall costs of Medicare health plans.", "The average national Medicare Advantage monthly premium only increased by 46 cents under the Obama administration": "This contradicts Trump's claim that premiums went up significantly during that time.", "The claim also fails to acknowledge that the largest premium for Medicare": "Part B physician coverage, has increased under both the Obama and Trump administrations. This undermines the idea that Trump's administration has successfully lowered Medicare premiums overall.", "The claim": "s reference to a 25% increase in Florida's Medicare health plan premiums under Obama is misleading because it specifically refers to Medicare Advantage average premiums, which vary considerably by state. The actual increase in Florida during Obama's two terms was from $6.85 to $8.60 per month, not a 25% increase."}
