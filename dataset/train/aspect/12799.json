{"Lack of credible evidence supporting the rumors of Hillary Clinton": "s poor health, such as the need for assistance in climbing stairs or leaked medical records documenting dementia.", "The image purportedly showing Clinton wearing a defibrillator was taken from a video shot on February 24": "2016, during a fundraiser in North Carolina and has not been altered except for the addition of two red arrows.", "The bulge visible under Clinton": "s right shoulder in the image is not indicative of a defibrillator as it does not match the appearance of a wearable defibrillator, which features two rectangular bulges and requires a large object near the waist.", "Evidence suggests that Clinton was actually wearing a wireless microphone transmitter on her shoulder": "as it is common for reporters or interviewees to conceal the microphone by attaching it to a bra strap or taping it to the inside of a thigh. Additionally, photographs taken at different times on the same day do not show the rectangular bulge, indicating that it was not a defibrillator."}
