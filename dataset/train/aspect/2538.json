{"Comparison with other countries": "The expert compared the claim that the United States is the only nation that affords citizenship to anyone born here, whether legally or illegally, with a list posted online by NumbersUSA. This list showed that there are at least 34 other nations that also allow birthright citizenship, contradicting the claim.", "Fact": "checking previous statements: The expert referenced a similar statement made by conservative pundit Glenn Beck in 2009, which was also rated as false by PolitiFact National. This fact-checking of a previous claim helps to verify the inaccuracy of the current claim.", "Expert opinion": "The expert's verdict is based on their expertise in fact-checking and determining the accuracy of claims. Their conclusion that the claim is false adds credibility to the verification process.", "Clarification from sources": "The expert obtained clarification from U.S. Rep. John Carter's spokesman and the Republican National Committee's spokesman, who both stated that Carter meant the United States is \"one of the few industrialized nations\" that afford citizenship for anyone born here. This clarification helps to provide additional context and perspective on the claim."}
