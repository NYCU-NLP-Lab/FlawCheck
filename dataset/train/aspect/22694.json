{"Lack of credible reports": "The expert's verdict states that there are no credible reports indicating that people who identify as antifa orchestrated the riots at the Capitol. This suggests that the claim lacks substantiated evidence.", "Contradictory evidence": "Videos, pictures, and statements from individuals present at the Capitol contradict the claim that antifa orchestrated the attack. These pieces of evidence point towards Trump supporters being responsible for the violent storming of the Capitol.", "Investigation by law enforcement": "Law enforcement officials are actively investigating the chaos and violence that occurred during the Capitol attack. This ongoing investigation further undermines the claim that antifa orchestrated the attack.", "Weak evidence and attempts to distance from lawlessness": "The expert's review of videos, photos, news reports, and social media posts surrounding the siege shows that the rioters were primarily supporters of President Donald Trump. The evidence linking the attack to antifa is described as weak and suggested to be made by Trump supporters attempting to distance themselves from the lawlessness at the Capitol."}
