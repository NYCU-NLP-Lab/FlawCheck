{"The expert consulted a report from the right": "leaning Tax Foundation, which showed that the United States had the second highest total corporate tax rate among industrialized and emerging nations. This provided evidence to support the claim that the tax on job creating businesses in the United States is 35 percent, second worst in the entire world.", "The expert also considered the national tax rates on companies in nearly three dozen industrialized democracies": "using data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This data showed that the 35 percent federal corporate tax rate in the United States is the highest national rate among these countries.", "To provide a more comprehensive understanding": "the expert examined the combined average corporate tax rate in the United States, which includes both federal and state corporate income tax rates. According to the OECD, the combined average corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent, making it the second highest among industrialized democracies, with only Japan having a slightly higher rate.", "The expert acknowledged that the OECD report only discussed statutory corporate tax rates and did not address deductions and credits that companies can claim in various countries to lower their tax liabilities": "This highlights the complexity of the tax system and suggests that the effective tax rate, which takes into account these deductions and credits, may differ from the statutory rate."}
