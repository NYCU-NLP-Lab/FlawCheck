{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the Vybz Media article did not provide any evidence to support its claims, including the horse's back being broken during filming, the resort putting down the animal, and DJ Khaled paying for its funeral.", "Unattributed quotes": "The article includes two quotes, one from staff at the resort and another from DJ Khaled himself, but neither quote is attributed to a specific source. This raises doubts about the authenticity of the information presented.", "Inaccuracies in the article": "The expert highlights that apart from DJ Khaled riding the horse, every other detail in the article is inaccurate. This suggests that the story is a fabrication rather than a factual account.", "Verification from a reliable source": "The expert contacted Christina Turner, who runs Horseplay in Nassau, Bahamas, and verified her identity. Turner confirmed that DJ Khaled's horse ride lasted less than 10 minutes and that the horse in question, Eclipse, is alive and well. This reliable source contradicts the claims made in the Vybz Media article."}
