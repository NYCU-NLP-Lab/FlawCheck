{"Reports from credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that reports emerged from credible sources such as Fox Business and BNN Bloomberg, which provided details about Coca-Cola's negotiations with Aurora Cannabis for the production of cannabis-infused beverages.", "Confirmation from insiders": "The expert's verdict states that one source with direct knowledge of the talks between the two companies mentioned that they are \"pretty advanced down the path\" of doing a deal. This insider confirmation adds credibility to the claim.", "Statements from Coca": "Cola and Aurora Cannabis: Both companies issued statements that did not outright deny the negotiations. While Coca-Cola emphasized their interest in non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in wellness beverages, they did not deny the possibility of negotiations. This suggests that there may be some truth to the claim.", "Lack of official confirmation": "As of the expert's verdict on September 18, 2018, neither Coca-Cola nor Aurora Cannabis had confirmed any plans or talks on the record. This lack of official confirmation leaves the claim unproven, but the presence of reports, insider confirmation, and the companies' statements indicate the possibility of authenticity."}
