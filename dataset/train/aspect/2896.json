{"The Bureau of Labor Statistics data on average weekly earnings": "The expert mentions that figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers have risen by 2.5% in \"real\" terms during President Trump's first 35 months in office. This counters Biden's claim that only the wealthy are doing well in the current economy.", "Study on CEO compensation": "The expert cites a study conducted by ISS Analytics for the Harvard Law School's Forum on Corporate Governance, which found that the median compensation of CEOs of S&P 600 corporations rose by 95% between 2009 and 2018, while median worker pay rose only 20%. This supports the argument that those at the top are gaining faster, but it contradicts Biden's claim that only the wealthy are doing well.", "Biden": "s own statements on the Iraq War: The expert points out that Biden initially did not oppose the war altogether and instead criticized President Bush for getting into the war too soon, with too few allies, and without a clear plan to \"win the peace.\" This challenges Biden's claim that he was in the position of making the case that it was a big mistake from the moment the war started."}
