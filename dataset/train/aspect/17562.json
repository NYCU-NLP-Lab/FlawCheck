{"The claim is based on a statement made by Gov": "Rick Perry, who vetoed House Bill 535, which dealt with the preference given to goods produced in Texas by state agencies.", "The claim is further supported by the existence of Section 2155": "444 of the state's Government Code, which clearly states that state agencies must give preference to goods produced or grown in Texas.", "The claim is also backed by a state attorney general opinion from May 4": "1981, which confirms that Texas has had purchasing preferences for products produced in the state for over 50 years.", "The legislation itself": "House Bill 535, provided a definition of \"manufactured\" goods and included a requirement for the state comptroller and state agencies to promote the purchase of Texas goods."}
