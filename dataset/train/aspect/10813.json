{"Lack of evidence": "The expert states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the U.S. military is using helicopters to spray coronavirus-killing pesticide on American communities. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Historical precedent": "The expert mentions that while there is a historical precedent for using helicopters to distribute pesticides, these efforts are aimed at limiting the populations of insects that carry diseases, not the diseases themselves. This information highlights the difference between using helicopters for mosquito control and using them to combat a virus like the coronavirus.", "Expert opinion": "The expert quotes Murray Isman, dean emeritus of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia, who dismisses the idea of using helicopters to spray pesticides against the coronavirus. Isman states that there are no pesticides that specifically target viruses, and general antimicrobials would have to be applied in unfeasible volumes.", "Government actions": "The expert mentions that President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have announced measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, such as deploying National Guard assistance and chartering flights for Americans abroad. However, these actions do not involve using helicopters to spray pesticides, indicating that the claim is not supported by official government actions."}
