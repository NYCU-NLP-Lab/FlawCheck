{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the analysis of the actual text of the Development": "Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM Act). The expert read the latest version of the act, Senate Bill 3992, to understand the eligibility criteria for undocumented residents and the process for obtaining citizenship.", "The second aspect involves examining the requirements and timeline outlined in the DREAM Act": "The expert found that the claim stating \"after two years of higher education or military service, you are eligible for citizenship\" is inaccurate. The process for obtaining citizenship under the DREAM Act is a 13-year process, involving conditional non-immigrant status, permanent residency, and finally naturalization.", "The third aspect involves consulting an immigration law expert": "Barbara Hines, who specializes in immigration at the University of Texas at Austin. Hines confirmed that the claim of the DREAM Act providing a pathway to citizenship after two years is false and that there is a significant amount of misinformation surrounding the act.", "The fourth aspect is the examination of the definition of": "extended family\" and whether the DREAM Act allows new citizens to bring their extended family to the United States. The expert found that the act does not explicitly mention extended family members, and the ability to bring family members to the United States would depend on how \"extended family\" is defined, which is not clarified in the claim."}
