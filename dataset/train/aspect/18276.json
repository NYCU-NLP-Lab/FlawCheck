{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's investigation found no evidence that Donald Trump ever posted the tweet in question or any tweet mentioning a pandemic, Obama, or McCain in 2009. This lack of evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Twitter activity in 2009": "The expert pointed out that Donald Trump joined Twitter in March 2009 and only posted 56 tweets that year, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. This limited activity further suggests that the claim of a specific tweet regarding a pandemic is unlikely.", "Comparison with H1N1 pandemic": "The expert highlighted that Trump has misleadingly compared the current COVID-19 pandemic with the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic of 2009. This comparison indicates that Trump has discussed pandemics before but not in the context mentioned in the claim.", "Circulation and timing of the fictitious tweet": "The expert noted that the bogus Trump tweet has been circulating since at least April and has been shared thousands of times on social media. This information suggests that the claim may be part of a larger misinformation campaign and should be approached with skepticism."}
