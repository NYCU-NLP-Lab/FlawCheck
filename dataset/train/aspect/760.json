{"Lack of direct evidence to support the claim": "The expert's verdict states that none of the sources provided by the Sanders campaign directly back up the claim that one out of four young black men end up in the criminal justice system. This suggests that there is a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Difficulty in obtaining accurate data": "The expert's verdict mentions that federal crime statistics often do not include breakdowns by sex, age, and race for adults, making it challenging to determine the exact number of young black men in the criminal justice system. This highlights the difficulty in obtaining accurate data to verify the claim.", "Ambiguity of the phrase": "young black men\": The expert's verdict raises the issue of ambiguity in the phrase \"young black men.\" It could refer to juveniles, men younger than 25, or men younger than 35. This ambiguity makes it unclear whether the claim refers to the likelihood of young black men ending up in the system while they are young or their likelihood in the future.", "Changing incarceration rates": "The expert's verdict mentions that the imprisonment rates of black men have declined since 2003, which lends more credence to the claim made by Sanders. This aspect suggests that while the claim may not have direct evidence, the overall trend of declining imprisonment rates supports the idea that a significant number of young black men do end up in the criminal justice system."}
