{"The spokesperson for San Diego Zoo Global": "Andrew James, confirmed that the leopard cub's mother did not die and that the cub came from the Nashville Zoo. This statement directly contradicts the claim that the cub's mother was killed by a trophy hunter.", "The photo of the leopard cub sitting on a person": "s lap, which was shared on Facebook, was found to be a mirror image of pictures posted on social media by the San Diego Zoo. This suggests that the image used to support the claim is not original and has been misrepresented.", "The text accompanying the photo on Facebook urges people to spread it everywhere in order to ban trophy hunting forever": "This appeal to emotions and the call for action may indicate an attempt to manipulate viewers and garner support for a cause.", "The false claim about the photo and the debunking of it by Africa Check further support the conclusion that the claim of the cub": "s mother being killed by a trophy hunter is not authentic. The involvement of fact-checking organizations adds credibility to the debunking of the claim."}
