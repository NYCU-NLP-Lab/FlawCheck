["More Info\n\n  I would like to contribute\n\n   _____________________\n   [ ] One Time\n   [ ] Monthly\n   [ ] Yearly\n   Join Now\n   Debbie Wasserman Schultz\n   stated on June 5, 2011 in an interview with political commentator Roland\n   Martin:\n   By advocating new requirements for voters to show ID cards at the polls,\n   Republicans \"want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws.\"", "For this reason, we thought a historical comparison of Jim Crow laws and\n   today\u2019s voter-identification laws would be of interest to readers (and to\n   us).", "\"Unlike with Jim Crow laws, there are ways voters can avoid this loss of\n   voting rights,\" said Rob Richie, the executive director of FairVote, a\n   non-partisan group that works to expand voter turnout and improve how\n   elections are run.", "Today, invoking the term Jim Crow in a policy debate seems like an\n   unnecessarily broad -- not to mention provocative -- way for Wasserman\n   Schultz to make her case against voter ID laws."]
