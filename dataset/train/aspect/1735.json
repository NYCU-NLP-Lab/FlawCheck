{"In some states": "Trump initially led, but Biden later surged back to take the lead, while in other states, Biden led and Trump came from behind to take the lead. This variation in the race's leaders is a normal part of the tabulation process.", "The allegation of": "surprise ballot dumps\" is false. Election officials had been warning about delays in counting for months, and the process of counting mail-in ballots takes longer, especially due to the high number of mail-in ballots during the pandemic.", "The claim that the states where Trump was leading were all controlled by Democrats is incorrect": "Different states and even counties within a state have different rules for tabulating ballots, and the order in which ballots were counted correlated with how they were cast (mail-in vs. in-person).", "While Trump may have a point about polling being inaccurate": "it is not directly related to the claim of leading in Democrat-controlled states. The accuracy of polling is a separate issue that would require further analysis."}
