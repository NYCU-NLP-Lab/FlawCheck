{"Comparison of job creation and unemployment rates": "The expert's verdict mentions that Governor Rick Scott has created close to 300,000 jobs and brought down the unemployment rate to a three/four year low. In contrast, it is stated that under Charlie Crist's tenure, over 800,000 jobs were lost and unemployment increased from about 3 percent to over 11 percent. These statistics were used to verify the claim about the difference in economic performance between the two governors.", "Examination of state debt": "The expert's verdict highlights the comparison of state debt under both governors. It is mentioned that Rick Scott has paid down the debt in Florida by about $2 billion, while Charlie Crist's debt went up by about $5 billion. The expert's analysis included reviewing the state debt accumulated during the Crist years and using the most recent Debt Affordability Report to show the total outstanding debt over recent fiscal years.", "Evaluation of budget control and spending": "The expert's verdict mentions that some experts consulted for the analysis believed that a better way to compare debt between governors is by examining the budgets over which the governor actually had control to veto spending. It is stated that Crist's debt growth should be assessed from FY 2008 to FY 2011, as those were the budgets he signed during his tenure. This aspect of budget control and spending was considered to provide a more accurate assessment of the debt increase under Charlie Crist.", "Consideration of different methods and perspectives": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that there are different ways to count the debt and assign responsibility for it. It is mentioned that the analysis took into account various perspectives and consulted experts to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the claim. This aspect of considering different methods and perspectives adds credibility to the authenticity verification process."}
