{"Lack of evidence": "The expert states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Socrates said, \"When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers.\" This suggests that the authenticity of the quote is questionable.", "Historical context": "The expert explains that Socrates did not write anything himself, and our understanding of him is based on the writings of others, such as Plato and Xenophon. These writings do mention slander, but not in the context of lost debates. This provides historical context that contradicts the claim.", "Alternative explanations": "The expert highlights that in Plato's \"Apology,\" Socrates attributes slander against him to his efforts to find men smarter than himself, rather than the outcome of lost debates. This suggests that the quote in question does not align with Socrates' beliefs and teachings.", "Internet origin": "The expert mentions that the supposed Socratic saying originates from the internet, not from any reputable source or textbook. This raises doubts about the reliability and authenticity of the quote."}
