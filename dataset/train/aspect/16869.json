{"Reverse image search": "The authenticity of the claim was verified by conducting a reverse image search, which led to the original version of the photo published in a November 2017 article by Afrikaans newspaper Rapport. This confirmed that the image had been doctored.", "Interview with the original subject": "The man pictured in the original photo, Ruan Lottering, was interviewed by AFP Fact Check. He explained that the woman's outfit was a joke and that neither he nor the woman supported the old regime or the old flag. This interview provided insight into the context of the photo.", "Facebook search": "A search on Facebook using the search term \"Madonsela de Klerk\" led to a post from the FW de Klerk Foundation's official Facebook page. The post showed de Klerk presenting Madonsela with an award for her public service. This confirmed that the faces of Madonsela and de Klerk in the \"apartheid dress\" image were taken from a different photo.", "Legal context": "The expert's verdict mentioned a landmark ruling by a Johannesburg court that barred the unjustified display of the old apartheid flag, considering it \"hate speech\" and \"harassment.\" This legal context provided additional evidence against the authenticity of the claim."}
