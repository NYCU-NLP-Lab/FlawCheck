{"Statements by Democratic politicians": "The expert mentions that Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and President Barack Obama have all made claims about Republicans agreeing with 80 percent or more of the health care bill. This shows that the claim has been made by multiple prominent Democratic figures.", "Lack of evidence from Republicans": "The expert conducted a search through news coverage, transcripts, and news releases to find instances of Republicans invoking the 80 percent figure. However, they were unable to find substantial evidence supporting this claim. This suggests that Republicans may not have made this argument as frequently as Democrats have claimed.", "Unclear reference to specific bill": "The expert notes that Wasserman Schultz referred to agreeing \"with 80 percent of what's in our bill,\" which could be interpreted as referring to the bill in her own chamber, the House. However, it is difficult to determine which specific Democratic proposals Republicans may have been referring to when discussing agreement on 80 percent of the bill.", "Democratic strategy to highlight common ground": "The expert mentions that Democrats may have a strategic motive for emphasizing bipartisan agreement on the health care bill. By highlighting the 80 percent figure, Democrats may be trying to portray Republicans as obstructionists and themselves as willing to compromise. This suggests that the claim could be influenced by political tactics rather than a completely objective assessment of agreement on the bill."}
