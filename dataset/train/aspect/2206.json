{"The claim is supported by multiple news sources": "including Politico, TIME, CNBC, New York Daily News, and HuffPost, who all reported on Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund's figure of 18 school shootings in the U.S. in 2018.", "Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund": "the source of the claim, is an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that aims to prevent gun violence. They have a broad definition of school shootings, which includes incidents where no one was injured, attempted or completed suicides, unintentional firings resulting in injury or death, and incidents on college campuses.", "The expert notes that the 18 incidents counted by Everytown include dramatically different situations than the Florida school shooting": "such as gunshots fired from off-campus hitting a building window with no injuries, shots fired at students in a parking lot with no injuries, unintentional firing in a classroom resulting in two student injuries, and a mass shooting with 17 deaths.", "The expert also mentions that while mass shootings do occur in other countries": "they do not happen with the same frequency as in the United States, further emphasizing the distinction between the claim and the specific incident in Florida."}
