{"The presence of police officers": "The claim asserts that the video shows police at the U.S. Capitol opening \"gates\" to allow rioters in. The expert's analysis verifies the presence of police officers in the video wearing uniforms marked as \"U.S. Capitol Police.\"", "Movement of barricades": "The expert's analysis mentions that it was indiscernible from the footage whether police or the extremists moved the barricades. The video shows a brief moment where a crowd of rioters pushed past the waist-high gates, suggesting that the barricades were breached.", "Actions of the police officers": "The expert's verdict states that after the breach, the footage shows U.S. Capitol police officers slowly walking away from the breached access point without making any visible or forceful attempts to block the rioters from entering. This suggests a lack of resistance from the police officers.", "Confirmation from the original creator": "The expert tracked down the original creator of the TikTok video, freelance journalist Marcus DiPaola, who confirmed that the video was indeed posted by him and showed a group pushing Capitol police. This confirmation adds authenticity to the claim."}
