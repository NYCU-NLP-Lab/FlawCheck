{"The claim states that Dan Patrick changed his name from Danny Goeb to hide from his debts": "The expert's verdict confirms that Dan Patrick did legally change his name from Dannie Scott Goeb to Dan Patrick, but it was not done to hide from his debts. The name change occurred years after his bankruptcy filing and after he had already established himself with the name Dan Patrick in his broadcasting and political career.", "The expert": "s investigation found that Patrick's bankruptcy case records indicate that he was released from all dischargeable debts in May 1987. This suggests that the claim of hiding from debts through a name change is not factually supported.", "News stories dating back to Patrick": "s first Senate campaign in 2006 confirm that he had been using the name Dan Patrick professionally for decades before legally changing his name in the fall of 2003. This further supports the fact that the name change was not related to hiding from debts but rather for professional reasons."}
