{"The claim is attributed to Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn": "who made the statement during a public forum at Marquette University Law School.", "The claim is based on the point system in juvenile court": "where a stolen car counts as zero points and does not result in the juvenile being held for any period of time.", "The claim is supported by statistics provided by the Milwaukee police": "which show that juveniles accounted for 39 percent of the suspects arrested for auto theft and auto theft-related crimes in 2014.", "The claim is further supported by the Milwaukee police policy": "which states that all juveniles arrested for auto theft or operating a vehicle without the owner's consent are taken to the county Juvenile Justice Center, indicating that the claim of juveniles being sent home is not automatic."}
