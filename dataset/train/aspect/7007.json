{"The image of the tweet": "The expert mentions that the claim is based on an image that went viral, purporting to show a tweet made by Ted Cruz in 2016. The image is described to have the profile picture and blue checkmark matching Cruz's official Twitter profile.", "Lack of matching tweets": "The expert states that a search for the purported climate change tweet on Cruz's personal Twitter account (@tedcruz) and his official Twitter page (@SenTedCruz) results in no matches. This suggests that the tweet in question does not exist in Cruz's tweet history.", "Absence from tweet archives": "The expert mentions that the tweet does not appear in archived versions of Cruz's Twitter page from September 2016 using the Internet Wayback Machine. This further supports the notion that the tweet is not authentic.", "Confirmation from Cruz": "s communication advisor: Steve Guest, a communication advisor for Cruz, confirmed in an email to Factcheck.org that the tweet is fabricated. While the expert was unable to reach Cruz's office for comment, this confirmation adds weight to the claim's inauthenticity."}
