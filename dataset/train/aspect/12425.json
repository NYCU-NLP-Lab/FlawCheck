{"The claim was made by Gov": "Eric Greitens during a speech where he announced his recommended budget for fiscal year 2018. This provides the context in which the claim was made.", "Greitens cited specific numbers to support his claim": "stating that K-12 education funding increased from $5,914,000,000 to $5,951,000,000. This provides quantitative evidence to verify the claim.", "The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education": "s budget for FY 2018, as proposed by Greitens, does show an increase in total funding compared to FY 2017. This verifies that the claim is accurate in terms of total funding.", "However": "upon closer examination, it was found that the actual percentage increase in funding for K-12 education was 0.613 percent, not the 4.1 percent claimed by Greitens. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the claim and the source of the 4.1 percent figure."}
