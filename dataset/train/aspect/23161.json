{"The claim was investigated by examining the sources that published the article": "The expert found that the claim originated from clickbait factories and fake news sites with names like \"trumpphotos.blogspot.com,\" \"americanews2018.blogspot.com,\" and \"thedailytrumpnews.us.\" These sources are known for spreading false information and sensationalized headlines.", "The expert analyzed the language and tone used in the claim": "They noted that the language seemed exaggerated and sensationalized, with phrases like \"I would say 'f*ck you' to all of them\" and \"Just go to hell all of you!\" This raised suspicions about the authenticity of the claim, as it seemed unlikely for a public figure like Tom Selleck to use such strong language in endorsing a political candidate.", "The expert compared the claim to known statements made by Tom Selleck": "They found no evidence of Selleck publicly endorsing Donald Trump or making any political statements of this nature. This inconsistency further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "The expert identified that the words attributed to Tom Selleck in the claim were actually lifted from a real Hollywood actor": "Jon Voight, who endorsed Trump in 2016. This discovery revealed that the claim was a misattribution, as Selleck never conducted an interview with Breitbart News or made any statements endorsing Trump in the manner described in the claim."}
