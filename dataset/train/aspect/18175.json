{"The claim is based on a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee": "NRCC), which states that Scott Wallace \"wants to tax families of five for \u2018irresponsible breeding.\u2019\" This is the initial source of the claim.", "The NRCC Regional Press Secretary": "Chris Martin, cited a Fox News article from July that reported on the Wallace Global Fund's donations to groups advocating population control. This article provides evidence of the foundation's support for population control and their donations to a group called Zero Population Growth (now known as Population Connection), which advocated for families with more than two children to be \"taxed to the hilt\" for \"irresponsible breeding.\"", "Wallace": "s spokesperson, Zoe Wilson-Meyer, confirmed that Wallace inherited the foundation from his parents after the donations were made. While the foundation's tax form for that year listed Wallace as \"president,\" internal meeting minutes show he was elected to that position in December 2013. This information establishes Wallace's connection to the foundation and his involvement in its activities.", "It is clear that Wallace supports the aims of groups seeking to stabilize population growth through voluntary family planning": "as his late father was co-chairman of Population Action International, which aligns with the goals of population control organizations. This supports the claim that Wallace is in favor of population control measures, including potentially taxing families with more than two children."}
