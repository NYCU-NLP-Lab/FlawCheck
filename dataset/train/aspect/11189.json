{"Comparison of average GM employee wages": "The expert compared the claim that the average GM employee could pay for a year of college tuition in two weeks' wages to historical wage data from the auto industry in the 1960s. They found that the average hourly wage in the auto industry at that time was about $3.01, which would amount to $285.20 for a two-week period.", "Average cost of college tuition in 1965": "The expert also looked at data from the U.S. Education Department to determine the average cost of college tuition in the 1965-66 school year. They found that the average undergraduate tuition and fees for a four-year college was $607 per year, and $203 for a two-year college.", "Calculation of wages needed to pay for college tuition": "Based on the average GM employee wages and the average cost of college tuition, the expert calculated that two weeks of average GM pay would have been enough to pay for one year at a typical two-year college in 1965. However, it would not have been enough to pay for a year at a typical four-year college, which would have required a little more than four weeks' work.", "Source of wage data": "The expert noted that the O'Malley campaign obtained the wage number from a column by economist Robert Reich, who also served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. This indicates that the claim's authenticity was verified by referencing a reputable source."}
