{"Number of visitors": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim made by Sen. Richard Pan about the number of visitors to the California State Capitol building sounded dubious. To verify the claim, the expert examined the number of visitors inside the building and found that it attracts roughly one million visitors annually.", "Comparison with Disneyland": "The claim states that the California State Capitol building is \"second only to Disneyland\" among visitor sites in the state. The expert set out to examine whether this comparison is accurate and found that the Capitol attracts approximately 1.1 million visitors inside and outside the building annually, which suggests that it could potentially rival Disneyland in terms of visitors.", "Permitted events": "The expert also considered the number of permitted events that take place on the Capitol grounds each year. While the California Highway Patrol, which administers the permits, does not keep data on the number of attendees, it was estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 people attend these events annually. This aspect adds to the overall visitor count and supports the claim's comparison with Disneyland.", "Missing fire sprinklers": "As part of the verification process, the expert mentions a statement made by Sen. Richard Pan about the absence of fire sprinklers in the Capitol building despite the high number of visitors. This aspect highlights a potential safety concern and reinforces the notion that the Capitol attracts a significant number of visitors."}
