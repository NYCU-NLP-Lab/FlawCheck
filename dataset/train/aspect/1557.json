{"Discrepancy in camera placement": "The expert pointed out that the position of the security camera shown in the ghost footage did not match the actual location of the school's security camera. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the video.", "Inconsistent visibility of picture frames": "The expert noted that the picture frames along the wall were clearly visible in the ghost footage, even though they should have been obscured or hidden if the video was genuinely captured by the school's security camera. This inconsistency suggested that the footage was manipulated.", "Lack of evidence for supernatural occurrences": "Despite the eerie claims made by the school's deputy principal and the video's popularity, the expert highlighted the absence of any concrete evidence supporting the presence of ghosts. This lack of substantiation undermined the credibility of the claim.", "Possible human involvement": "The expert concluded that the most plausible explanation for the video was clever editing and human intervention. The mention of a tripod setup in the middle of the hallway indicated that the footage was likely created by individuals rather than being a genuine paranormal encounter."}
