{"The trade deficit between the United States and the European Union was": "93 billion, not $100 billion to $150 billion, as claimed by the President. This information was verified using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "Defense spending by NATO member countries did not decrease before Trump took office": "In fact, NATO Europe and Canada had increased their defense spending in 2015 and 2016. This was confirmed by the most recent NATO report on defense spending.", "The claim that many countries are": "delinquent\" in their NATO payments is misleading. Each country decides its own defense spending as a percentage of its GDP and does not owe money to NATO if it spends less than other member countries.", "The President": "s statement that defense spending for NATO members was \"going down for close to 20 years\" is not supported by the NATO report on defense spending. The report shows that spending declined in the 1990s, but has been rising or staying level since then, with a decline only from 2009 to 2014."}
