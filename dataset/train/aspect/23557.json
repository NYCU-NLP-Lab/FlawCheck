{"Historical evidence": "The expert mentioned the Austin American-Statesman news article from January 2009, which stated that Joe Straus appeared poised to become \"the first Jewish speaker of the Texas House since statehood.\" This historical evidence suggests that there were no Jewish speakers before Straus.", "Lack of evidence for previous Jewish speakers": "The expert also mentioned that historians have found no evidence that David Kaufman, who served as speaker of the House in the Congress of the Republic of Texas from 1839 to 1841, was a practicing Jew or received a Jewish burial. This lack of evidence supports the claim that Joe Straus is the first Jewish speaker.", "Testimony from a rabbi": "Rabbi Jimmy Kessler of Temple B\u2019nai Israel in Galveston stated that usually a person of the Jewish faith would be buried in a Jewish cemetery. This testimony supports the claim that Joe Straus, being Jewish, would likely be buried in a Jewish cemetery.", "Expert opinion": "Bryan Stone, an associate history professor and author of the book \"The Chosen Folks,\" confirmed that there have been many Jewish members of the Texas Legislature but stated that Straus is definitely the first Jewish speaker. This expert opinion adds weight to the claim's authenticity."}
