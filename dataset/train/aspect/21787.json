The fact that these practices have been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court indicates their legality and undermines the claim of \"big problems and discrepancies\" with mail-in ballots.", "Increased use of mail": "in ballots due to COVID-19: The expert notes that concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a significant increase in the use of mail-in ballots. This aspect highlights the valid reasons for the surge in mail-in voting and suggests that the extended counting process is a result of the unprecedented circumstances rather than any fraudulent activity."}
