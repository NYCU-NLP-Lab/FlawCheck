{"The claim originated from a junk news site called News Punch": "formerly Your News Wire), known for publishing unreliable information.", "The News Punch article was based on a story published by the Daily Mail": "which in turn was based on an article from Australia's Daily Telegraph. However, the original article from the Daily Telegraph has apparently been deleted, raising questions about its credibility.", "Legitimate news outlets did not report on Australia introducing 33 new genders on government forms and documents": "In fact, the Australian Labor Party had proposed removing gender from birth certificates and passports, a proposal that was rejected by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.", "The idea of": "33 genders\" likely originated from a 2016 survey conducted by the Queensland University of Technology, which offered respondents 33 different choices to describe their gender. However, not all of these choices represented distinct genders, as some were descriptive terms or duplicative concepts."}
