{"The context of the statement": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim was taken out of context from a broader statement made by Ilhan Omar during a February 2018 interview with Al Jazeera English. This context is crucial in understanding the intended meaning of her words.", "Clarification of the intended meaning": "The expert's verdict explains that Omar was not suggesting the wholesale fear of white men as a group. Instead, she was pointing out the disproportionate focus on the Muslim community in anti-terror policies, despite the fact that right-wing extremist men have been responsible for the majority of deadly domestic terrorism acts in recent years.", "Manipulation of the video": "The expert's verdict mentions that an edited video of Omar's comments was spread across right-leaning media, making it appear as if she called for wholesale fear and surveillance of white men. This manipulation of the video distorted the original message and created a false impression.", "Pattern of misrepresentation": "The expert's verdict highlights that this edited video clip follows a pattern of either taking snippets out of previous interviews or inventing incendiary comments and attributing them to Omar. This pattern suggests a deliberate effort to misrepresent her views and incite controversy."}
