{"Sanders": "plan, known as the American Health Security Act of 2013, does disrupt the current health insurance system by stripping insurance benefits from the Affordable Care Act, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Medicare, and Medicaid. However, it does not give Republican governors the power to take away individual's health insurance.", "The primary administrators of the system under Sanders": "plan would be the states. Each state would be required to set up the specifics of their health care system, but they must meet federal standards. If a state fails to set up a system or refuses to meet the federal standards, the federal government will step in and run that state's program.", "While Clinton": "s assertion that Republican governors could take away health insurance is misleading, it is true that states would have control over their own health care systems under Sanders' plan. This aspect of state-based administration is consistent with Clinton's claim, although the claim itself is inaccurate in terms of empowering Republican governors to take away health insurance."}
