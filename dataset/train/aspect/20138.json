{"The claim was initially made by actor Ajaz Khan on Twitter": "who posted a photograph of an injured man and claimed he was Abu Kamil, a Muslim teacher in Mahua, Bihar who was beaten up by a mob. This claim was then further propagated by Prashant Patel Umrao, a Twitter user with a significant following.", "Prashant Patel Umrao alleged that Abu Kamil had raped a girl and was beaten up by members of his own community": "This allegation was supported by ShankhNaad, a popular handle known for posting misinformation of communal nature on Facebook.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking website, investigated the incident and found tweets from social media users who had uploaded a video clip of a news report by Aaj Tak, a prominent Indian news channel. The report stated that Abu Kamil, also known as Shadab, was forced into a car, robbed, beaten up, and then thrown out of the car. When people from a nearby village saw him injured, they mistook him for a thief and thrashed him. The police later rescued him and admitted him to the hospital.", "Alt News could not find any other news reports about the incident": "suggesting that the Aaj Tak report was the only media-related information available. This lack of additional sources raises questions about the veracity of Prashant Patel Umrao's claim that Abu Kamil had raped a girl and was beaten up by his own community members."}
