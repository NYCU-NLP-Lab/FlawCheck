{"Discrepancy in the number of middle": "class families: The expert found a significant difference between the claim that 400,000 middle-class Rhode Island families would see their federal income taxes increase and the actual number of households with families in Rhode Island, which was 256,181. This raised doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Inclusion of non": "middle-class families: The expert discovered that not all of the 256,181 families in Rhode Island could be classified as middle-class. A portion of these families had incomes below the federal poverty level, which further questioned the validity of the claim.", "Lack of a clear definition of middle class": "The expert noted that there is no official definition of the middle class, and people from various income levels consider themselves to be part of this category. This ambiguity makes it challenging to accurately assess the impact on middle-class families.", "Universal impact of tax changes": "The expert pointed out that regardless of whether individuals are considered middle class or not, if a deal is not reached, everyone who already pays taxes will be affected. This implies that the claim's focus solely on middle-class families may be misleading."}
