{"The claim is based on a 2004 U": "S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report that stated work-related traffic fatalities had increased by 72 percent. The report does not directly attribute this increase to employees and drivers who could not read or understand warning signs in English.", "The campaign cites an article from the September 23": "2004, Birmingham News as the source of information about the BLS report. However, the article only mentions speculation by a Department of Labor economist, Victoria Dinkins, who suggested that the language barrier for Hispanic workers could play a role in increased on-the-job fatalities in Alabama.", "The BLS report in question is actually a 2003 report on fatal occupational injuries in Alabama": "not a nationwide report as claimed by the campaign. The report does not mention anything about accidents being tied to an inability to read signs in English. It is important to note that the BLS does not track this specific information.", "The expert": "s investigation found no direct evidence or data in the BLS report to support the claim made by the campaign. The claim appears to be based on speculation and misinterpretation of the report by the campaign, rather than verifiable facts."}
