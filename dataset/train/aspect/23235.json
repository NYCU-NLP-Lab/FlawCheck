{"The COVID": "19 tests are not rigged and do not produce false positives. There is no evidence to suggest that labs are deliberately manipulating test results.", "The death count from COVID": "19 is not false. It is currently at about 187,000 in the United States and rising. There may even be an undercount of COVID-19 cases in the country.", "Wearing masks can reduce the transmission of COVID": "19. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of the virus.", "The claim that weak immune systems are solely responsible for COVID": "19 deaths is not accurate. While individuals with weakened immune systems may be more susceptible to severe illness, anyone can catch COVID-19 if exposed to the virus. Other factors, such as age and underlying medical conditions, also contribute to the severity of the disease."}
