{"The bill would establish statewide rules for police body camera and dash camera footage if signed into law by Gov": "Pat McCrory.", "Open": "government advocates, including the state American Civil Liberties Union chapter, argue that the bill would give police excessive power to keep footage shielded from the public.", "ACLU attorney Susanna Birdsong stated that giving law enforcement broad authority to keep video footage secret": "even from individuals who are filmed, would damage law enforcement's ability to build trust with the public.", "The proposed law includes two ways for members of the public to view police video": "disclosure and release. Disclosure allows individuals seen or heard in the video, or their representatives, to watch it without making copies or showing it to the general public. Release, on the other hand, would require a judge's approval and allows the footage to be made publicly available for viewing or for use as evidence in lawsuits."}
