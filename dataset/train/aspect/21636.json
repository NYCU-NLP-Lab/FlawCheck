{"Lack of conclusive evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the underlying claim of young people growing \"horns\" from looking down at cellphone screens was unfounded. This suggests that there was a lack of conclusive evidence to support the claim.", "Study limitations": "The study conducted by researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia, focused on the external occipital protuberance (EOP) and its enlargement. However, the expert's verdict points out that the study lacked a control group and could not establish a cause and effect relationship. This limitation raises doubts about the validity of the claim.", "Criticisms from other publications": "Various publications, such as Gizmodo and the New York Times, criticized the research and highlighted its flaws. Gizmodo pointed out that the study only presented a hypothesis and did not prove anything, while the New York Times mentioned the absence of a control group and the specific focus on a group experiencing pain. These criticisms further cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Skepticism from experts": "The expert's verdict includes a quote from Dr. Evan Johnson, an assistant professor and director of physical therapy, who dismisses the claim as insignificant. Dr. Johnson suggests that the formation of a bone spur from straining the neck forward is possible but not a major concern. This skepticism from an expert adds weight to the argument against the claim's authenticity."}
