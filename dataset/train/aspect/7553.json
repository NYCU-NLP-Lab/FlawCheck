{"The timing of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was posted on April 3, just a day after the Bharat bandh protest on April 2. This suggests that the claim is not related to the protest.", "Historical context": "The expert's verdict states that the photograph in question was actually taken during the Jat agitation for reservation in Haryana in February 2016. This provides evidence that the claim is not recent and not related to the Bharat bandh protest.", "Previous posting of the photograph": "The expert's verdict mentions that the same photograph was posted earlier on March 10 by a different Facebook page, Nation First. This indicates that the photograph has been circulating for some time and is not directly linked to the Bharat bandh protest.", "Inconsistency with the claim": "The expert's verdict emphasizes that the claim is false and misleading. The photograph does not depict the Bharat bandh protesters setting fire to a truck owned by a Sikh, as claimed. This inconsistency further supports the conclusion that the claim is not authentic."}
