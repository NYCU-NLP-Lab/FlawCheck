Ron Maag, who argue that \"workplace freedom\" laws attract jobs.", "The claim is backed by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy": "a \"free market\" think tank, which asserts that workers in right-to-work states make more money, even when adjusting for cost of living.", "James M": "Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center, calculated the adjusted per-capita personal income using a state-by-state cost of living index and concluded that right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes.", "However": "economists from the Economic Policy Institute conducted an analysis using a regression model that controlled for more than 40 factors and found that wages in right-to-work states are 3.2 percent lower than those in non-right-to-work states for all workers, not just union members. They concluded that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less per year than a similar worker elsewhere."}
