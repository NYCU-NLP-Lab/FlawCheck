{"The presence of photos in the article": "The expert noted that the article contained three images, including one showing young people walking along a street, one of Senator Risa Hontiveros, and another of students dancing with a text overlay. The presence and authenticity of these photos were considered as evidence to verify the claim.", "Comparison with previous instances": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on Google and found that one of the photos used in the article had been circulating online since 2013, which was three years before Senator Hontiveros became a senator. This comparison helped establish that the photo was not related to the claimed incident.", "Contextual analysis of the photos": "The expert analyzed the context in which the photos were used in the article and found that they were being used in a misleading manner. This analysis helped cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Examination of related sources": "The expert referred to other sources, such as a report about Senator Hontiveros' victory published by a Philippine news organization and a Facebook post from 2018 containing the same photos and text as in the article but without a link. These sources were considered to gather additional information and cross-reference the claim."}
