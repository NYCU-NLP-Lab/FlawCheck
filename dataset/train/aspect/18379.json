{"The origins of the video are unclear": "with no information provided on where, when, or who shot the footage. The lack of concrete details raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "The video was initially shared on LiveLeak and Reddit": "but it gained more attention when it was published on YouTube by Viral Hog. The accompanying description on YouTube stated that the video was filmed in Mexico on a specific date, but this information cannot be independently verified.", "Images of a fountain located in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City were found through various sources": "including Google Maps, Alamy, and a photographer's website. These images resemble the fountain shown in the video, suggesting a potential location match.", "Skeptics questioned the authenticity of the video based on two main points": "the lack of reaction from people in the video and the strength of the water jet required to lift a child. However, it is noted that the viral version of the video is missing frames at the end, which capture an adult coming to the child's aid. Additionally, reports of children getting injured by high-pressure fountain jets lend some plausibility to the incident depicted in the video."}
