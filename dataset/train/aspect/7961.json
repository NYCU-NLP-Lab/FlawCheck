{"The Christie camp": "s claim that Bernie Sanders wants a 90 percent top marginal tax rate is not the same as a tax increase of 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer.", "None of the three Democratic candidates": "Clinton, Sanders, and O'Malley, have released formal tax plans that suggest rates as high as 70 or 80 percent.", "Analysis by the Tax Foundation": "Tax Policy Center, and independent research shows that the Democrats' proposals involve raising the top marginal income tax rate, capital gains and dividends tax rates, estate tax rate, and payroll tax, but none of these changes indicate rates as high as Christie claimed.", "Experts and analysts": "including Scott Greenberg from the Tax Foundation and Roberton Williams from the Tax Policy Center, agree that it is unlikely for the Democratic candidates to levy very high rates on the median American household."}
