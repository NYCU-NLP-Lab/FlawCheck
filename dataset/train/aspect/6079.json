This suggests that the claim is being presented as one of the mayor's achievements and adds credibility to the authenticity of the claim.", "Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos provided a report full of statistics that included felony crime totals from 1960 to 2010": "as well as felony crime totals for 2011 and 2012. The annual totals from this report matched the claim made by Mayor Reed, indicating that the claim is based on official data and not just a subjective statement.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that police departments across the country have reported a drop in crime in recent years. This aligns with the claim and provides a broader context for understanding the decrease in felony crimes in Atlanta. The fact that this trend is not unique to Atlanta adds credibility to the claim and suggests that it is part of a larger national trend."}
