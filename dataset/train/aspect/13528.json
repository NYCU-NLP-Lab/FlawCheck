{"The claim was initially shared on a Facebook page called Wise Indian Tongue": "WIT on May 3, 2019. This page claimed that Shabana Azmi said, \"I will leave the country if Narendra Modi wins and again become the Prime Minister!!! \u2013 Shabana Azmi!!\" The post received over 2,000 likes and 800 shares.", "The alleged statement made by Azmi was also shared by an individual user named Shashank Gupta on the group DR": "SAMBIT PATRA FANS CLUB on May 4. This indicates that the claim was further spread by multiple users on social media platforms.", "The claim gained more traction when it was shared in the form of a meme featuring Azmi and Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan": "The meme was shared by a page called Bharat Vikas \u2013 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0938, which has over 2 lakh followers. Another page called I Support PM also shared the statement with the caption, \"Like Shabana Azmi, Shahrukh Khan will also leave the country on May 23.\" These posts received thousands of shares and likes, suggesting that many social media users believed the claim to be true.", "Alt News": "a fact-checking organization, contacted Shabana Azmi directly to verify the claim. Azmi denied making any such statement and called it a \"pure fabrication.\" She expressed her contempt for the spread of fake news and emphasized her commitment to India, stating, \"This is where I was born and this is where I will die.\" Azmi's denial, along with the lack of any news reports supporting the claim, further undermines the authenticity of the statement attributed to her."}
