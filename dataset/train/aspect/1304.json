{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that there is no concrete evidence or proof provided in the claim to support the existence of a new home invasion technique involving rubber bands and door handles. The claim is solely based on a Facebook post without any additional supporting information.", "Inefficiency and impracticality": "The expert highlights the impracticality and inefficiency of the described method. The scenario presented in the claim suggests that a thief would wait outside a locked door with a rubber band on the handle, which is considered a conspicuous and inefficient approach. The expert questions the advantage of using a rubber band instead of simply holding the latch handle down with the thumb.", "Alternative explanations": "The expert offers alternative explanations for the presence of a rubber band on the door handle. They suggest that it could be a result of a harmless or unrelated incident rather than a deliberate attempt at home invasion. This challenges the authenticity of the claim and raises doubts about its validity.", "Lack of credibility": "The expert questions the credibility of the claim by highlighting the lack of supporting evidence or expert opinions. They mention that while some techniques involving rubber bands and locks have been demonstrated, there is skepticism regarding the specific method described in the Facebook post. The absence of credible sources or expert validation undermines the authenticity of the claim."}
