{"Multiple news sources reported on the": "female impersonator\" comment: The expert's verdict mentions that USA Today, Time, and NPR all ran news stories or opinion pieces in 1993 that described the gender-based attacks on Kay Bailey Hutchison, including the comment made by Gloria Steinem. This indicates that the claim was widely reported and not just based on a single source.", "The comment was mentioned in a 1993 opinion column": "The expert's verdict cites an opinion column from the Orange County Register that provides a fuller version of the quotation, stating that Hutchison was called \"a female impersonator ... someone who looks like us but thinks like them.\" This additional context helps verify the authenticity of the claim.", "The comment was made during a visit by Gloria Steinem": "The expert's verdict mentions that Steinem made the remark during a visit to Dallas on behalf of Bob Krueger, who was running against Hutchison in a special election runoff for the U.S. Senate in 1993. This specific event helps establish the time and place of the comment, adding credibility to the claim.", "The Dallas Morning News archives corroborate the remark": "The expert's verdict states that Wayne Slater, a senior political writer for the Dallas Morning News, searched the newspaper's archives and found a May 23, 1993, news story that reports Steinem calling Hutchison \"a female impersonator.\" This archival evidence from a reputable newspaper provides further verification of the claim."}
