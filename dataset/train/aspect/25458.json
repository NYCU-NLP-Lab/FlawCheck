{"The original tweet by the official Twitter handle of Maharastra Information Centre": "which depicted the purported images of National Maritime Museum, Mumbai, could not be found on their timeline.", "A year": "old tweet by Maha Info Centre was found with the same narrative and image as seen in the screenshot of the deleted tweet, indicating a possible discrepancy.", "The images in question had the Union Jack": "the national flag of the United Kingdom, hoisted on the top of the building, which is not consistent with the National Maritime Museum in Mumbai.", "Reverse searching the image on Google revealed that it is representative of the National Maritime Museum in London": "not Mumbai. Multiple websites and social media pages have also falsely claimed the image to be of the Mumbai museum."}
