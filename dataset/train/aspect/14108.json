{"Lack of police reports": "Local police in the Canadian city where the claim originated stated that there have been no reports of sex traffickers using the zip-tie contraption described in the claim. This suggests that there is no evidence to support the claim.", "Non": "identification by nonprofit organizations: Nonprofit organizations working to combat human trafficking have not identified the zip-tie method as a trend. This indicates that experts in the field have not observed or encountered this specific method being used by sex traffickers.", "Lack of evidence in news archives": "A search of news archives for reports of sex traffickers using zip ties did not yield any record of the contraption described in the social media posts. This further supports the notion that the claim lacks substantial evidence.", "Police response and FBI silence": "The local police in Burnaby, Canada, where the claim originated, stated that they were unable to find any report or investigation that fits the criminal activity described in the posts. Additionally, the FBI declined to comment on whether incidents involving the zip-tie contraption had occurred in the United States. These responses suggest a lack of substantiation for the claim."}
