{"Lack of credible complaints": "The expert's verdict states that there have been no credible complaints of voter fraud in Orange County following the midterm elections. This aspect indicates that there is no substantial evidence or reports supporting the claim of voter fraud.", "Inaccurate calculation of vote totals": "The expert highlights that the story posted on Gateway Pundit incorrectly calculated the vote totals. By adding up the votes cast for Democratic congressional candidates in Orange County and subtracting the votes cast for the Democratic candidate for governor, the claim of 300,000 more votes for congressional seats than for governor is proven to be inaccurate.", "Insufficient evidence provided": "The claim made by Gateway Pundit lacks any supporting evidence to back up the assertion of voter fraud. The expert's verdict mentions that the story offered no evidence to support the claim, indicating a lack of substantiation.", "Possibility of split votes": "The expert's analysis reveals that the difference between the total votes cast for Democratic congressional candidates by Orange County voters and the votes cast for the Democratic candidate for governor is 37,027, not 300,000 as claimed. This suggests that a significant number of voters may have split their votes between parties, indicating a possible explanation for the difference in vote totals."}
