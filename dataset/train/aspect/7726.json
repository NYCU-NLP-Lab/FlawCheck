This acknowledgment adds to the credibility of the claim as it suggests that the photographs were not fabricated with detailed information.", "Comparison to known snake species": "The expert explains that the snake in the photographs was initially identified as a \"sharp-nosed viper\" but clarifies that there is no snake known as a \"pico jackfruit snake.\" Instead, they suggest that it may refer to a bushmaster snake, which is a venomous pit-viper found in South America. This comparison helps verify the claim by establishing a connection to a known snake species.", "Expert opinion on the severity of the snakebite": "The expert quotes Brian Fry, an associate professor in the school of biological sciences at the University of Queensland, who explains the destructive nature of the venom of the identified snake species.
