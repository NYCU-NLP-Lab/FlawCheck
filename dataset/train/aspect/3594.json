{"The claim originated from an article published by The Huffington Post": "which is known for its satirical content. The inclusion of a disclaimer at the beginning of the article indicated that it was a satirical piece.", "The content of the claim itself": "stating that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered the flattening of all classroom globes, is highly unlikely and goes against scientific consensus.", "The language used in the claim": "such as the reference to the Earth being \"flattened like God made it just 6,000 years ago,\" is exaggerated and sensationalized, further suggesting a satirical nature.", "The presence of other satirical articles and instances of confusion in the past": "both by The Huffington Post and other media outlets, highlights the need for caution when interpreting their content."}
