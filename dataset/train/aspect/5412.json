{"Inspections of abortion centers": "The expert's verdict mentions that inspections have been conducted at abortion centers in Virginia. These inspections are aimed at ensuring compliance with state laws, including parental consent laws for abortions on minors.", "Violations of parental consent laws": "The expert's verdict states that these inspections have found multiple violations of state parental consent laws. This suggests that some abortion centers have not been following the requirement of obtaining notarized permission from a parent or legal guardian, or an order from a judge, before performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor.", "Inaction by Gov": "Terry McAuliffe: The expert's verdict claims that Gov. Terry McAuliffe and his administration have done nothing in response to the violations of parental consent laws. This implies that the state government has not taken any action to address the non-compliance of abortion centers with these laws.", "Alleged political motivations": "The expert's verdict mentions that the accusations made by the president of the Family Foundation, Victoria Cobb, suggest that Gov. McAuliffe's inaction is motivated by his ties to the \"abortion industry\" and the financial support he received from abortion rights groups during his campaign. This aspect suggests a possible political motive behind the alleged lack of enforcement of abortion laws."}
