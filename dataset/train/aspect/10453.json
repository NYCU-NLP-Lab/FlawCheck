{"Statement from Canadian government spokesman": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from R\u00e9mi Larivi\u00e8re, a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), who explicitly denies the claim and states that Canada plans on welcoming about 341,000 immigrants in 2020, not 3 million.", "Immigration plan details": "The expert's verdict mentions that the IRCC has defined its immigration target in its 2019-2021 plan, which outlines a gradual increase in the number of accepted permanent residents. This plan specifies that the target for 2020 is 350,000 immigrants, further contradicting the claim of 3 million.", "Categories of immigration focus": "The expert's verdict highlights that the largest part of the increase in immigration will be granted to economic immigrants, particularly skilled workers, which aligns with the IRCC's plan. This information further supports the assertion that the claim of 3 million immigrants is not accurate.", "Source credibility and history": "The expert's verdict mentions that the article making the claim was published on four different websites with visually similar layouts. It also notes that AFP FactCheck has debunked two of these websites in the past. Additionally, it highlights that the Facebook page associated with one of the websites has administrators in Kosovo, raising questions about the credibility of the source. This information suggests that the claim may be unreliable due to the questionable sources behind it."}
