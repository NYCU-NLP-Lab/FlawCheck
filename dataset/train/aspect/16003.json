{"The claim states that studies in other countries show that young children do not seem to spread the virus and don": "t get sick. However, the expert's verdict points out that questions remain about how frequently kids transmit the coronavirus to others.", "The expert also mentions that the countries where children have returned to classrooms had much less ongoing community transmission than many places in the U": "S. currently have. This suggests that the situation in those countries may not be directly applicable to the U.S.", "The expert acknowledges that there is some evidence suggesting that children": "especially younger children, may spread the virus less than adults. However, the transmission studies often include children who were more sheltered than usual, so there are lingering questions about the potential increase in transmission within the community and to school teachers and staff.", "The expert emphasizes that while less is known about infection and transmission in children": "the evidence is consistent in showing that children are at extremely low risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19. The case fatality rates for children are much lower compared to all ages. However, the expert also mentions the possibility of long-term or chronic effects of COVID-19 infection in children."}
