{"Verification from official sources": "The expert's verdict includes statements from representatives of the BfArM (Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) and the PEI (Paul Ehrlich Institute, Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines), who confirm that the claim is false. These official sources provide credibility to the verdict.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that there is no evidence to support the claim of a stolen radioactive vaccine. Both the BfArM and PEI representatives state that no vaccines were smuggled out, and no ampoules of any vaccine were taken. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Expert opinion": "The expert's verdict includes statements from vaccine experts who refute the claim. Scott Halperin, Director of the Canadian Center for Vaccinology, and Julie Bettinger, a vaccine safety scientist, confirm that no vaccines contain radium or are radioactive. Their expertise adds weight to the conclusion that the claim is false.", "Inconsistencies and misinformation": "The expert's verdict points out several inconsistencies and misinformation in the claim. It mentions that the claim does not specify the purpose or type of the allegedly stolen vaccine, and it circulates during a time when countries are focused on immunizing against Covid-19. This trend of inaccurate information and fear-mongering about vaccines raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim. Additionally, the expert's verdict highlights that the person behind the claim demonstrates a lack of knowledge about the responsible regulatory authorities, further discrediting the claim."}
