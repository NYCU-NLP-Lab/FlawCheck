{"The video evidence": "The expert analyzed the viral video that showed a group of men beating up another man with stones and sticks. The video was widely shared on social media platforms and WhatsApp.", "Eyewitness accounts": "The expert examined the claims made by users who shared the video along with warning messages. These users, such as Gopal Goswami and Narendra Singh, added captions implying that the incident depicted in the video was a case of Muslims lynching a Hindu man.", "Historical context": "The expert considered the fact that the video had been previously shared in 2019 with similar claims of a Hindu man being lynched by members of the Muslim community. This historical context raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Source credibility": "The expert highlighted the track record of Pushpendra Kulshrestha, a user who had shared the video with communal claims.
