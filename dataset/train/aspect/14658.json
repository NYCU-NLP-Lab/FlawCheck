{"The claim is based on a statement made by Congressman Steve LaTourette": "who has experience and expertise in infrastructure spending as a former member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.", "The claim is supported by the U": "S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration, which provided the figure of 42,000 jobs created for each $1 billion in infrastructure investment.", "The claim is outdated": "as the figure of 42,000 jobs was based on a 1996 study. The Department of Transportation acknowledges that the number changes over time and has since provided an updated figure of 27,800 jobs for $1 billion in highway spending in 2007.", "The 42": "000 jobs include different types of employment, including on-site highway construction jobs, indirect jobs in industries supporting highway construction, and induced jobs supported by the general economy."}
