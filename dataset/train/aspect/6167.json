{"The Pennsylvania Constitution does not explicitly forbid mail": "in voting and allows for specific instances of absentee voting, such as for illness.", "The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 77 in October 2019": "which permitted no-excuse, mail-in voting.", "The claim made by Sen": "Josh Hawley that Pennsylvania officials passed a law allowing universal mail-in balloting \"irregardless\" of the state constitution is misleading. The law permitting mail-in voting passed with strong Republican support and did not violate the constitution.", "Hawley": "s argument about interpretations limiting mail-in voting likely refers to historical limits on absentee voting for soldiers and a 1924 state supreme court decision stating that a ballot cannot be sent by mail or express. However, the state constitution allows the state legislature to set laws governing absentee voting in specific instances."}
