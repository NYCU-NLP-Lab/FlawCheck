{"The claim misrepresents what James Comey": "the director of the FBI, actually said. The expert's verdict clarifies that Comey did not say that the FBI \"cannot properly vet\" people coming from the Middle East. This aspect highlights the distortion of the claim and corrects the misinformation.", "The expert": "s verdict acknowledges that the vetting process is not perfect and that there is a concern about potential gaps in intelligence databases. Comey himself mentioned that the procedure relies on checking for criminal records or other suspicious activities. This aspect acknowledges the limitations of the vetting process while still affirming its overall effectiveness and contradicting the claim's assertion that the FBI cannot properly vet individuals from the Middle East."}
