{"The expert verified the claim by examining news accounts of the U": "S. House and Senate voting in January to raise the federal government's debt limit to $14.3 trillion, as pointed out by Perry's campaign.", "The expert also referred to a February 1": "2010 article on President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 federal budget, which stated that the budget would result in deficits of $5.08 trillion over five years, supporting Perry's claim.", "Additionally": "the expert considered Obama's proposed budget, which showed the nation's public debt increasing from $7.5 trillion in 2009 to $13.1 trillion in 2014, potentially increasing by $5.6 trillion. This further supported Perry's claim.", "The expert also took into account the input of Josh Gordon from The Concord Coalition": "who cautioned that much of the current and expected deficits were due to economic troubles rather than White House or congressional actions. However, Gordon acknowledged that running a deficit during an economic downturn is typical for the government."}
