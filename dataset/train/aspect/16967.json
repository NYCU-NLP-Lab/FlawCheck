{"The claim was based on an article published by the Christian conservative website Freedom Project": "which reported that a public school district in California was teaching pedophilia as a sexual orientation. This source was identified and evaluated as part of the verification process.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentioned the existence of the Healthy Youth Act, a California law that requires school districts to implement comprehensive sex education, including instruction on sexual orientation. This provides a legal framework and context for the inclusion of discussions about sexual orientation, which may have contributed to the teaching of pedophilia as a historical perspective rather than a promotion of it."}
