{"Lack of definitive studies": "The expert mentions that there are no definitive studies that prove or disprove the idea that granting licenses to undocumented immigrants leads to a decrease in insurance premiums for everyone. This indicates that there is a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim.", "Logical reasoning": "The expert acknowledges that there is a logical basis for the claim. Allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain licenses and requiring them to have insurance could potentially reduce the percentage of uninsured motorists, which might lead to a decrease in uninsured motorist premiums.", "Difficulty in pinpointing causation": "The expert explains that while rates may drop in states that grant licenses to undocumented immigrants, it would be challenging to attribute this solely to the license policy. There are numerous factors that contribute to adjusting insurance rates, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact impact of granting licenses to undocumented immigrants.", "Reference to a related study": "The expert mentions a 2015 study published in the Southern Economic Journal, which estimated the costs of denying licenses to undocumented immigrants. Although the study did not directly examine the effect on insurance rates, it provides some insight into the potential financial implications of denying licenses to this population."}
