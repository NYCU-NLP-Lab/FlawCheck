{"Sen": "Claire McCaskill's claim: In her statement, McCaskill claimed that she had \"no call from, or meeting with, the Russian ambassador. Ever.\" This claim was made in response to the revelations about Attorney General Jeff Sessions' meetings with the Russian ambassador.", "False claim exposed": "The expert's verdict reveals that McCaskill's claim turned out to be false. It was found that she did meet with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, four years ago on the issue of international adoptions along with other senators.", "Sessions": "justification: The expert's verdict includes the response from the Justice Department, which is headed by Sessions. Sessions' spokesperson stated that the meetings with Kislyak were not related to the Trump campaign but rather as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The spokesperson emphasized that Sessions was asked about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign, not about his meetings as a senator."}
