{"Statistical evidence": "The expert analyzes statistical data on reported cases of rape in Sweden over a specific period of time to determine if there has been a rise in sexual crime. The data shows that reported cases have remained steady for almost a decade, contradicting the claim.", "Examination of specific incidents": "The expert examines specific incidents of rape, such as the livestreamed gang rape in Uppsala, to understand the context and circumstances surrounding these cases. This helps in evaluating the severity and frequency of such incidents and their impact on the overall claim.", "Analysis of the claim": "s context: The expert considers the context in which the claim was made, specifically referring to Nigel Farage's statement about Malm\u00f6 being the \"rape capital\" of Europe. By examining the demographic composition and crime rates in Malm\u00f6, the expert can assess the accuracy of the claim and its relevance to the overall discussion.", "Evaluation of official reports": "The expert refers to the reports and findings of Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention (Br\u00e5) to verify the claim. The expert highlights that while there has been an increase in the broad category of \"sexual crimes\" since 2012, reported cases of rape did not spike suddenly after the influx of refugees in 2015. The expert also notes that changes in the definition of rape in 2005 and 2013 contribute to the apparent upward trend in reported cases."}
