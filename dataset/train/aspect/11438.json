{"Lack of evidence": "The expert points out that the article from Gateway Pundit, which made the claim, did not provide any evidence to support the assertion that Robby Mook deleted his tweets. The article only included a catchy title and a screenshot of Mook's Twitter page without pointing to any specific deleted tweets.", "Rumors and deleted tweets": "The expert mentions that even though the Gateway Pundit article was deleted shortly after publication, rumors continued to circulate about Mook deleting his Twitter feed. They highlight that even WikiLeaks tweeted about it but later deleted the tweet, indicating a lack of substantiated information.", "Lack of activity on Mook": "s account: The expert mentions that Mook joined Twitter in April 2015 but did not post anything until October 2016. They explain that this lack of activity is not indicative of a cover-up or deletion of tweets related to an FBI investigation. It suggests that Mook simply doesn't use the service frequently.", "Timing and ongoing investigation": "The expert notes that the FBI's announcement in October 2016 about reviewing additional emails related to Clinton's private server was not a surprising development for the Clinton campaign. They highlight that the investigation into Clinton's emails had been ongoing since 2014, before Mook even created his Twitter account. The expert questions the rationale behind claiming Mook would be \"spooked\" by a continuation of a long-running investigation and suggests that the Gateway Pundit failed to provide a plausible explanation for Mook possibly deleting tweets."}
