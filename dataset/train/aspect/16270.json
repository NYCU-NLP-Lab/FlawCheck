{"The claim is supported by a report from the President": "s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, which states that about half of business income accrues to pass-through entities such as S corporations and partnerships, and this income is subject to tax at the individual level.", "The claim is backed up by a report from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress": "which states that the tax hikes would affect approximately 940,000 small business owners.", "The claim is based on the fact that 53 percent of all business income is taxed through the individual code": "indicating that many small businesses file their taxes as individuals rather than corporations.", "The claim is challenged by fact": "checking organizations such as PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, which have deemed it false and an incorrect talking point."}
