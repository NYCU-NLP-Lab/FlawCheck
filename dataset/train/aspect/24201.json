{"The announcement of Twitter permanently suspending U": "S. President Donald Trump's account on Jan. 8, 2021, which led to claims of Twitter banning references to Orwell and the hashtag #1984.", "The fact that Sean Davis": "co-founder of The Federalist, made the claim on Twitter that the social media network was banning references to Orwell and not allowing the use of the hashtag #1984.", "The evidence that Twitter is not deleting or banning references to Orwell": "as Sean Davis' tweet referencing Orwell is still available on Twitter.", "The explanation provided by Twitter itself that the inability to use": "1984 as a hashtag is not related to censorship, politics, Trump, or the Capitol riot, but rather due to Twitter's policy of not allowing hashtags solely made up of numbers. Twitter suggests using alternative hashtags like #1984Orwell or #Orwell1984 for those wanting to create Orwell-related hashtags."}
