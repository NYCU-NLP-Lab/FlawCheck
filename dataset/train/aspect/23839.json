{"U": "S. Rep. Tom Price's claim: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia made a specific claim about President Barack Obama's proposed budget including two new tax increases that would collect about $14 billion. This claim serves as the basis for the investigation into its authenticity.", "Explanation of the proposed changes": "The expert's verdict includes an explanation provided by Price's spokesman, Ryan Murphy, which outlines the two changes in the proposed budget that Price was referring to. These changes involve requiring some beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts to take their inherited distributions over a five-year stretch and limiting the accrual of tax-favored retirement plans.", "White House report supporting the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that Murphy forwarded a White House report to support Price's claim. This report includes the proposed changes mentioned by Murphy and provides a table that calculates the revenue impact of these changes over a ten-year period. The total revenue impact amounts to slightly more than $14 billion, as Murphy stated.", "Expert opinions on the impact of the changes": "The expert's verdict includes the opinions of tax experts, such as Grover Norquist and Eric Toder, who discuss the potential impact of the proposed changes. Norquist highlights these changes as part of the top 10 tax increases in Obama's budget, while Toder agrees that the changes would affect a small number of Americans and may result in individuals paying more taxes or entering higher tax brackets. These expert opinions contribute to the verification process by providing additional perspectives on the claim."}
