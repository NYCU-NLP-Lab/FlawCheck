{"Lack of credible news coverage": "The expert highlights that a world record achievement would typically receive significant traditional news coverage. However, the claim about Ava Roberts being the youngest female African-American doctor has mainly been spread through fringe health sites, which raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Absence of verifiable sources": "The expert notes that the claim originated from a photograph of a woman named Ava Roberts, accompanied by text celebrating her achievement. However, the websites that published this claim did not provide any external sources or links to support the information. This lack of verifiable sources casts doubt on the claim's credibility.", "Ambiguity and lack of specific details": "The original claim about Ava Roberts being the youngest female African-American doctor was ambiguous and did not specify whether it referred to a world record or a specific jurisdiction. Additionally, there was a lack of specific details about Ava Roberts' life, such as her birthplace, medical school attended, area of specialization, or current practice. The absence of these details raises questions about the legitimacy of the claim.", "Inconsistent identification": "The expert's investigation found only one doctor named Ava Roberts currently practicing in the United States, who is an orthopedic surgeon in Colorado.
