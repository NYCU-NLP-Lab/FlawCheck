{"Supporting evidence from the press release and data": "The expert's verdict mentions that the tweet from Gov. Jim Justice linked to a press release that provided detailed information about the revenues and expenses from the general revenue fund.

This confirms the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison to previous years": "The expert's verdict mentions that the previous highest surplus occurred in 2011, which was $159.9 million more than estimated.
