{"The accused school shooter": "s name and background: The expert verified the identity of the shooter as Nikolas Cruz, a former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, based on the information provided by authorities.", "Adoption status": "The expert confirmed that Cruz was adopted as a small child, along with his younger brother, by a couple with the surname Cruz. This information contradicts the claim that he is undocumented or a DACA recipient.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert mentioned that the claim of Cruz being a Dreamer, DACA recipient, or undocumented was unfounded and spread through social media based on assumptions made solely due to his Spanish-sounding surname. There was no concrete evidence supporting this claim.", "Motivation for spreading the claim": "The expert highlighted that, after mass shootings, people often look for clues to fit their own political agendas or ideologies. In this case, the claim about Cruz's immigration status was seen as a distraction from addressing the tragedy itself and was unrelated to the actual events of the shooting."}
