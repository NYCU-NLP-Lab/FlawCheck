{"Congressional Budget Office analysis": "The expert referred to the analysis conducted by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to verify the authenticity of the claim. The CBO is a nonpartisan organization that provides projected costs of legislation, and their analysis showed that a six-year CHIP reauthorization would result in a cumulative savings of nearly $1 billion.", "Comparison of reauthorization periods": "The expert compared the savings generated by a six-year reauthorization and a 10-year reauthorization. The claim stated that a 10-year reauthorization would save $6 billion, and the expert confirmed that a CBO analysis projected a decrease in the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period for a 10-year reauthorization.", "Cost": "effectiveness of CHIP: The expert explained that CHIP saves the government money because the alternatives to providing coverage through CHIP, such as Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the marketplaces, and employer-sponsored insurance, cost more. This aspect highlights the underlying reasons for the cost savings associated with CHIP.", "Comparison of costs and revenue": "The expert mentioned the revenue and cost figures provided by the CBO analysis for both the six-year and 10-year reauthorizations. The analysis showed that the additional revenue generated by a six-year reauthorization exceeded the additional costs, resulting in a savings of nearly $1 billion. Similarly, the 10-year reauthorization was projected to decrease the deficit by $6 billion."}
