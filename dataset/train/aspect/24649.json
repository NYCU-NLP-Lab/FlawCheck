{"The number of times Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes": "The expert's verdict mentions that Bill Nelson voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times, which is a higher number than previously claimed by U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV.", "Inclusion of older votes": "The Mack campaign went back decades to cite votes that Nelson took while in the Florida House of Representatives (1973-78) and in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-90) to support their claim of Nelson voting for higher taxes.", "Examination of significant votes": "The expert's verdict states that they specifically examined the votes that the Mack campaign identified as the most significant while Nelson was in the U.S. House. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was verified by analyzing specific voting records.", "Consideration of budget resolutions": "The expert's verdict mentions that about half of the votes on the earlier 150-vote list were Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. The authenticity of the claim was evaluated by analyzing whether these resolutions should count as Nelson's votes for higher taxes."}
