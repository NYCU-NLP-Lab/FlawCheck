{"The video predates the coronavirus pandemic": "The expert found that the video in question was uploaded on YouTube in August 2019, which is several months before the first reported case of coronavirus in China. This suggests that the video is not related to the current pandemic.", "Reverse image search": "The expert conducted a reverse image search on one of the frames from the video and found that it was uploaded by a YouTuber during the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. This indicates that the video is not depicting dead bodies of coronavirus victims but rather a different event.", "Similar videos of Mecca": "The expert found other videos of Mecca where similar trucks can be seen, suggesting that the presence of such trucks is not unique to the context of the coronavirus pandemic. This further undermines the claim that the video shows mass dead bodies of coronavirus victims.", "Lack of independent verification": "The expert notes that Alt News could not independently verify the video. While they were able to provide evidence suggesting that the video is not related to the coronavirus pandemic, they did not have access to conclusive evidence to definitively prove or disprove the claim."}
