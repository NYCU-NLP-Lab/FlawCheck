{"Comparison of the photo in question with other images of the famous tortoise known as Alagba": "The expert compared the photo circulating on social media with other images of the tortoise and found discrepancies in size and appearance, suggesting that it may not be the same tortoise.", "Verification of the origin of the photo": "Through a reverse image search, the expert discovered that the photo of the giant tortoise was originally published on the Australian Daily Telegraph news website in 2014, in an article about the birth of two Galapagos tortoises at a zoo in Australia. This raises doubts about its connection to the claimed oldest tortoise in Africa.", "Examination of the source of the claim": "The expert found multiple posts on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, sharing the same photo and claiming it to be Africa's oldest tortoise. These posts were shared thousands of times, but the expert determined that they lacked reliable evidence or sources to support the claim.", "Consultation of animal experts": "The expert mentioned that animal experts doubted the possibility of a tortoise reaching such an advanced age as claimed. This suggests that professional opinion was sought to assess the authenticity of the claim."}
