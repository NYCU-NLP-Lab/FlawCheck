{"The claim is based on statistics and data": "The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Dave Brat's statement is based on testimony by Neal McCluskey, the director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute. McCluskey provided figures showing the increase in federal education funding over a specific period.", "The time period of the claim": "The expert's verdict highlights that there is an inaccuracy in Brat's statement regarding the time period over which the 375 percent increase in federal education funding occurred. McCluskey's testimony states that the increase happened over a 40-year period from 1970 to 2010, while Brat's statement mentions a 30-year period without specifying the exact dates.", "The impact of inflation": "The expert's verdict mentions that McCluskey adjusted the figures for inflation when calculating the 375 percent increase in federal education funding. This aspect emphasizes the importance of considering inflation when analyzing financial data over a long period.", "The influence of external factors": "The expert's verdict points out that the claim does not take into account the impact of the stimulus program and the additional funds provided to states after the Great Recession. This aspect suggests that the claim may not fully consider the complete picture of federal education spending and its correlation with test scores."}
