{"Feehan": "s employment status: The expert's verdict clarifies that Dan Feehan is not a full-time employee of the think tank mentioned in the claim. Instead, he is an adjunct senior fellow who contributes to research and gets paid on a per-project basis.", "Funding sources of the think tank": "The expert's verdict states that it would be fairer to say that a major defense contractor and the United States government are bigger current funders of the think tank than George Soros. This challenges the claim's assertion that Feehan is employed by a \"Soros-funded liberal outfit.\"", "Compensation from the think tank": "The expert's verdict provides specific details about Feehan's income from the think tank. As of August 13, his financial disclosure listed $55,412 in income from \"research/writing\" for the center this year and $7,916 from last year. This suggests that his compensation is based on his research contributions rather than direct funding from Soros.", "Super PAC support": "The expert's verdict questions the claim's statement that Feehan's campaign is \"propped up\" by super PACs backed by Soros' millions. It does not provide any evidence or information supporting this assertion, indicating that it is inaccurate."}
