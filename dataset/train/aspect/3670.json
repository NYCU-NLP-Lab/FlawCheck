{"The presence of botched executions": "The expert mentions that 7% of all executions by lethal injection are \"botched,\" which suggests that the death penalty may not be implemented consistently and in line with protocol. This aspect raises concerns about the authenticity of the claim that the death penalty is a deterrent.", "Lack of conclusive evidence": "The expert highlights that there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that the death penalty deters crime. The absence of widely accepted scientific evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "National Academy of Sciences report": "The expert refers to a report published by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty. The report concludes that the research conducted so far does not provide informative data on whether the death penalty decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates. This aspect questions the authenticity of the claim.", "Limitations in deterrence studies": "The expert points out two limitations in deterrence studies. First, researchers often struggle to access the necessary data from the government, making it difficult to compare the deterrent effects of the death penalty with other serious punishments. Second, there is a lack of information on the perceptions of potential murderers regarding the death penalty. These limitations cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim that the death penalty is a deterrent."}
