{"Lack of contextual information": "The expert notes that the original Facebook posts sharing the photograph did not provide any details about its subject, date, or other contextual information, making it difficult to verify its authenticity.", "Image dating back to 2012": "The expert mentions that the image can be traced back to at least 2012 through a blog post, Imgur page, and Reddit thread. These sources suggest that the photograph was taken in or before December 2012 and identified the man with the sign as a protester, not a Salvation Army volunteer.", "Shift in descriptions": "The expert points out that later in 2012, descriptions of the photograph changed, asserting that the sign's holder was not a protester but a bell ringer. This shift in narratives adds complexity to verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Lack of response from the Salvation Army": "Despite attempting to contact the organization for further information about the photograph, the expert states that they did not receive a reply. This absence of input from the Salvation Army hinders the verification process."}
