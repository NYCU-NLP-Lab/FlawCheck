{"The images circulating on social media claiming that Home Minister Amit Shah has contracted coronavirus were analyzed": "Both images were found to be stills from TV channels, with one image showing Shah surrounded by men dressed in white and in military uniform, and the other image showing a screen with text in Hindi stating that Shah tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to the hospital.", "The first viral image had the logo of Aaj Tak": "a well-known news channel, while the second viral image had a logo of Sach News, a channel that could not be found on the list of paid and free TV channels grouped by the Telecom Regulatory Authority. Additionally, the background screen in the second image had ABP News written on it, indicating that the logo used in the viral image did not match with the actual logo of Sach News.", "The viral images were found to have been created using a meme generator called": "Break Your Own News,\" as indicated by the watermark on the images. This raised suspicions about the authenticity of the images, as they could have been maliciously morphed by adding the Aaj Tak logo and blurring the watermark that was not hidden by the logo.", "Further investigation revealed that the person standing next to Shah in the viral image was identified as BJP member Ashish Shelar": "This clue led to a keyword search on Google, which resulted in finding a 2014 Indian Express report stating that Amit Shah had visited NCP chief Sharad Pawar at Breach Candy Hospital after Pawar underwent surgery. This information contradicted the claim that Shah had contracted coronavirus."}
