{"The claim states that residents in Woonsocket are paying high prices for electricity fueled by foreign oil": "The expert's investigation found that power plants in Rhode Island primarily burn natural gas, with only a small percentage generated from oil. This suggests that the claim's assertion of high electricity prices due to foreign oil may be inaccurate.", "The expert contacted ISO New England": "an organization overseeing electricity distribution, to verify the claim. ISO provided data showing the energy sources for power generation in New England, which included natural gas, nuclear, coal, hydropower, and renewable sources. This data contradicts the claim's focus on foreign oil as a primary energy source.", "The expert discovered that the state": "s Resource Recovery Corporation already generates electricity from garbage by collecting methane gas from the landfill and burning it to produce power. This undermines the claim's argument for the need of a waste-to-energy plant in Woonsocket.", "The expert questioned the logic behind the claim": "s suggestion to use garbage as an alternative energy resource, as the state already has a landfill gas collection system in place. This raises doubts about the necessity of a waste-to-energy plant and its potential impact on energy costs or dependence on foreign oil."}
