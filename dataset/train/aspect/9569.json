{"Multiple sources reported on the funeral of Ahmed Patel": "The expert's verdict mentions that The Hindu, a reputable news outlet, reported on the funeral of Ahmed Patel, stating that he was laid to rest on November 26 in his native village Piraman near Bharuch, Gujarat. This provides a reliable source to verify the claim.", "Comparison with other videos and images": "The expert's verdict mentions that Gujarat-based news outlets Khabar Ce and Loktej used a screenshot from the viral video as the featured image of their reports. Additionally, a YouTube channel Hindustani Reporter included an identical funeral procession seen in the viral video, but it was actually the funeral procession of MNS leader Jameel Shaik. Comparing these videos and images helps in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Live stream of the funeral procession": "Alt News found a live stream of the funeral procession by Gujarat Tak on YouTube, which showed top INC officials present and following COVID-19 protocols, except for social distancing. This provides further evidence of the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison of the dead body in the viral video": "At the 2:01:33 mark of the live stream, the expert's verdict mentions that the stretcher carrying Patel's fully covered dead body can be seen. Unlike in the viral video, the dead body in the live stream is covered with a black colored shroud. This comparison helps in verifying the accuracy of the claim."}
