{"The claim originated from a right": "wing Slovenian website, Nova24TV, which published a story about immigrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina using MasterCard debit cards. The accusation was sourced to an anonymous \"local police officer.\"", "The original story did not mention George Soros": "but conspiracy-pushing websites falsely cited Nova24TV's piece to tie the claim to Soros. However, this was a misrepresentation as the claim conflated an existing UNHCR program with a separate humanitarian partnership involving Soros and MasterCard.", "The UNHCR program mentioned in the claim was launched in Moldova in 2011 and expanded in 2016": "It provided aid to millions of people across 94 countries, allowing recipients to access their money through cash machines or \"mobile money\" electronic payments distributed through specialized cell phones.", "The claim falsely stated that Soros": "the UN, EU, and MasterCard were funding the distribution of prepaid debit cards to refugees. While there is a partnership between Soros and MasterCard for a separate humanitarian initiative, it is not directly related to the UNHCR program mentioned in the claim."}
