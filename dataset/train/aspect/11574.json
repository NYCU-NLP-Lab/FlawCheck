{"Comparison of budget figures": "The expert compared the claimed healthcare budget of N46 billion to the actual budget figures presented by President Muhammadu Buhari, which were N380.21 billion in the 2021 budget proposal and initially N441 billion in the current budget.", "Population data": "The expert considered the population of Nigeria, which was estimated at 206.3 million as of 1 July 2020 by the United Nations. This population figure was used to evaluate the claim that the healthcare budget of N46 billion was allocated for 200 million people.", "Budget allocation history": "The expert analyzed the budgetary allocations to healthcare from 2017 to 2019, which were consistently at least N300 billion. This historical data provided additional context to assess the claim's authenticity.", "Expert opinion": "The expert consulted Professor Kayode Osungbade, a health policy and management expert, who stated that healthcare is underfunded in Nigeria, with its share of the budget usually less than 5%. This expert opinion supported the finding that the claimed healthcare budget of N46 billion was unlikely to be accurate."}
