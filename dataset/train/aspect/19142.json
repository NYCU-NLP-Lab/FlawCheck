{"The claim is based on a statistic from a 2003 paper published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics": "a division of the U.S. Justice Department. The paper states that \"about 1 in 3 black males...are expected to go to prison during their lifetime if current incarceration rates remain unchanged.\"", "The statistic is outdated": "as it is based on data from 2001, making it 14 years old at the time of the expert's analysis.", "The claim has been repeated and cited repeatedly over the years": "even though there is no updated research to support or refute the current percentage of black males ending up in jail.", "The expert reached the conclusion that while the statistic may not be far off": "it is hard to determine the accuracy without updated data and research."}
