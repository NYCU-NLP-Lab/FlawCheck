{"Two successive voter ID laws in Texas imposed new requirements on voters who might have changed their last names due to marriage or divorce": "primarily affecting women.", "The laws do not have anything to do with birth certificates and do not require the bringing of marriage or divorce documents to the polls": "Voters can cast normal ballots after signing affidavits and marking boxes labeled \"Similar Name.\"", "The meme referenced a real voter ID controversy in Texas but presented false details and exaggerated the extent to which the policy impeded voters": "including women, from casting their ballots.", "The accepted forms of ID under the voter ID law were specified as driver": "s license, election identification certificate, Texas Department of Public Safety personal ID card, military ID, U.S. citizenship certificate, U.S. passport, and a concealed handgun license. Voters with names on their ID that were \"substantially similar\" to the name on the voter rolls could cast a ballot after signing an affidavit."}
