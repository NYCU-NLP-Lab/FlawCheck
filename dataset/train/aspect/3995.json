{"The expert identified that the viral photograph purporting to show Donald and Ivanka Trump with Jeffrey Epstein was not a genuine photograph": "but a composite of at least two different pictures. This suggests that the claim is not supported by authentic evidence.", "The expert provided evidence of a genuine photograph taken in 1993 at the Harley Davidson Cafe in Manhattan": "showing Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jeffrey Epstein, and two of Trump's children, Eric and Ivanka. This photograph confirms that Trump and Epstein had some level of association, supporting the claim of their connection.", "The expert mentioned that Trump himself acknowledged his friendly relationship with Epstein in a 2002 interview": "where he stated that Epstein was \"a lot of fun to be with\" and that they both have an affinity for beautiful women, some of whom are young. This statement by Trump further strengthens the claim of their association.", "The expert also referenced another photograph taken in 2000 at Trump": "s Mar-A-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, showing Trump, Melania Trump, Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell. This additional photograph provides further evidence of Trump's association with Epstein and supports the claim that they had a relationship."}
