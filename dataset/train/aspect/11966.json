{"Trump": "s claim of winning 52% of women voters: The expert's verdict highlights that Trump's claim of winning 52% of women voters is misleading because it only refers to a subset of women, specifically white women. The expert points out that Trump did not specify this during his speeches or interviews.", "Exit poll data": "The expert mentions that according to exit poll data conducted by Edison Research, Trump received only 41% of the overall women's vote in 2016, while 54% of women voted for Hillary Clinton. This data contradicts Trump's claim of winning a majority of women voters.", "Partisanship as a predictor of vote choice": "The expert explains that one's political party identification is a stronger predictor of vote choice than gender. Political science researchers suggest that white women consistently vote Republican, which could explain Trump's support among this demographic.", "Criticism from political experts": "The expert quotes Jennifer Lawless, a professor of politics, who states that the exit polls make it clear that Trump did not win women. This highlights the consensus among political experts that Trump's claim is not supported by the data."}
