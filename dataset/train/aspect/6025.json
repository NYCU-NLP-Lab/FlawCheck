{"Opposition from Republicans": "The claim is verified by the fact that Republican politicians, such as Sen. Jim DeMint and U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, have used the word \"amnesty\" to criticize President Obama's immigration plan.", "Definition of amnesty": "The expert refers to the legal definitions of amnesty, such as the one provided by Black's Law Dictionary, which defines it as a sovereign act of pardon and oblivion for past acts, granted by a government to all persons who have been guilty of crime. The expert suggests that amnesty is more accurate when it leads to permanent legal status.", "Comparison to previous fact": "checks: The expert mentions previous fact-checks conducted by PolitiFact, where the word \"amnesty\" was used in reference to President Obama's support for the DREAM Act, a bill that offers the possibility of citizenship. This suggests that the term has been used in similar contexts before.", "President Obama": "s statement: The expert includes President Obama's own statement about the immigration plan, where he explicitly denies that it is amnesty. Obama describes it as a temporary, stopgap measure that does not provide a path to citizenship or permanent fix, but rather offers relief and hope to young undocumented individuals. This statement serves as evidence against the claim that the plan is amnesty."}
