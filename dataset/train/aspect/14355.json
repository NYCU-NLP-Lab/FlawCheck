{"The claim was verified by checking the original message shared by Joy Gaines": "Friedler on Facebook, where she claimed to have a statement from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer advising voters not to mail their ballots.", "The expert also examined the clarification provided by Gaines": "Friedler, where she explained that Whitmer did not explicitly tell voters not to mail their ballots but instead encouraged them to drop off their ballots in person.", "The expert considered the previous statements made by Governor Whitmer and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson": "who both encouraged voters to deliver their absentee ballots in person or use designated drop boxes due to concerns about mail delays and ensuring timely delivery.", "The expert also took into account the investigation conducted by USA TODAY": "which found that mail delivery times in Michigan have been significantly delayed during the pandemic, further supporting the need for alternative methods of ballot submission."}
