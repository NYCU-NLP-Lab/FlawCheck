{"Trump": "s incorrect phrasing: The expert notes that Trump did not accurately phrase his claim about the gross domestic product (GDP) being \"below zero.\" The expert clarifies that GDP is measured in trillions of dollars and not close to zero. Trump actually meant to refer to GDP growth, which is different from the overall GDP value.", "Inaccurate claim": "The expert confirms that Trump's claim about GDP growth being \"never below zero\" is incorrect. The expert points out that negative GDP growth, or GDP shrinkage, has occurred in the past and is a characteristic of recessions. The expert cites historical data showing that there have been 42 quarters since 1947 with negative GDP growth on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis.", "Revisions and caution": "The expert mentions that the initial negative GDP growth in the first quarter of 2015 may not remain negative once final revisions are made. The government releases revised data that takes into account new and complete information. Additionally, the expert advises caution in interpreting quarterly GDP figures, as they can be influenced by factors like seasonal adjustments and unusual patterns.", "Economic analysis": "The expert includes insights from economists and analysts to provide a broader perspective. An economist from George Washington University states that the first quarter estimates of weak growth do not necessarily indicate a recession. Some analysts attribute these weak estimates to factors like harsh winters that were not adequately adjusted for. The expert emphasizes the general rule that two consecutive quarters of negative growth are typically considered a signal of a recession."}
