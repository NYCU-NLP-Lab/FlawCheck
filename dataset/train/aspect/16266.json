{"The claim that Syrian refugees are not being vetted is false": "as seven North Carolina cities and towns have received several hundred Syrian refugees since 2014, and the U.S. recently took in its 10,000th refugee from Syria.", "The claim that there is no system to vet refugees is also false": "as there has been a vetting system in place since 1980 and it has been adjusted multiple times since 9/11.", "While it can be challenging to gather comprehensive information about every Syrian refugee due to the violence and destruction in the region": "there is still a vetting process in place that includes background checks and other measures.", "The claim that the FBI is not being informed about the whereabouts of Syrian refugees is not accurate": "as refugees who pass the United Nations checks and are referred to the U.S. undergo further scrutiny from the FBI and other federal agencies, including in-person interviews and medical screenings."}
