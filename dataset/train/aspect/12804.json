{"The claim is supported by the analysis conducted by the New York Times": "which compared hate crimes per capita in 2005 and 2014 using data from the FBI and the U.S. Census. The analysis found that \"L.G.B.T. people are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans, and the rate of hate crimes against them has surpassed that of crimes against Jews.\"", "Another expert": "Mark Potok from the Southern Poverty Law Center, conducted a similar analysis of 14 years of hate crime data in 2011. He found that LGBT individuals were victimized at 8.3 times the expected rate, making them far more likely than other minority groups to be victimized by violent hate crimes.", "The FBI": "s definition of hate crimes as \"criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender\u2019s bias against\" a particular group, including sexual orientation, supports the claim that the LGBT community is often the target of hate crimes.", "The statement made by the spokesperson for Lynch": "the person being referred to as the expert, confirms that she was referring to the analysis conducted by the New York Times and the data from the FBI and the U.S. Census. This further verifies the authenticity of the claim."}
