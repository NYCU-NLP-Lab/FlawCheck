{"Multiple conservative news sites": "including 100% Fed Up and Gateway Pundit, published articles claiming that the CDC illegally changed mortality count rules and inflated the Covid-19 death toll.", "These articles cited a 25": "page paper issued by the \"An Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge\" (IPAK) as evidence for the claim. The paper alleges that the existing Covid-19 fatality data may be compromised in terms of accuracy and integrity, and illegal under existing federal laws.", "The paper suggests that if the CDC had followed the 2003 guidelines": "the total death toll from Covid-19 would be approximately 16.7 times lower than what is currently being reported, resulting in an increase of 1,567 percent.", "Bob Anderson": "chief of mortality statistics at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), refuted the claim, stating that the new guidance is essentially the same as the old guidelines, with the only difference being a specific focus on Covid-19. Anderson explained that the authors of the report incorrectly assumed that under the 2003 guidelines, only death certificates listing Covid-19 without any comorbidities would be counted."}
