{"The claim is supported by the statement of Nicholas Burns": "a Harvard University professor and former undersecretary of state for political affairs, who stated that European allies pay the US $2.5 billion a year to keep their forces in Europe.", "The claim is further backed by National Security Action": "an advocacy group founded by Democratic foreign policy specialists, which tweeted an infographic stating that allies cover 34% of the US basing costs, amounting to $2.5 billion annually.", "The claim is also supported by a study conducted by the RAND Corp": "in 2013, which found that NATO allies' combined support for US military activities on their soil was over $2.48 billion in 2002 dollars, essentially equivalent to $2.5 billion.", "However": "it is acknowledged by experts that the figure from 2002 may not apply to 2018, as US troop levels in Europe have decreased from 100,000 in 2002 to 65,000 today. Nonetheless, it is still considered the best estimate available."}
