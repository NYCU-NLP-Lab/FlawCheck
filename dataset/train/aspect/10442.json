{"The claim is based on a report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers": "which concluded that the stimulus raised employment by 1.5 million to 2 million jobs through the fourth quarter of 2009.", "The Congressional Budget Office": "CBO), a nonpartisan government agency, estimated that the number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009 was between 800,000 and 2.4 million. This wide range reflects the uncertainty of such estimates and encompasses most economists' views on the effects of fiscal stimulus.", "Other economic forecasters": "such as IHS/Global Impact and Macroeconomic Advisers, also projected varying numbers of jobs saved or created by the stimulus, with estimates ranging from 1 million to 1.25 million.", "The CEA report acknowledges that measuring the impact of policy actions on growth and employment is inherently difficult and subject to substantial margins of error": "However, the report states that the results are strong enough and clear enough to provide solid conclusions, and the consensus among various private and government analysts adds reassurance to the analysis."}
