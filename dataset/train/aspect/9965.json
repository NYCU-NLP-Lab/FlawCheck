The expert's verdict confirms that this number is incorrect and larger than the total number of Somali refugees resettled in the entire United States during Obama's presidency.", "The expert": "s verdict provides accurate data from the State Department's Refugee Processing Center, which states that from January 20, 2009, to January 19, 2017, a total of 54,514 Somali refugees arrived in the U.S. Of those, only 6,320 went to Minnesota.", "The Minnesota Department of Health reports that between 1979 and 2017": "a total of 23,915 refugees arrived in Minnesota from Somalia. This number includes both primary and secondary arrivals.", "The exact size of the Somali population in Minnesota is challenging to determine": "but the U.S. Census Bureau provides estimates. The 2013-2017 American Community Survey five-year estimate shows 52,333 people in Minnesota with full or partial Somali ancestry.
