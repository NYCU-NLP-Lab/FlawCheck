{"Lack of evidence": "The expert states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Hillary Clinton \"started\" the birther movement against Barack Obama in 2008. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Clinton": "s supporters pushing the theory: The expert acknowledges that some of Clinton's loyal supporters did promote the birther theory during the 2008 presidential campaign. However, this does not directly implicate Clinton herself or her campaign in starting the movement.", "Trump": "s repeated false claim: The expert mentions that Donald Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that Clinton started the birther movement. This repetition of the claim without providing any evidence further questions its authenticity.", "Politico": "s investigation: The expert refers to a Politico article from 2011 that investigated the origins of birtherism. The article concluded that the movement began with Democrats, not Republicans, and found no links between the Clinton campaign and the rumors in 2008. This investigation adds credibility to the lack of authenticity of the claim."}
