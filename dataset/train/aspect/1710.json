{"The misleading tweet": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim originated from a misleading tweet posted by the 2020 reelection campaign for President Donald Trump. This tweet falsely alleged that House Majority Whip James Clyburn called for President Trump to be hanged.", "Video evidence": "The expert's analysis emphasizes that anyone who watched the video embedded in the tweet would understand that Clyburn did not literally call for Trump's hanging. The video shows Clyburn using a figure of speech to describe a trial with a pre-ordained outcome.", "CNN transcript": "The expert refers to a CNN transcript of an exchange between Clyburn and CNN host John Berman. The transcript confirms that Clyburn was discussing the delay in sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate and expressing the need for a fair and impartial trial. He used the phrase \"hang him\" in a rhetorical manner, meaning to give him a fair trial.", "Contextual reference": "The expert's verdict also includes a reference to comments made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who openly stated his lack of impartiality regarding the impeachment hearings. Clyburn's quote can be better understood in the context of McConnell's comments, where he suggests that if McConnell is not committed to a fair trial, then they should give him a fair trial and \"hang him\" (meaning to expose his lack of fairness)."}
