The expert pointed out that Radtke's calculation did not consider the correct time period, as it started three months after Allen began his term and ended three months before he stopped counting.", "Time period": "The expert determined the correct time period for analyzing the national debt increase during George Allen's term in the U.S. Senate. They stated that the period ran from October 1, 2001, to September 30, 2007.", "National debt increase": "The expert used data from the U.S. Department of Treasury to determine the national debt at the beginning and end of George Allen's term. They found that the national debt increased by $3.202 trillion during that period.", "Voting record": "The expert examined the voting record of George Allen during his time in the Senate and found that he supported each of about four dozen appropriation bills that came to the Senate floor. This suggests that Allen did approve the budgets that contributed to the national debt increase mentioned in the claim."}
