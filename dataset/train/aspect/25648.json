{"Comparison of current and proposed standards": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Houston school district analysis compared the number of historical figures required to be taught under the current standards (64) with the number proposed in the revised standards (252). This comparison was employed to verify the claim that the State Board of Education more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about.", "Discrepancy in numbers": "The expert's verdict highlights that there was a discrepancy between the numbers reported in the Houston Chronicle blog and the Houston school district analysis. While the blog reported 262 historical figures in the proposed standards, the analysis found 252. This aspect was considered to ensure accuracy and to address any potential inconsistencies in the claim.", "Concerns expressed by curriculum managers": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Houston school district's social studies curriculum managers, Angela Miller and Michael Dorsey, expressed concerns about the proposed changes to the standards during a district school board meeting. Their concerns about the increase in the \"number of people who are now required topics of instruction\" were taken into account to validate the claim.", "Source credibility": "The expert's verdict refers to the Texas Freedom Network, a watchdog group that monitors \"far-right issues, organizations, money, and leaders,\" as the source of the claim. The inclusion of this information suggests that the credibility and reputation of the source were considered in verifying the authenticity of the claim."}
