{"The claim is based on an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states": "which asked them to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts. This letter serves as evidence of the State Department's request for email submission.", "Hillary Clinton is the only former secretary of state who has turned over emails and documents in response to the State Department": "s request. This fact verifies the claim that she is \"the only one who's done it.\"", "Two of the four former secretaries of state": "Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice, did not provide personal emails because they either did not use email much during their time at the State Department or did not regularly use email for official communication. This information further supports the claim that Clinton is the only one who complied with the request.", "The authenticity of the claim is also supported by the New York Times and the State Department": "which reported that Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from her personal email account. This corroborates the fact that she responded to the State Department's request."}
