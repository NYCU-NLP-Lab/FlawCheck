{"The expert": "s verdict refutes the claims on social media that Floyd's death was staged and that he has appeared in public since the incident. This contradicts the claim and provides evidence against its authenticity.", "The post in question includes two pictures": "one showing someone wearing a black hat, glasses, face mask, and hoodie with the words \"RIP George Floyd.\" The other is a selfie with the text \"Video 3 days ago.\" The expert's verdict explains that the first picture is of former NBA player Stephen Jackson at a rally in support of George Floyd. This verifies that the person in the picture is not George Floyd, undermining the claim's authenticity.", "The second picture": "which does show George Floyd, was not taken \"three days ago\" as claimed in the post. It was published by news outlets the day after Floyd's death, according to Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Floyd's family. This discrepancy further discredits the claim's authenticity."}
