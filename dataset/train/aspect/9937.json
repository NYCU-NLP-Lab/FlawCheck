{"Lack of verification from radio stations": "The expert noted that two radio stations shared the photograph on their Facebook pages, claiming it was of a high school student on her way to prom. However, when contacted by the online publication Mic, the stations did not provide any evidence or confirmation that the person in the photo was indeed a high school student.", "Absence of essential elements in the photograph": "The image did not include common features found in prom pictures, such as a date in a tuxedo, fellow attendees, a corsage, a limousine, or a planned background. This led some commenters to question whether the woman in the photo was actually attending a prom or if it was more of a paparazzi-style photograph.", "Reverse image search results": "Before the \"prom\" angle gained traction, a reverse image search described the image as a \"fashion model\" rather than a prom dress. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim that the photograph depicted a high school student's prom dress.", "Unclear origin and lack of substantiating information": "The earliest appearance of the photograph on Tumblr was dated 9 April 2016, but no additional information was provided to support the claim that the dress was for a prom. Despite social media users condemning the woman and her parents based on captions, there was no solid proof or circumstantial evidence suggesting that the photograph was of a high school student in a revealing prom dress."}
