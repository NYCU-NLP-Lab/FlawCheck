{"The source of the claim": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim was made based on a photograph circulating on Twitter, which was shared by a Facebook page known for spreading misinformation. This raises doubts about the credibility of the source and the claim itself.", "Verification of the photograph": "The expert's verdict states that the photograph used in the claim was actually taken in 2016 during the JNU students' union elections, and it shows students celebrating the victory of certain student bodies. This contradicts the claim that the photograph depicts JNU students celebrating the death of CRPF jawans in 2010.", "Timing and involvement of Kanhaiya Kumar": "The expert's verdict highlights that Kanhaiya Kumar, who is mentioned in the claim, was not even a student at JNU during the time of the Dantewada massacre in 2010. This further discredits the claim and questions the accuracy of the information being circulated.", "Lack of permission for the event": "The expert's verdict mentions that the event organized by the 'Forum Against War on People' in JNU, which the claim associates with the celebration of the Dantewada attack, did not seek prior permission from the university authorities. However, the group claims that the event was unrelated to the killings in Dantewada. This aspect adds to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the claim."}
