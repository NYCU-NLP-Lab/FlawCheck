{"Biden": "s statement was based on a report from the Economic Policy Institute titled \"The State of Working America,\" which compared top CEO pay to the earnings of a typical worker. This report found that in 2007, a CEO earned more in one workday than the typical worker earned all year.", "The report considered compensation for": "top U.S. executives,\" including salary, stock options, bonuses, and other forms of compensation. This broader definition of CEO pay contributed to the significant difference between CEO earnings and the average worker's earnings.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics data was referenced to determine the current annual earnings of production workers": "which was around $31,900. Adding $10,000 per day for 260 working days in a year, the calculation resulted in nearly $11 million, which exceeded the earnings of CEOs at the country's biggest corporations.", "However": "it is important to note that Biden's statement did not specify workdays and referred to \"average CEOs,\" while the Economic Policy Institute report focused on \"top\" CEOs from the largest U.S. firms. Average CEOs, as indicated by a Mercer CEO compensation study, earned significantly less than those at the top, with CEOs at small companies earning around $4.7 million per year."}
