{"The claim made by Governor Greg Abbott that property crime is rising in Austin is based on a tweet he posted": "citing a KVUE article that mentioned an advisory from the Austin Police Department warning residents about securing their homes before going on a trip. The article also stated that there had been 2,983 burglaries in the first eight months of the year, representing an 11% increase compared to the same period last year.", "However": "the claim fails to consider that burglary is just one form of property crime and does not reflect the overall trend. In fact, property crime in Austin has generally been decreasing, with a slight drop recorded so far this year. The claim's attempt to link the rise in crime to the city council's decision to cut police funding is unfounded.", "The Austin Police Department": "s Chief's Monthly Report, available on their website, provides a comprehensive overview of the crimes officers respond to each month. The 2,983 burglaries mentioned in the KVUE article only account for 9% of all property crimes recorded through August. Other crimes falling into this category include shoplifting, credit card fraud, embezzlement, and vandalism.", "Looking at the long": "term trend, property crime rates in Austin have generally been decreasing over the past decade, with exceptions in 2018 and 2019. In 2010, nearly 46,000 reports of property crime were recorded, equivalent to about 5.8 incidents per 100 residents. In 2019, this number dropped to 36,588 reports, or about 3.7 incidents per 100 residents. Burglaries specifically have also decreased from about 1.1 incidents per 100 residents in 2010 to about 0.4 in 2019."}
