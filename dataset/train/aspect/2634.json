{"The claim was shared in a Facebook post on February 21": "2021, which was subsequently deleted after being shared more than 3000 times.", "The Sinhala": "language text superimposed on the image of the post translates to English as: \"This will be very important to those expecting to get a tattoo. Not sure if you guys are aware of this, but did you know you can\u2019t donate blood if you are tattooed? Also, even if you manage to donate blood, your blood will be discarded at the point where it is being screened. A lot of young boys and girls are into tattooing these days, that is why this was mentioned. If you are planning to get a tattoo, don't donate blood.\"", "The same graphic with the claim has been shared in multiple Facebook posts": "4. The Director of Sri Lanka\u2019s National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS), Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe, clarified that the claim is misleading. People with tattoos are only temporarily discouraged from blood donation for one year as a precautionary measure against blood-borne infections. The one-year wait time is not a blanket ban, and all donated blood samples go through a screening process to detect any contaminants. The NBTS website also does not exclude people with tattoos in its Donor Selection Criteria."}
