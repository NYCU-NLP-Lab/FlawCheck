{"Larry Elder": "s claim: Larry Elder, a conservative talk show host, stated on CNN that \"74 percent of small-business people believe that Obamacare is a bad idea.\"", "Source of the claim": "Elder's executive producer provided a Washington Examiner article as the basis for the claim. The article's headline stated \"74 percent of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare.\" The article was based on a survey conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.", "Survey details": "The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive and had 1,304 respondents who held executive-level positions in companies with less than 500 employees and annual revenue less than $25 million. Approximately one-third of the respondents were U.S. Chamber of Commerce members. The survey was said to be weighted to represent the nation's small-business population.", "Concerns about the employer mandate": "The survey respondents expressed concerns about the health care law's employer mandate, which required businesses with 50 or more employees to provide insurance or face a fine. Respondents indicated that they would take various measures, such as cutting hours, reducing hiring, or replacing full-time employees with part-time workers, to avoid the mandate. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean they believe the entire health care law is a bad idea, as Elder claimed."}
