{"The claim states that Kim Schrier supports a state income tax": "which implies that she would make the sales tax rate worse. This aspect of the claim suggests that Schrier's support for a state income tax would lead to an increase in taxes for the residents.", "The expert": "s verdict highlights that the ad attacking Aftab Pureval in Ohio's 1st Congressional District is misleading. The ad falsely suggests that Pureval, while working at a D.C. lobbying firm, was involved in selling out Americans by helping Libya reduce payments owed to families of Americans killed by Libyan terrorism. This aspect of the claim questions the credibility and trustworthiness of Pureval based on his past employment.", "Another misleading attack ad mentioned in the expert": "s verdict targets Abigail Spanberger, who is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Dave Brat for Virginia's 7th Congressional District seat. The ad falsely portrays Spanberger as being in alignment with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and claims she would vote for a Medicare for All bill, despite Spanberger's denial of supporting such a bill. This aspect of the claim questions Spanberger's alignment with Pelosi and her stance on healthcare.", "The ad attacking Spanberger also mentions her opposition to the 2017 Republican tax law": "referring to it as a \"$2,000 middle-class tax cut.\" However, the expert's verdict points out that the average tax cut under the law was significantly lower, with the Tax Policy Center analysis indicating amounts ranging from $380 to $1,810 for different income quintiles. This aspect of the claim challenges the accuracy of the tax cut amount attributed to Spanberger's opposition."}
