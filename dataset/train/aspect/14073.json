{"Research by CQ Press": "The expert's verdict mentions that the authenticity of the claim was verified by research compiled by CQ Press. This research provided city-by-city crime information for cities of at least 75,000 residents that reported crime data to the FBI for its Uniform Crime Reporting Program as of September 2010.", "Crime rates comparison": "The expert's verdict states that the six largest cities in Ohio (Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron, and Dayton) had higher crime rates than six major cities along the U.S.-Mexico border (San Diego, El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen, and Yuma). The comparison was made for categories such as murder, rape, robbery, and burglary.", "Population verification": "The expert's verdict mentions that the population of each of the twelve cities (six Ohio cities and six border cities) was verified with the U.S. Census Bureau. The average population of the Ohio cities was nearly 363,000, while the average population of the border cities was a little more than 447,000.", "Specific crime category comparison": "The expert's verdict highlights that in two crime categories, there were unfavorable aspects for the border cities. While the Ohio cities had higher rates of murder, rape, robbery, and burglary overall, the border city of Yuma had nearly 50% more reported cases of auto theft per 100,000 residents compared to the Ohio cities. This indicates a specific aspect where the border cities had higher rates of crime."}
