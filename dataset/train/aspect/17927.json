{"The incorrect use of statistics": "The expert points out that House Speaker Will Weatherford cited the wrong numbers when referring to the percentage of \"single, childless adults\" who would benefit from expanding Medicaid. The actual estimate provided by the House was 82 percent, not 85 percent.", "Lack of estimation for the specific group": "The state did not provide an estimate for the percentage of \"single and childless\" adults who would be covered under Medicaid expansion. The expert states that the state only estimated the impact on childless adults, with a percentage of 62.", "Inability to measure childless and single individuals separately": "The expert explains that it is difficult to measure the percentage of childless adults who would receive Medicaid coverage under expansion because the state did not provide separate estimates for childless and single individuals.", "Lack of information from other experts": "The expert mentions that they were unable to find information from other experts regarding the percentage of childless adults who could receive Medicaid coverage under expansion. This suggests a lack of comprehensive data on this specific aspect of the claim."}
