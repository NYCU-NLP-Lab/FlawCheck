{"The claim was verified by citing a specific article from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was published in May 2009": "This article discussed the proposed budget submitted by then-Governor Jim Doyle, which included a cut in state aid for schools by $290 million.", "The expert also examined the voting record of Sandy Pasch": "specifically her vote on the spending plan that included the budget cuts. It was found that Pasch joined all but two Assembly Democrats in approving the spending plan, which ultimately resulted in a cut of general school aid by $294 million over two years.", "The expert considered the context of the claim by mentioning that Governor Doyle stated that total spending on public schools would actually rise by about 5 percent due to additional federal stimulus funds": "However, it was determined that the stimulus money did not fully offset the state aid reduction.", "The expert also mentioned that the claim made by the conservative Club for Growth Wisconsin was not limited to Sandy Pasch but also included similar ads targeting other Assembly Democrats in recall races": "This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was verified by examining multiple instances where the same claim was made."}
