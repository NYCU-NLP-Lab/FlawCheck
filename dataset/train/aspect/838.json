{"Lack of credible context": "The expert noted that there was a lack of genuine context provided by the accompanying captions and comments on the video. The details about where and when the video was filmed were contradictory, with different sources claiming different relationships between the individuals involved.", "Theatrical production elements": "The expert observed that the setting of the video, including the stage-like environment, the presence of a band, furniture, and a \"cutting award\" prop, suggested that it was more aligned with a theatrical production rather than a real-life incident.", "Analysis of the stabbing": "The expert examined the actual stabbing in the video and found that it appeared more consistent with a theatrical production. They noted that the slash markings on the man's shirt were visible prior to the commencement of the stabbing, indicating that it might have been staged.", "Expert opinion": "The expert sought the opinion of Steve Tolin, the founder of Tolin FX, a special FX Makeup studio. Tolin stated that in his opinion, the stabbing appeared fake and was likely created using a prop called a \"bleeding knife.\" This expert opinion further supported the claim that the video was not authentic."}
