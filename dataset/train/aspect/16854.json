{"U": "S. Rep. Michael McCaul's statement: The expert's verdict mentions that U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, made the claim that \"1 in 100 people are sociopaths\" in an interview with Karina Kling of the Capital Tonight program on Spectrum News in Austin. This statement serves as the initial source of the claim.", "Reference to diagnostic criteria": "The expert's verdict highlights that experts do not necessarily use the term \"sociopath\" and instead refer to \"antisocial personality disorder\" as per the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria. This aspect emphasizes the distinction between the terminology used by the expert and the claim made by McCaul.", "Prevalence range of antisocial personality disorder": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders states the prevalence of antisocial personality disorder, which is considered similar to sociopathy, ranges from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent. This aspect provides statistical information regarding the prevalence of the disorder, which indirectly relates to the claim.", "Description of psychopathy": "The expert's verdict refers to an article in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin titled \"Psychopathy\" that describes psychopathy as a personality disorder with various traits and behaviors, including a lack of remorse, empathy, and guilt, along with callous disregard for the rights of others. This aspect provides a broader understanding of psychopathy and its characteristics, which may align with the claim made by McCaul."}
