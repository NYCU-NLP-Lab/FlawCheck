{"Past occurrences of snowfall in the Sahara Desert": "The expert mentions that snow has fallen in the high-altitude region of the Sahara Desert in northern Algeria on at least four occasions in the past six years. This indicates that snowfall in the desert is not a rare event and has been documented before.", "Corroboration by local photographers and news reports": "The expert mentions that the photographs of snow in the Sahara Desert were captured by local photographers, Sekkouri Kamel and Hamouda Ben Jerad, and were subsequently shared on social media platforms like Facebook. These images have also been corroborated by Algerian news reports, adding credibility to the claim.", "Previous documentation of snowfall in the region": "The expert cites a previous instance of snowfall in the Bechar region near A\u00efn S\u00e9fra in January 2012, which was documented by Algerian TV channel Central TV. This further supports the authenticity of the claim and establishes that snowfall in the Sahara Desert is not an entirely unprecedented phenomenon.", "Media coverage and misconceptions": "The expert mentions that snowfall in the Sahara Desert often generates significant media coverage due to the counterintuitive nature of snow falling in a desert. However, the expert clarifies that deserts refer to lack of precipitation rather than average temperatures. The expert also highlights that previous occurrences of snow in the Sahara Desert have been falsely reported as the first snow in decades, despite regular snowfall events. This aspect emphasizes the need to verify claims and not rely solely on media coverage."}
