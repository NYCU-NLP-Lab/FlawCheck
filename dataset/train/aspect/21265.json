{"The expert": "s verdict is based on the statement made by Laura Tyson, who is a credible source as she has served as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton. This lends credibility to her claim about the unemployment rates for different educational groups.", "The expert cross": "referenced Tyson's claim with the data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is a reputable and reliable source for employment data in the United States. By consulting the BLS website, the expert was able to verify the unemployment rates for different educational attainment levels.", "The expert compared Tyson": "s claim with the overall national unemployment rate for all workers in July, which was 9.5 percent. This comparison helps to put Tyson's statement into context and assess its accuracy.", "While the BLS does not regularly publish the unemployment rate for those with more than a college education": "the expert consulted with other economists and labor and employment experts who confirmed that this statistic can be calculated. Although the specific rate was not provided in the expert's verdict, the fact that it can be calculated adds further support to Tyson's claim."}
