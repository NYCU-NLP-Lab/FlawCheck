{"The article by Megan Fox included screenshots of the dolls and a live video showcasing an authentic Amazon listing for one of the dolls": "providing visual evidence of their existence on the website.", "Amazon confirmed in a statement to Snopes that the dolls had been listed but were subsequently removed": "indicating that the company took action in response to the reports.", "The quick removal of the dolls from the website": "within three minutes of the article's publication, suggests that Amazon acted promptly upon becoming aware of the products, further supporting their authenticity.", "Although Amazon did not provide a precise explanation for the removal of the dolls or directly address whether the listings violated their rules": "the company's policies and guidelines prohibit the sale of certain items, including those that could potentially violate ethical or legal standards. This indirectly supports the claim that the dolls were indeed listed on Amazon."}
