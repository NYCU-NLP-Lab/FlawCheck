{"Perdue": "s claim is supported by the company's annual financial statements, which show an increase in the number of stores and employees during his tenure.", "Dollar General had ambitious plans to open 600 to 800 stores a year": "and during Perdue's tenure, the company exceeded those projections.", "The number of stores increased from 6": "192 to 8,260, and the number of full-time and part-time employees increased from 53,500 to 69,500, indicating growth during Perdue's four-year tenure.", "The campaign spokesman": "s argument that the annual reports do not entirely match Perdue's tenure is not sufficient to discredit the claim, as the reports still show a significant increase in stores and jobs during the relevant period."}
