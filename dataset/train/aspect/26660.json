However, this law does not apply to the president or the vice president, as they are exempt from its provisions.", "The Justice Department has stated that the conflict": "of-interest provision was never intended to apply to the president. Placing such laws on the president could potentially constrain him in an unconstitutional manner.", "Presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases": "which further highlights the exemption from normal ethics and conflict-of-interest laws that they enjoy."}
