{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the use of data from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census": "published by the Solar Foundation. This data confirms that there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016.", "The second aspect involves comparing the solar industry employment numbers with the coal mining industry employment numbers": "The Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, provided data that shows there were 65,971 people working at coal mines in 2016. This data supports the claim that there are more workers employed in the solar industry than in the coal mining industry.", "The third aspect involves understanding the methodology used to collect the data": "The Solar Foundation conducted over 500,000 telephone calls and 60,000 emails to energy establishments across the United States to gather information for their report. They included jobs in various categories such as installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development. This methodology adds credibility to the employment numbers reported by the Solar Foundation.", "The fourth aspect is the acknowledgment that the comparison between the solar and coal industries is not exactly apples": "to-apples. While the solar industry data includes jobs in various sectors related to solar energy, the coal mining industry data specifically focuses on workers engaged in production at coal mines. This distinction is important to consider when interpreting the employment numbers."}
