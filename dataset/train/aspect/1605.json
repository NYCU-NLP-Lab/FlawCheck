{"The claim is supported by a study conducted by the U": "S. Department of Transportation in September 2010. This study provides data on distracted driving and its contribution to fatal car crashes in 2009.", "The study indicates that distraction was reported for 11 percent of the drivers involved in fatal crashes in 2009": "This percentage is higher than what was initially claimed by Senator Zaffirini, who stated that 11 percent of fatal crashes were attributed to distracted driving.", "The study also reveals that distraction figured into a larger percentage of fatal crashes in 2009": "specifically 16 percent. This shows an increase from 10 percent in 2005, indicating a growing concern regarding distracted driving.", "The study relies on data collected from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration": "s Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System. These sources provide a comprehensive overview of fatal crashes and their causes, although the study acknowledges limitations due to reporting inconsistencies across jurisdictions."}
