{"The claim states that Milwaukee": "incarcerates 1.2% of white men\" and has \"incarcerated over 50% of black men in their 30s.\" The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is examining the source of the statistics, which is a study published by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2013.", "The expert": "s verdict also mentions that the UWM study found a high rate of African-American men in Wisconsin (12.8%) being incarcerated at the time, which was the highest rate in the nation. This information supports the claim's second part regarding the disproportionately high incarceration rate of black men, but it does not specify the exact percentage for Milwaukee alone.", "Another aspect considered is the timeframe of the claim": "The first part of the claim refers to a specific point in time, while the second part covers a period of more than two decades. This distinction is important in understanding the accuracy and relevance of the claim's second part regarding the incarceration of black men in their 30s in Milwaukee."}
