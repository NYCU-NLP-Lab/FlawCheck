{"Reverse image search": "The expert used a reverse image search to verify the authenticity of the meme. This search confirmed that the photo in the meme was of Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, a Nazi guard who died earlier in the year, and not of George Soros.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert noted that there is no evidence to support the claim that George Soros was ever a Nazi. Despite conspiracy theories, Soros' own biography and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's information on local Jewish Councils suggest that Soros worked as a courier for one of these councils, making decisions about complying or refusing German demands.", "Apologies and retractions": "The expert mentioned that both Roseanne Barr and the Toronto Star have issued apologies and retractions for false claims that George Soros was a Nazi collaborator. These retractions indicate that the initial claims were not based on accurate information.", "Soros": "personal history: The expert highlighted Soros' personal history as a Holocaust survivor. Soros was born in Hungary in 1930, lived through the Nazi occupation, and his Jewish family survived by securing false identity papers. This personal history contradicts the claim that Soros was a Nazi guard."}
