{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the historical evidence provided by the expert": "The expert explains that for the first several decades of its existence, the U.S. Congress did not pay salaries to its members and instead paid them on a per diem basis while Congress was in session. This historical information supports the claim that members of Congress were initially paid on a per diem basis.", "The second aspect used to verify the claim is the examination of the U": "S. Constitution. The expert references Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution, which states that \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This constitutional provision contradicts the claim that members of Congress were initially paid on a per diem basis to prevent them from raising their own salaries.", "Another aspect employed to verify the claim is the interpretation of the constitutional clause regarding the determination of pay": "The expert explains that the clause requiring pay to be \"ascertained by Law\" means that Congress must set its own pay. This interpretation suggests that members of Congress had the authority to determine their own compensation, rather than being limited to a per diem basis.", "The final aspect used to verify the claim is the understanding of the legislative process": "The expert clarifies that any change in salary for members of Congress must be done via a bill or joint resolution, which are presented to the President for a signature. This aspect highlights the fact that the President could veto a bill changing members' salaries if deemed inappropriate, further supporting the notion that members of Congress were not restricted to a per diem payment system to prevent salary increases."}
