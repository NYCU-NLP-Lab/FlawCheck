{"The claim originated from a right": "wing radio host, Hal Turner, who is a convicted felon and known for making unsupported claims.", "Turner stated that witnesses reported seeing a large contingent of Marines arriving at CIA Headquarters in tilt": "rotor aircraft and quickly moving into the building.", "Witnesses also claimed that a significant number of tilt": "rotor aircraft were seen circling the grounds of CIA Headquarters and parked on the grass around the building.", "The Marine Corps spokesperson": "Major Brian Block, denied the claim, stating that it is not unusual for Marines aircraft to fly to locations throughout the National Capitol Region, but a Marine expeditionary unit did not land at Langley and the claim is considered ridiculous."}
