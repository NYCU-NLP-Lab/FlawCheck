{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the comparison of the claimed photograph with known photographs from other events": "The expert found that the viral picture circulating on social media was actually taken in November 2014 in Nikomazi, South Africa, during a religious crusade by the In His Name Ministries. This comparison helped establish that the photograph was not genuine and did not show the crowd outside of Area 51 in September 2019.", "The second aspect utilized was the analysis of the details within the photograph": "The expert noticed red flags that suggested the second miscaptioned picture, which was also being spread as if it showed the crowd outside of Area 51 in September 2019, was fake. One such red flag was the presence of an \"Area 51\" sign on the fence, which is highly unlikely as the government facility is officially called Homey Airport (KXTA). Additionally, upon closer inspection, the people in the photograph appeared to be characters from a video game, indicating that it was not a genuine depiction of the event.", "The third aspect involved gathering information from credible sources": "Mick Akers, a journalist for the Las Vegas Review Journal, reported that approximately 100 people showed up at the back gate of Area 51 near Rachel to follow through on the original Storm Area 51 plan. This information provided an accurate estimate of the number of attendees and confirmed that some people did show up outside the government facility on Sept. 20, 2019.", "The fourth aspect focused on the overall context and background of the event": "The expert mentioned that the Storm Area 51 event started as a joke on a Facebook page and gained widespread attention. While there was no genuine effort to storm the gates, some individuals did attend the event, and it remained non-violent. Understanding the context and background helped provide a comprehensive understanding of the event and its authenticity."}
