The differences between these two approaches were noted, but they did not change the overall thrust of the claim.", "The expert also mentioned that the rise in Sub": "Saharan Africa was technically 33 percent, which is slightly lower than the \"more than one-third\" stated in the claim.", "In addition to per capita GDP growth": "the World Bank also considers per capita Gross National Income as another yardstick to gauge economic well-being. The trends observed in both measures were found to be consistent."}
