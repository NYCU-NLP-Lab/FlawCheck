{"Lack of historical evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is no evidence to support the claim that Twa pygmies from Central Africa were the original inhabitants of Ireland. The absence of historical records or archaeological findings indicating the presence of Twa pygmies on the island casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Influence of pseudohistory": "The theory linking St. Patrick to the genocide of Twa pygmies seems to be influenced by euhemerism, a form of pseudohistory popular in the 19th century. This suggests that the claim may be based on unfounded or discredited historical interpretations.", "Inconsistencies with known history": "The expert mentions that St. Patrick lived in the 5th century AD and was originally from Roman-occupied Britain. The claim that he led the genocide of Twa pygmies in Ireland contradicts the generally accepted historical narrative of St. Patrick's life and mission as a Christian cleric.", "Origins in Afrocentrism": "The expert notes that the \"Twa\" theory of Irish prehistory appears to be informed by Afrocentrism, an approach to historical study that emphasizes the role of African people in the evolution of Western civilization. While Afrocentrism has its merits, the claim linking Twa pygmies to Ireland may be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of historical connections between Africa and Europe."}
