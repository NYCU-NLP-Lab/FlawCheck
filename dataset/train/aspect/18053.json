{"The statement made by the lieutenant governor": "Kim Guadagno, claiming that Chris Christie \"has not increased taxes on anyone\" was verified by multiple fact-checking groups, including PolitiFact New Jersey and FactCheck.org. This indicates that the claim has been thoroughly examined and assessed by experts in the field.", "It was found that while Christie did not raise the state": "s three biggest revenue-generating taxes (gross income, sales, and corporation business taxes), he took actions that resulted in tax increases for certain New Jersey residents. Specifically, cuts to tax relief programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and property tax relief programs had the effect of reducing the amount of support available to individuals, essentially increasing their tax burden.", "The EITC": "which provides tax credits to low-income individuals, was cut during Christie's first year in office. This action impacted a significant number of New Jerseyans who relied on the credit for tax relief, even though they owed no taxes to the state. The reduction of this credit can be seen as a form of tax increase for those affected.", "Christie also implemented cuts to spending for property tax relief programs": "such as the Homestead Benefit program, which significantly reduced the average rebate received by eligible residents. This reduction in tax relief can also be seen as an indirect tax increase for those who relied on these programs to alleviate their tax burden."}
