{"Lack of tangible evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim made by Undercover Colors lacked evidence of a functional prototype. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was not verified through any tangible proof of the product's effectiveness.", "Criticisms of feasibility": "The expert's verdict mentions that some critics argued that the concept of a drug-detecting fingernail polish, like Undercover Colors, was not feasible. This suggests that the authenticity of the claim was questioned based on the doubts raised about the practicality of the product.", "Unreliable existing testing kits": "The expert's verdict refers to studies that found commercially available \"date-rape\" drug testing kits to be unreliable. These kits were found to produce false positives or negatives, indicating that their effectiveness in detecting drugs linked to date rape was questionable. This aspect was employed to verify the claim by highlighting the limitations of existing testing methods.", "Most common substances in date rapes": "The expert's verdict states that alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and MDMA were found to be the most common substances used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults, while GHB and Rohypnol were relatively rare. This aspect was likely employed to question the relevance and effectiveness of a nail polish specifically designed to detect GHB, Rohypnol, Xanax, and Special K, as claimed by Undercover Colors."}
