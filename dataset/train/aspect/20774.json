{"Glitches and non": "compliance instances: The expert mentions that declassified documents from 2009 enumerate instances of \"non-compliance\" in the metadata program. These instances include cases where phone numbers were listed as approved without proper channels and automatic addition of phone numbers to an alert list without meeting the standard. However, these instances were mostly corrected immediately, and there was no significant intentional misuse of the system.", "Lack of documented cases of abuse": "The claim states that there is not a single documented case of abuse of the bulk metadata collection program. The expert acknowledges that there were glitches and non-compliance instances but argues that they do not demonstrate willful negligence or intentional misuse of the system.", "Oversight and regulations": "The expert discusses the actions of NSA officials who oversaw the program. While there were instances of non-compliance, the majority of them involved mishandling technology rather than intentional abuse. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) also noted in its 2014 appraisal that there was no significant intentional misuse of the system.", "Definition of": "abuse\": The expert mentions that the verdict on whether the metadata program has produced a single case of abuse depends on how \"abuse\" is defined. This aspect suggests that the authenticity of the claim might be subjective and open to interpretation based on different definitions of abuse."}
