{"The historical context": "The expert examined the maternal mortality rates in the years leading up to the Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973. They found that the rates were already declining rapidly before the ruling, indicating that factors other than the legalization of abortion were contributing to the decrease.", "Comparison of mortality rates": "The expert compared the maternal mortality rates before and after the Roe vs. Wade decision. They found that while there was a slightly bigger drop in rates between 1972 and 1973, the overall decline in rates continued in the years after as well. This suggests that the decrease in maternal mortality cannot be solely attributed to the legalization of abortion.", "Analysis of abortion": "related deaths: The expert also examined the mortality rates specifically related to abortion. They found that the rates were already decreasing before Roe vs. Wade due to advancements in medical technology and healthcare practices. However, the decline in abortion-related deaths accelerated when abortion became legal.", "Expert opinion": "The expert cited the opinion of David Grimes, a clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology, who stated that while overall maternal mortality and abortion mortality were declining before Roe vs. Wade, the decline in abortion-related deaths was more pronounced after the legalization of abortion. This expert opinion adds credibility to the claim but also highlights the complex factors influencing maternal mortality rates."}
