{"Outdated voter registration statistics": "The expert found that the table used in the claim relied on outdated voter registration data from 2018, which did not reflect the current numbers. This discrepancy raised doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Misleading title and updated information": "The title of the table, which claimed to show \"Number Of Registered Voters by State 2020,\" was found to be misleading as it was based on 2018 data. However, the page was later updated on November 4 to include the 2020 statistics and link to official state sources. This inconsistency added to the suspicion surrounding the claim.", "Verification of registration numbers": "The expert independently verified the registration numbers mentioned in the misleading table for each state. They found that the numbers provided in the claim were significantly lower than the actual registered voter counts reported by official sources. This contradiction cast further doubt on the claim's authenticity.", "Same": "day voter registration: The expert highlighted that some of the claims made in the posts, such as the voter turnout percentages exceeding 100%, did not take into account the allowance of same-day voter registration in certain states. This factor could potentially lead to higher registration numbers than those mentioned in the claim, further undermining its credibility."}
