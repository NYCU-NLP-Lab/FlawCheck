{"Lack of official endorsement": "The expert's verdict highlights that the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the larger umbrella group representing boilermakers, has not endorsed any U.S. Presidential candidate for the 2020 Election. This indicates that Biden's claim of endorsement from the boilermakers union may not be authentic.", "Contradictory statements": "The expert's verdict includes statements from John Hughes, the business manager of Local 154, a Pittsburgh-area chapter of the boilermakers union. Hughes denies that the boilermakers endorsed Biden and questions who Biden actually spoke to within the union. This contradiction raises doubts about the authenticity of Biden's claim.", "Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that when asked for evidence of Biden's conversation with the boilermakers union, the Biden campaign's director of rapid response provided none. This absence of evidence further undermines the authenticity of Biden's claim.", "Alternative endorsements": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Biden campaign listed several other Pennsylvania unions that Biden met with and won endorsements from while campaigning. This suggests that Biden may have sought to compensate for the lack of an official boilermakers union endorsement by highlighting endorsements from other unions. This aspect raises questions about the specificity and credibility of Biden's claim."}
