{"The expert analyzed the official data for the nation": "s gross domestic product (GDP) compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis to verify the claim.", "The expert compared the claim to the percentage change in inflation": "adjusted GDP over the four most recent calendar years for which full-year data was available (2008-2012). This allowed them to calculate an average growth rate of 1.1 percentage points per year, indicating that the claim was slightly understating the actual growth.", "The expert also considered more current quarterly data": "specifically measuring from the third quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2013. This analysis showed that the average inflation-adjusted GDP growth rate over the last four years was 2.3 percent per year, significantly higher than what the claim suggested.", "Finally": "the expert reached out to Cruz's office to inquire about the methodology used for the claim. Cruz's spokesperson explained that they used annual data, which they considered the most accurate way to compare growth year to year. The spokesperson also dismissed the quarterly data as a small snapshot in time that doesn't provide an accurate picture when compared to annual data from a previous year."}
