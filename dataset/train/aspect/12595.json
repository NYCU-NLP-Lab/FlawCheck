{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that there was a complete absence of evidence to support the claim made about Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Despite the claim being widely spread on social media platforms, no news reports, financial records, witness statements, or any other form of evidence were provided to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Unverified information": "The claim was initially posted on Facebook without any evidence to back it up. Despite the lack of verification, many viewers accepted the information as fact and continued to spread it on social media platforms. This aspect emphasizes the importance of verifying information before accepting or sharing it.", "Inconsistency with credible reporting": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim lacked any credible reporting to support its validity. Despite being a popular target for false rumors, no reputable news outlets or sources had reported on the alleged \"sheriff evictions,\" closed bank accounts, or low credit score of Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.", "Unlikely source of information": "The person who initially posted the claim on Facebook, Donn Johnson, was identified as a security officer living in Florida. The expert's verdict points out that it would be highly unlikely for Johnson to have access to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's credit score or information regarding her alleged evictions. This aspect raises doubts about the credibility and reliability of the source of the claim."}
