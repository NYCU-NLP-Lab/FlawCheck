{"Antifa is not a designated terrorist organization": "The expert's verdict clearly states that Antifa, which stands for \"anti-fascist,\" is a broad coalition of left-wing activists that has not been designated as a terrorist organization. This contradicts the claim that Trump labeled Antifa as a terrorist organization.", "Due process rights for suspected terrorists": "The expert mentions that Americans suspected of terrorism are afforded due process rights granted by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. This implies that even if Antifa were labeled as a terrorist organization, individuals associated with it would still have due process rights.", "Lack of evidence linking antifa to significant role in protests": "The expert highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that antifa played any significant role in the violent protests following George Floyd's death. This challenges the notion that Antifa's rights were stripped by the Patriot Act due to their terrorist designation.", "Inaccuracy of the claim": "The expert's verdict clearly states that the claim is inaccurate. It emphasizes that Antifa is not a designated terrorist organization, and even if it were, American activists would still have due process rights. This directly contradicts the claim made in the post."}
