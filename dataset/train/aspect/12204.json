{"The expert referred to the Missing Person database published by the Iowa Department of Public Safety": "which showed that 34 children were reported missing in Iowa over a two-week period in July 2018. This official database provided concrete data to verify the claim.", "The expert compared the number of missing children reported in Iowa in July 2018 with historical norms and found that it was not unusual": "They stated that the bulk of such cases are quickly resolved, indicating that the claim of an alarming increase in \"vanishing\" children was not supported by the evidence.", "The expert highlighted the source of the claim": "which was an article written by Rachel Blevins for the conspiracy-prone Free Thought Project website. They pointed out that Blevins used a snapshot of the Iowa Missing Person database at a given point in time to create the impression of an unusual number of missing persons, but this approach lacked context and did not reflect an alarming trend.", "The expert cited a statement released by the Iowa Department of Public Safety": "which provided further context and contradicted the claim. The statement clarified that, in recent weeks, nothing unique, unusual, or alarming had occurred in terms of missing juveniles in Iowa. It emphasized that the number of missing juveniles reported in fiscal year 2017 was an average of approximately 12 juveniles a day, with the majority being found or returning home within 24 hours. This information debunked the claim of an alarming increase in missing children."}
