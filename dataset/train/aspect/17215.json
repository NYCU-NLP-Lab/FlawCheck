{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that President Trump's claim of $100 billion invested in opportunity zones lacks evidence. Trump, his administration, and his campaign have not provided any evidence to support this claim.", "Discrepancy with other estimates": "The expert mentions that the $100 billion figure stated by Trump is far higher than other estimates. The Novogradac firm reported that the total investment in opportunity zones had surpassed $10 billion, and the Urban Institute cited investment of \"at least $10 billion.\" These estimates are significantly lower than Trump's claim.", "Expert opinion": "The expert includes the opinion of John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, who laughed when asked about Trump's $100 billion figure. Lettieri estimates that the total investment in opportunity zones is in the $25 billion to $30 billion range, which is much lower than Trump's claim.", "Treasury Department": "s projection: The expert suggests that Trump's projection of $100 billion may have originated from the Treasury Department. Secretary Steve Mnuchin used this figure in the fall of 2018 when announcing proposed regulations for the program and in an interview with The Hill newspaper. However, it is important to note that this projection does not reflect actual investment."}
