{"Historical disagreement": "Historians and researchers have differing opinions on whether Queen Charlotte was mixed race, and there is no conclusive decision about her ancestry. This indicates that the authenticity of the claim is still a subject of debate and uncertainty.", "Researcher": "s argument: The claim originated from researcher and historian Mario de Valdes y Cocom, who argued in the '90s that Queen Charlotte's features in certain portraits were \"conspicuously Negroid.\" This suggests that the claim is based on the analysis and interpretation of specific historical evidence.", "Ancestral connection": "The claim asserts that Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, a black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. This highlights the alleged ancestral link between Queen Charlotte and African ancestry, which is used to support the claim.", "Contemporary accounts": "The claim is supported by quotes from Queen Charlotte's contemporaries, including her personal physician Baron Stockmar, who described her as having a \"true mulatto face.\" These contemporary accounts provide additional evidence that is cited to verify the claim."}
