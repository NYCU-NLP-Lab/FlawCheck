{"Testimony of eyewitnesses": "The expert's verdict mentions that a team under the command of Qassem Soleimani stormed into the meeting in Karbala, Iraq, killing Americans and capturing Brian Freeman and his team. The expert's statement implies that there were eyewitnesses present at the scene who could testify to the involvement of Soleimani.", "U": "S. Department of Defense evidence: The expert's verdict states that the U.S. Department of Defense has sufficient evidence and intelligence to conclude that the attack in Karbala, Iraq, in January 2007, which killed five U.S. service members including Freeman, was directed, planned, and funded by the Quds Force. This evidence would have been collected and analyzed by the Department of Defense to verify the claim.", "Official position of the U": "S. government: The expert's verdict mentions that the key claim made in the Facebook posts, attributing responsibility for Freeman's death to Soleimani, reflects the official position and conclusion of the U.S. government. This suggests that the claim has been verified and supported by the government's investigation and assessment of the incident.", "Denial by Iranian government and Soleimani": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that both the Iranian government and Soleimani himself have denied any involvement of the Quds Force in attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq at the time of Freeman's death. While their denial does not disprove the claim, it presents an opposing viewpoint that needs to be considered in the overall assessment of the claim's authenticity."}
