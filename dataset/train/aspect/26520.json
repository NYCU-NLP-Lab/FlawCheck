{"Lack of official announcement": "The expert's verdict states that there have been no official announcements made by the White House, CDC, WHO, or any other official governing body regarding a national lockdown or mandatory quarantine in the U.S. This lack of official confirmation casts doubt on the authenticity of the claim.", "Chain message origin": "The claim is identified as a chain message that circulated on social media platforms. These messages are often known for spreading unfounded claims and rumors. The expert's verdict highlights that the claim did not reflect an official message from any credible source, further questioning its authenticity.", "Contradictory information": "The expert's verdict mentions that the National Security Council addressed the messages on Twitter, stating that messages about a \"national quarantine\" were fake. This contradiction between the claim and the official statement adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim's authenticity.", "Timing and context": "The claim gained traction in mid-March 2020 when there was a heightened state of concern due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This timing coincided with the cancellation of events, closure of schools and businesses, and the declaration of a national emergency by President Donald Trump. However, the expert's verdict clarifies that while there were some elements of truth related to the national emergency declaration, the claim itself lacked credibility."}
