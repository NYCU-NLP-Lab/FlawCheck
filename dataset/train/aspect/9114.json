{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that they reached out to both U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel and the Crist campaign for evidence of the claim that Rick Scott closed 30 women's health care centers, but neither could provide any evidence to support the statement.", "Admission of error": "The Crist campaign admitted that the statement was an error and clarified that it should have read \"He cut funding to 30 rape crisis centers across the state\" instead of \"closed 30 women's health care centers.\"", "Confirmation of inaccuracy": "The expert's verdict states that the statement that Scott closed 30 women's health centers is completely wrong, indicating that there is no evidence or factual basis to support the claim.", "Examination of funding for rape crisis centers": "The expert's verdict also delves into the funding for rape crisis centers under Scott's administration, providing information on the amount of state dollars allocated to these centers and highlighting Scott's veto of $1.5 million approved by the Legislature. This aspect helps to contextualize the claim and provides additional information related to women's healthcare funding in Florida."}
