{"The claim originated from an old video featuring Roger Stone": "a Republican political operative, who alleged that Cory Booker stole $600,000 from a city water authority and laundered it through his law firm.", "The source of Stone": "s claim can be traced back to a corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Booker contributed to the bribery scheme.", "A state controller report conducted in 2014": "a year after Booker left his position as mayor, found \"an egregious and yet preventable abuse of public funds\" at the watershed. The report highlighted the lack of meaningful oversight and mismanagement within the agency.", "Booker was named in a lawsuit filed by the watershed": "s board of trustees, along with other individuals, for their alleged roles in the waste of taxpayer money. Booker's attorneys argued that the lawsuit mischaracterized his role and that he had not attended any meetings as an ex-officio chairman of the board."}
