{"The expert mentions that the NRA leadership in Washington": "including Wayne LaPierre, supported expanded background checks in 1999. This is evidenced by LaPierre's testimony before a House subcommittee where he expressed support for mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show.", "However": "the House rejected the expansion of background checks in June 1999, and the NRA supported this rejection. The Washington Post headline at the time stated, \"NRA Achieves Its Goal: Nothing.\" This indicates that the NRA did not actively pursue the implementation of expanded background checks.", "The expert also mentions that the recent legislation proposed by Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Pat Toomey addressed some of the NRA": "s concerns with the 1999 provisions. The legislation excluded transfers between close relatives, increased the number of guns at gun shows exempt from background checks, and reduced the time allowed for background checks to 24 hours. However, the NRA still opposed applying background checks to transfers between distant relatives and \"lifelong friends,\" similar to their opposition in 1999.", "The expert highlights the NRA": "s advertisement targeting West Virginia voters, urging them to tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment and to call the NRA to support criminal background checks. This suggests that the NRA's stance on expanded background checks may have evolved over time, with the organization now facing pressure to support such measures."}
