{"The expert": "Alan Holyoak, identified the shark in the photograph as a salmon shark, not a baby great white shark. He based this conclusion on his knowledge and experience as a marine biologist.", "Holyoak wrote about his finding on his blog and shared additional photos of the animal": "providing visual evidence to support his claim that it was a salmon shark.", "Holyoak compared the characteristics of the shark in the photograph to those of known species": "specifically white sharks, porbeagle sharks, and salmon sharks. He noted that the coloration and teeth of the shark in the photo did not match those of a white shark, leading him to believe it was a salmon shark.", "Holyoak provided size comparisons between salmon sharks and great white sharks": "highlighting that adult salmon sharks reach a maximum length of around 10 feet, while great whites can grow up to 20 feet or more. This size difference further supported his conclusion that the shark in the photo was not a baby great white shark."}
