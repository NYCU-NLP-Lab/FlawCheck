{"Comparison of budget cuts": "The expert compared the budget cuts made by DeKalb County to those of other similarly sized governments in the Atlanta metro region, including Cobb, Fulton, and Gwinnett counties, as well as the city of Atlanta. This comparison was done to determine if DeKalb County had indeed cut more money from its general fund budget than any other local government in the region.", "Analysis of population size": "The expert took into account the population size of DeKalb County, which was 747,274 according to the most recent U.S. census data. The expert considered it unfair to compare the budgets of smaller cities or counties within the Atlanta metro region to DeKalb County, given the significant difference in population. Therefore, the analysis focused on comparing DeKalb County to similarly sized governments with populations exceeding 500,000.", "Examination of budget years": "The expert considered the budget years of DeKalb County, Fulton County, Gwinnett County, Cobb County, and the city of Atlanta. DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett counties based their budgets on a calendar-year basis, while Atlanta's budget year began on July 1 and ended on June 30, and Cobb County's budget year began on October 1 and ended on September 30. The expert compared the last four budgets adopted by each government to evaluate the trend in budget changes.", "Calculation of budget decrease": "The expert analyzed the actual budget figures provided by county officials to calculate the decrease in DeKalb County's general fund budget. The claim stated a cut of $109 million, but the expert's analysis revealed that the actual decrease was $107 million. This aspect focused on verifying the accuracy of the claimed budget cut amount."}
