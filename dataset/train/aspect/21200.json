{"The claim is based on a statement made by Senator Saslaw": "who referenced an article from Rolling Stone that states \"one in five women is sexually assaulted in college though only about 12 percent report it to police.\" This article did not provide a specific source for the statistic.", "The Rolling Stone article likely obtained the statistic from a study conducted by the U": "S. Justice Department's National Institute of Justice in December 2007. This study surveyed 5,446 undergraduate women at two unnamed large public universities.", "Vice President Joe Biden also referenced the statistic during a speech": "stating that one in five college women are sexually assaulted during their college years. His office confirmed that the statement was based on the findings of the Justice Department's study.", "The Justice Department": "s study defined sexual assault as unwanted touching, intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, or sexual penetration with an object or finger. The study found that 19.8 percent of women surveyed during their senior year had experienced a sexual assault since entering college. However, the study's results were limited to the two unidentified colleges surveyed and may not be representative of all college women. The survey also had a relatively low response rate of 42 percent."}
