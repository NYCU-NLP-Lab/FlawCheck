{"Progress Texas cited a leaked report from the U": "S. Treasury inspector general, which stated that out of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny by the IRS, 96 groups had names related to conservative ideologies such as \"tea party,\" \"patriot,\" or \"9/12.\" This information was based on a Washington Post news story.", "The IRS itself confirmed in a press release that the groups targeted for scrutiny did not solely consist of conservative organizations": "but included organizations of all political views.", "The expert": "s analysis mentions that the IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants' political views and activities, including some broad descriptions aimed at conservatives. This suggests that conservative groups were indeed a target of scrutiny, but it does not provide specific numbers or percentages.", "Progress Texas did not provide any further evidence or information to support their claim that two": "thirds of the groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative. The report and the story they referenced did not describe the other 202 groups, and the organization did not respond to requests for relevant information."}
