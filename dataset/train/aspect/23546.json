{"Comparison to federal data": "The expert compared the claim made by GOP state Rep. Mark Batinick about California's poverty rate to federal data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This involved examining the poverty figures nationally and using the official source for national poverty estimates, the Current Population Survey.", "Poverty rate in California": "The expert analyzed the poverty rate in California based on the federal data. They found that California's share of those living below the poverty line is just over 12%, which contradicts Batinick's claim of \"30% or a third of the country's people\" living in poverty in California.", "Supplemental poverty measure": "The expert also considered the supplemental poverty measure released by the Census, which takes into account cost-of-living factors such as taxes, housing, medical costs, and non-cash benefits. While this measure gave California a larger share of those living in poverty nationwide, it still fell well below Batinick's claim, with the math working out to just below 17%.", "Consideration of food insecurity": "The expert suggested looking at \"food insecurity\" as a separate federal ranking measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This aspect provides additional insight into poverty levels and can contribute to verifying the authenticity of the claim, although the specific findings regarding food insecurity were not mentioned in the given information."}
