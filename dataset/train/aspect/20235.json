{"The expert cited the existence of a controversial state jet fuel tax exemption that has benefitted Delta Air lines for nearly a decade and was made permanent by lawmakers and the governor in 2012": "This suggests that the claim of Georgia having one of the nation's highest jet fuel taxes is supported by the fact that a tax exemption was put in place for Delta, indicating that the tax rate must have been significant enough to warrant such an exemption.", "The expert mentioned Delta executives": "opposition to removing the tax exemption, stating that they believe the existing jet fuel taxes are already high enough and that further increase could jeopardize Atlanta airport's competitive status. This suggests that Delta, as a major player in the aviation industry, has firsthand knowledge and experience of the tax rates in various states, including Georgia, and their potential impact on competitiveness.", "The expert referred to information from Airlines for America": "the airline trade association, which Delta officials cited to back up their claim that Georgia already has one of the nation's highest jet fuel tax rates. This suggests that the claim is supported by data and analysis from a reputable industry source.", "The expert mentioned the ranking of states for jet fuel taxes by the Tax Foundation in June 2014": "which found that Georgia was 11th nationally at 15 cents based on its combined effective jet fuel tax rate and fees per gallon. This suggests that an objective analysis by a respected organization supports the claim that Georgia's jet fuel taxes are relatively high compared to other states."}
