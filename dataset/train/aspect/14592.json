{"The claim made by Kamala Harris during the debate is that Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez has only passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress": "and that was to rename a post office.", "To verify the authenticity of this claim": "Harris' campaign pointed to Sanchez's record on congress.gov, which shows that Sanchez has indeed sponsored only one bill that became law, which was the 2001 measure to rename an Orange County Post Office.", "Additionally": "it was found that Sanchez has co-sponsored 179 bills that have become law, indicating her involvement in the legislative process.", "It is also mentioned that the naming of post offices is a common practice in Congress": "as these bills are typically non-controversial and easily pass. This further supports the claim made by Harris."}
