{"The expert references historical evidence from the Watergate investigation": "including the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and the subsequent FBI investigation that led to convictions and Nixon's resignation. This historical context supports the claim that the FBI reported to the Department of Justice during Watergate.", "The expert highlights the organizational structure of the Department of Justice": "specifically the FBI's position under the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General. This organizational chart serves as evidence that the FBI is expected to report to the Department of Justice as standard operating procedure.", "The expert mentions the development of norms in the post": "Watergate era, which emphasize the separation between the president and investigative matters, as well as the expectation that the FBI director should avoid involvement in political matters. This suggests that reporting to the Department of Justice is a part of these established norms.", "The expert mentions instances from the FBI": "s history under J. Edgar Hoover where the FBI dealt directly with the White House, even against the orders of Attorneys General. While this may seem contradictory, it supports the claim that the FBI's reporting to the Department of Justice during Watergate was not merely a matter of courtesy, but rather a standard practice."}
