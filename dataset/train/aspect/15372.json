This confirms that the merger resulted in the consolidation of certain seed and pesticide markets.", "European regulators had already approved the Bayer": "Monsanto merger before the Justice Department's decision. This supports the claim that the merger was approved by regulatory bodies.", "Industry analyst Jonas Oxgaard estimated that Bayer now controls approximately one": "fourth (25%) of the world's seeds and pesticides market.
