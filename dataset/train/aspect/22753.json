{"Rep": "Keith Ellison's use of Thomas Jefferson's Quran during his ceremonial swearing-in as the first Muslim Congressman verifies the claim indirectly, as it suggests that Jefferson had knowledge of and respect for the Muslim faith.", "The fact that Thomas Jefferson owned a copy of the Quran": "as part of his extensive collection of books, supports the claim that he had an interest in studying Islam and understanding its teachings.", "The mention of Jefferson": "s advocacy for war against the Islamic \"Barbary\" states, specifically Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripoli, further confirms his involvement in sending the U.S. Navy to subdue Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean.", "The acquisition of Jefferson": "s Quran by the Library of Congress in 1815 as part of a larger collection, which Jefferson sold to replace the congressional library burned by British troops during the War of 1812, provides additional evidence of the authenticity of the claim."}
