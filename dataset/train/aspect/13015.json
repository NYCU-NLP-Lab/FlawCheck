Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) does not track removals by specific gang affiliation, making it difficult to determine the number of MS-13 gang members specifically deported.", "ICE does target MS": "13 members for arrest and removal based on their immigration violations.", "In fiscal year 2017": "a total of 5,396 gang members were removed, but it is unclear how many of them were MS-13 members.", "From October 1": "2017, to December 16, 2017, a total of 1,082 gang members were removed, but again, the number of MS-13 members specifically is unknown."}
