{"The claim is based on a quote from Weld during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session and a CNN interview": "both of which were conducted on September 10th.", "The claim states that": "76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates,\" but the actual poll conducted by Suffolk University only sampled 1,000 likely voters, not all voters in the United States.", "The claim misrepresents the question asked in the poll": "which inquired about including a third-party candidate in the debates if certified by a majority of state ballots, rather than specifically mentioning Johnson-Weld by name.", "Two other polls that mentioned Johnson": "Weld or Johnson alone found lower figures of support compared to the Suffolk University poll, indicating that the claim's assertion of 76 percent support may be inflated."}
