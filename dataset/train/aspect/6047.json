This aspect verifies the claim's authenticity by emphasizing the absence of any official records or actions against Biden.", "Inappropriate conduct accusations limited to adults": "The expert's verdict mentions that while Biden has been accused by some adult women of unwanted touching in public and a former Senate staffer accused him of sexual assault, there have never been any credible accusations of Biden engaging in inappropriate conduct with children.
