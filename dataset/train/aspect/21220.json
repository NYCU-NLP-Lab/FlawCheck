{"Analysis of HUD housing data": "The expert examined the total number of people using HUD subsidized housing, as reported by HUD's website. They found that there were about 9.6 million people using HUD housing in 2009, the most recent year for which data was available.", "Comparison with the number of illegal immigrants": "The expert compared the 60% claim with the estimated number of illegal immigrants in the United States. According to a 2010 Pew Hispanic Center estimate, there were about 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the country. The expert calculated that if the 60% claim were accurate, there would be about 5.8 million illegal immigrants living in HUD properties.", "Expert opinion": "The expert sought the opinion of Chris Herbert, Research Director at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, and the Furman Center For Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. Both experts expressed skepticism about the claim, stating that they had not heard any discussion of such widespread practices.", "Confirmation from HUD": "The expert contacted HUD directly and spoke to a spokesperson. The spokesperson confirmed that there was no published report on illegal immigrants in HUD housing and stated that the claim of 60% being illegal immigrants was \"nonsensical.\" The spokesperson also explained that applicants for subsidized housing must be citizens or legal immigrants, and undocumented immigrants are only allowed to live in subsidized housing if at least one member of the household is in the country legally."}
