{"Comparison of images": "The expert's verdict mentions that the authenticity of the claim was verified by comparing two images - one from the Patriots' visit to the White House in 2015 with President Obama, and another from their visit in 2017 with President Trump. The images visually show a difference in the turnout, supporting the claim.", "Retweets and public response": "The expert's verdict mentions that the tweet containing the images was retweeted almost 49,000 times. This indicates that the images gained significant attention and public response, further adding to the authenticity of the claim.", "Patriots": "response: The Patriots themselves responded to the claim, pointing out that the photos lacked context. They clarified that in 2017, more than 40 staff members were seated on the South Lawn instead of lining the staircases, which made the turnout appear smaller. The Patriots' response provides additional evidence to verify the claim.", "Additional image comparisons": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Patriots also shared additional images comparing their visit to President George W. Bush in 2004. These images were included to provide a fair comparison and support the claim that the turnout in 2017 was smaller than previous visits. The inclusion of these additional image comparisons strengthens the authenticity of the claim."}
