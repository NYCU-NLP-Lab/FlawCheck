{"The claim inaccurately states that Florida state senators are pushing a program that allows prescription drugs from China without FDA inspection": "The legislation actually calls for importing drugs from Canada, not China.", "The ad from The Partnership for Safe Medicines": "which made the claim, is supported by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a lobbying group that includes major drug companies.", "The claim lacks evidence to support the idea that Florida legislators want to import drugs from China without oversight from the FDA": "The FDA has the power to regulate any drugs sold in the country, regardless of their origin.", "The legislation in question": "SB 1528, includes safety provisions that require the imported drugs to meet FDA standards and subject the entities involved to state rules. The ad fails to mention these provisions."}
