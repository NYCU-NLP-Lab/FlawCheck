{"The claim is specific and measurable": "The claim states that the post-1994 governments have bought less than 7% of the targeted 30% of land meant for redistribution over a period of 25 years. This provides a clear and quantifiable measure to verify.", "Historical data analysis": "To verify the claim, experts would need to analyze historical data on land purchases by the South African governments since 1994. This would involve examining official records, government reports, and other relevant sources to determine the actual percentage of land bought for redistribution.", "Comparison with target goals": "Experts would also need to compare the percentage of land bought with the targeted goal of 30% over 25 years. This would involve examining official policies, land redistribution programs, and government statements to assess whether the actual land purchases align with the stated goals.", "Cross": "referencing with independent sources: To ensure the authenticity of the claim, experts would need to cross-reference the information with independent sources. This could involve consulting academic studies, reports from non-governmental organizations, or other reputable sources that provide data on land redistribution in South Africa. By comparing multiple sources, experts can verify the accuracy of the claim."}
