{"Statements from civil rights legend Julian Bond": "The claim is supported by a statement made by Julian Bond on \"The Colbert Report\" that the incidents of threats against President Obama are greater than for any other president in modern times.", "Efforts to contact Julian Bond": "PolitiFact Georgia attempted to reach out to Julian Bond to verify the claim but was unsuccessful. They tried contacting him through the American Program Bureau and American University, where he is an adjunct professor, but were unable to establish contact.", "Similar claims from other sources": "The claim is supported by the fact that others have made similar claims about threats to President Obama, indicating that the claim is not isolated and comes from multiple sources.", "Comparison with previous presidents": "The claim is further examined by comparing the number of threats against President Obama with his White House predecessor, George W. Bush. While an author estimated a 400 percent increase in threats against Obama, the then-Secret Service Director, Mark Sullivan, stated that the threats were at the same level as the previous two presidents at that point in their administrations."}
