{"The TikTok video by Jordan Lewis showed a supposed hack for getting free food from Chick": "fil-A by saying \"my pleasure\" before the employee could say it. However, it was later revealed to be a prank video, and Lewis appeared to possibly even do the voice of the supposed employee.", "Other TikTok videos from Lewis were also identified as pranks": "indicating a pattern of creating prank content for fun.", "The claim that saying": "my pleasure\" to a Chick-fil-A employee entitles the customer to free food is debunked. The video suggested that saying it before an employee can get the words out would work as a trick, but it is unlikely to be successful.", "The idea of customers saying": "my pleasure\" for free Chick-fil-A menu items had been circulating on social media for a few years. Some customers believed it could earn them a free ice cream cone or other dessert, but this was not true. However, Chick-fil-A did have a promotion in 2016 called the \"Cell Phone Coop\" challenge, where families who placed their phones in a designated coop during their meal could earn an ice cream cone if they abstained from checking their phones."}
