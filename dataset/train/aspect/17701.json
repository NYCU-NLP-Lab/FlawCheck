{"The expert": "s verdict is based on the response of Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, who stated that there is no basis for the claim that a president under impeachment is prohibited from issuing pardons.", "The misconception may have originated from a misreading of the U": "S. Constitution. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states that the President has the power to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment. However, this does not mean that pardons cannot be issued during a presidential impeachment. The phrase is widely understood to prohibit pardons that restore the standing of a Federal officer who has been impeached and removed from their position.", "The claim is deemed false because there are very few limits on the presidential pardon power": "and impeachment does not automatically prohibit the president from issuing pardons.", "The sources referenced include John M": "Crewdson's article \"The President's Power to Pardon Is Debated\" from The New York Times in 1974 and the National Constitution Center's information on Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution."}
