{"Analysis of scientific evidence": "The expert may have examined scientific studies or research papers to determine whether there is any evidence to support the claim that farmers are injecting fruits and vegetables with oxytocin. They would have looked for reliable sources and evaluated the methodology and results of these studies.", "Evaluation of agricultural practices": "The expert may have considered common agricultural practices and regulations to determine whether injecting fruits and vegetables with oxytocin is a common or accepted practice.
