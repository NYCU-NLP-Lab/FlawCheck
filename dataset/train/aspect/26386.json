{"The original graphic": "The expert's verdict mentions that the original graphic displayed during the ESPN broadcast did not list porn star Johnny Sins as the favorite actor of player Jack Buening. Instead, it stated that Buening's favorite school subject is science. This aspect indicates that the claim is not authentic.", "Video evidence": "The expert's verdict refers to a video of Buening's appearance at the plate during Nevada's game against Northern California. This video, which can be seen at the 11:10 mark, supports the expert's claim that the graphic listing Johnny Sins as Buening's favorite actor is doctored and not a genuine screenshot from an ESPN broadcast.", "Twitter user admission": "The expert's verdict mentions that the doctored graphic was created by a Twitter user named Big Heatdaddy. Although the original tweets are no longer available, the Twitter account Lookout Landing posted a screenshot reportedly showing Big Heatdaddy admitting that the image was fake and apologizing to Buening. This aspect further confirms the inauthenticity of the claim.", "News articles": "The expert's verdict cites two news articles, one from The Sun and another from 12Up, which discuss the incident and the fact that porn stars were fooled by the photoshopped ESPN graphic. These articles serve as additional sources of information that support the expert's conclusion that the claim is not true."}
