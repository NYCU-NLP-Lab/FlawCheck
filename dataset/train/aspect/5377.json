{"Assembly Bill A": "3202: This separate legislation sponsored by Greenwald aims to allocate the additional tax revenue generated from the increased tax rate towards higher property tax relief payments. This aspect further supports the claim by demonstrating that the increased tax revenue will be spent by the government.", "Veto by Gov": "Chris Christie: Governor Christie vetoed Assembly Bill A-3202 and conditionally vetoed A-3201. His veto indicates that he recognizes the proposed legislation as a tax increase, contradicting Greenwald's claim.", "Expert analysis by PolitiFact New Jersey": "The experts at PolitiFact New Jersey found that Greenwald's claim of it not being a tax increase doesn't make sense.
