{"The law in question": "titled the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act, bans \"dismemberment abortions\" and makes the provision of such a procedure a felony crime.", "The law allows husbands to sue doctors who carry out abortions for civil damages and obtain injunctions preventing those physicians from performing additional procedures": "3. Parents and legal guardians are able to sue to prevent minors from having abortions, raising concerns for victims of sexual abuse and incest.", "The law explicitly states that civil damages cannot be awarded to a plaintiff if the pregnancy resulted from the criminal conduct of the plaintiff": "meaning that a rapist cannot sue his victim and reap any benefits from doing so."}
