{"Multiple old pictures and videos were shared on social media claiming to represent the ongoing farmers": "protests. This suggests that the claim may not be based on recent events.", "The Facebook page": "Khari Khari News' posted a photo of thousands of people sitting on the road, which drew over 1,000 likes. However, the authenticity of this photo is questionable as it may not be a recent image from the farmers' protests.", "A reverse": "image search led to the discovery that the same photograph was uploaded by Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan on March 11, 2020. This indicates that the photo represents a farmers' long-march led by CPI(M) in Maharashtra, which took place two years ago.", "Media outlets": "such as the Bengali news website 'guruchandali' and a Tamil news outlet, published the same photo as recent scenes from the farmers' protest. However, this further confirms that the image is not from the ongoing peasants' movement and has been falsely shared."}
