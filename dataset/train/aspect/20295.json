{"Analysis of Texas Freedom Network": "s report: The expert examined a report by the Texas Freedom Network, which estimated that 25.1 percent of the state's school districts in 2015-16 did not teach sex education in their secondary schools. This report provided statistical evidence to support the claim.", "Comparison to previous data": "The expert also noted that the Texas Freedom Network found that only 2 percent of school districts were not teaching sex education in 2007-08. By comparing these two sets of data, the expert was able to assess the change in the number of schools offering sex education over time.", "Survey of Texas school districts": "The Texas Freedom Network conducted a survey of 138 Texas school districts, representative of the diversity in geography, enrollment, and district type. The survey asked about the materials and programs used for sex education in middle and high schools, providing firsthand information on the availability of sex education in these districts.", "Examination of curriculum and policies": "The survey specifically asked for copies of class schedules and district policies related to sex education. This allowed the expert to assess whether the districts had obtained materials from crisis pregnancy centers or alternative-to-abortion organizations, and whether they covered topics such as sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, or abortion. This examination provided additional evidence to verify the claim."}
