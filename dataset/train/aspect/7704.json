{"The size discrepancy": "The expert noted that the sun and moon appeared much larger in the image than they would in reality when viewed from the ground. This suggested that the image was not genuine.", "Inconsistent positioning": "The eclipse in the image appeared to be happening in front of the clouds, despite the fact that the sun and moon are much farther away than the Earth's cloud cover. This inconsistency raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with a real eclipse": "The expert provided a genuine photograph of an annular eclipse posted by NASA in 2012 for comparison. By contrasting the real eclipse with the image in question, it became evident that the latter was not an accurate representation of a solar eclipse.", "Composite image evidence": "It was discovered that the image claiming to show a solar eclipse over the ocean was a composite of at least two different photographs. The ocean picture was originally posted by photographer Art Lewis on Flickr in 2009, and the eclipse was added to it later. The presence of a composite image further supported the conclusion that the claim was not authentic."}
