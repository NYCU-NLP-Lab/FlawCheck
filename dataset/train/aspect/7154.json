{"The claim is outdated": "The expert's verdict states that the meme claiming vacancies in the Trump administration was posted on September 15, 2019, but it is a cropped version of a meme posted on April 9, 2019. This indicates that the claim is not up-to-date and may no longer be accurate.", "Inaccurate information": "The expert's verdict mentions that the meme circulating on Facebook includes some inaccurate information regarding vacancies in the Trump administration. This suggests that the claim may not be entirely truthful or reliable.", "Positions have been filled": "The expert's verdict states that four out of the seven positions mentioned in the claim have been filled on a permanent basis. This contradicts the claim's assertion that these positions are vacant.", "Acting roles": "The expert's verdict mentions that three of the positions cited in the claim are still occupied by individuals in an \"acting\" role. This implies that while there may not be permanent appointees for these positions, they are not entirely vacant as the claim suggests."}
