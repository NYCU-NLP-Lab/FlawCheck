{"The development of a magnetic hair": "sized robot: The claim states that Purdue University engineers developed a magnetic hair-sized robot. This aspect verifies the authenticity of the claim by providing information about the existence of the robot.", "Testing on mice and pigs": "The expert's verdict mentions that the robots were tested on anesthetized mice and colons surgically removed from pigs. This aspect confirms that the experiments were conducted on animals, providing evidence of the claim's authenticity.", "Magnetic locomotion and capabilities": "The microrobot is described as being outfitted with magnets that interact with an external magnetic field to provide locomotion. It is mentioned that the robot can climb inclines and move in fluid movements, even in complex and unstructured terrains like the colon. This aspect establishes the technical capabilities of the robot, supporting the claim's authenticity.", "Drug delivery potential": "The expert's verdict mentions that the microrobot has the ability to release a pharmaceutical drug payload. The researchers coated the microrobot in a fluorescent-colored mock drug to test its diffusion in a natural environment. This aspect demonstrates the potential application of the robot in drug delivery, further validating the claim."}
