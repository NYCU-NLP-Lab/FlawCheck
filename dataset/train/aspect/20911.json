{"Testimony from Smartmatic spokesperson": "The spokesperson for Smartmatic, a company accused of being involved in the Myanmar elections, categorically denied any involvement in the election process. They stated that Smartmatic had never provided any election technology or services to authorities in Myanmar.", "Lack of response from Dominion": "Despite repeated requests for comment, Dominion, another company accused of being involved in the Myanmar elections, did not respond. This lack of response suggests that they have no connection to the election and further undermines the claim.", "Election process in Myanmar": "The election process in Myanmar involved paper ballots that were counted by hand. This is evidenced by photos and videos from election day. The absence of Dominion and Smartmatic equipment in the election process contradicts the claim.", "Expert analysis": "The expert's verdict, as provided in the statement, dismisses the claim as false. The expert points out the lack of evidence and highlights the social media echo chamber that perpetuated the claim. This expert analysis further supports the authenticity verification process."}
