{"Legislative Republicans": "criticism of the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board: The expert's verdict mentions that Republicans have accused the board of unfair treatment of their candidates during recall elections and have criticized its implementation of a voter ID law. This criticism suggests that the claim about the board considering Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions could be part of the Republicans' argument against the board.", "Governor Scott Walker": "s support for scrapping the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board: The expert's verdict states that Governor Walker urged legislative Republicans to fast-track a bill to replace the accountability board. This indicates that the claim might have been used by Governor Walker to support his stance on reforming the board.", "Evidence provided by Walker": "s spokeswoman: The expert's verdict mentions that Walker's spokeswoman referred to a report on WISN TV and a story on Politico to support the claim. These sources supposedly provide evidence that the Government Accountability Board would accept signatures from Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as long as they were properly dated and included a Wisconsin address. This evidence is presented to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Fact": "checking of the claim by PolitiFact: The expert's verdict refers to PolitiFact's evaluation of the claim as \"Mostly False.\" This indicates that PolitiFact conducted a fact-checking process to verify the claim's authenticity. The fact-checking involved examining a video from the conservative MacIver Institute, which allegedly showed the Government Accountability Board stating that they would accept signatures from Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler. The fact-checking process revealed that the board would flag such signatures for more review but not automatically count them towards the required total for a recall election."}
