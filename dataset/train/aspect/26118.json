{"The presence of a doctored image": "The expert found through a Google reverse image search that the photo in the misleading Facebook posts was a manipulated version of an image from a 2013 article by Tempo, a reputable news group in Indonesia. This discovery suggests that the claim was based on a falsified image.", "Lack of credible sources": "The expert noted that there were no official announcements or evidence from Prabowo Subianto's political party, Gerindra, regarding an alliance with the banned communists. The absence of any declaration on Gerindra's website, Twitter account, or Facebook page indicates that the claim lacks support from credible sources.", "Contradictory context of the original image": "The original photo from the Tempo article showed Subianto holding a marker next to a whiteboard with figures related to tax revenue and gross domestic product. There was no mention of any political party or communism in the original context. This contradiction suggests that the claim misrepresents the purpose and content of the original image.", "Legal implications and consequences": "The expert mentioned that any association with communism in Indonesia can lead to criminal charges under specific laws. The law cited in the expert's verdict highlights the strict prohibition of activities related to communism. This aspect emphasizes the seriousness of the claim and its potential legal ramifications."}
