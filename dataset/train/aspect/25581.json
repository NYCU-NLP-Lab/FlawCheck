{"The claim made by Senator Marco Rubio is that President Barack Obama could": "basically\" legalize all immigrants here illegally \"by the sign of a pen.\"", "The expert": "s verdict suggests that such a move by President Obama would violate the country's separation of powers, as Congress is responsible for determining the laws governing legal residence in the country.", "The expert also points out that executive orders tend to be focused and not open": "ended over time, making it unlikely that Obama could grant all-out citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants via an executive order.", "However": "the expert acknowledges that in 2012, Obama did announce a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for temporary status. This policy has been seen by Rubio as essentially legalizing this group of illegal immigrants and making it harder for any legislation to pass."}
