The foundation cites the bureau's household surveys as the basis for determining the uninsured rates in Texas and other states.", "Uninsured rate in Texas": "The expert states that according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Texas had the highest uninsured rate among all states, with 24 percent of residents lacking health insurance. This data supports the claim that Texas has a significant number of uninsured people.", "Population comparison": "The expert mentions that Texas had more than 6.1 million uninsured residents in 2011, as reported by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
