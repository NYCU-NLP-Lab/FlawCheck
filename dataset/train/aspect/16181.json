{"The posting was shared by Instagram accounts such as": "lulurecruitment.co, which has no affiliation with the real Lululemon. This indicates that the claim did not originate from an official Lululemon source.", "Lululemon": "s social media team responded to queries about the scam, confirming that the offer was not legitimate and that their ambassadors are chosen individually by their stores rather than through social media channels. This official response further verifies the inauthenticity of the claim.", "The scam required potential": "ambassadors\" to have a minimum of 150 followers, which is a relatively low requirement for a social media position with a well-known brand like Lululemon. This indicates that the offer was not consistent with the usual requirements for such positions, adding to the suspicion of its authenticity.", "The scam followed a strategy similar to other": "like farming\" social media schemes, where fraudsters offer something of value in exchange for social media engagement. This pattern suggests that the claim was not a genuine opportunity but rather a tactic to quickly build a following and potentially sell the account to a third party."}
