{"The expert": "s verdict states that former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed that President Trump \"immediately discontinued\" an aid program to Central America.", "The expert provides evidence that the Obama": "era aid program was actually reduced by only about 23 percent during Trump's first two years in office.", "It is mentioned that illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels before the Obama aid program commenced": "indicating that the claim of discontinuing the program causing surging immigration is not accurate.", "The expert also mentions that Trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely": "further undermining the claim of immediate discontinuation."}
