{"Lack of specific evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights that the claim made by Scott Fitzgerald lacks specific evidence to support it. Fitzgerald's spokesman initially admitted that the claim \"looks wrong,\" indicating a lack of concrete data or sources to back up the statement.", "Misinterpretation of data": "The expert's verdict points out that Fitzgerald's citation of an analysis by USA Today on the percentage of Americans' income from the government is irrelevant to the claim. The data provided in the analysis does not address the percentage of individual Wisconsinites receiving government assistance, which is the focus of the claim.", "Revised statement": "Upon further inquiry, Fitzgerald revised his claim from \"one in two\" to \"one in six\" Wisconsin residents receiving government handouts. This revision suggests a lack of clarity and accuracy in the initial claim.", "Inconclusive supporting evidence": "The expert's verdict mentions that Fitzgerald's spokesman provided an article from USA Today analyzing state data on government anti-poverty programs serving one in six Americans. However, the article does not specifically mention Wisconsin, leaving the supporting evidence inconclusive in verifying the claim for the state."}
