{"The claim originated from a post on the anonymous messaging board 4chan": "made by a user named \"John\" who allegedly predicted the Las Vegas Strip mass shooting.", "The post by": "John\" warned people to stay away from Las Vegas due to a coming deadly attack, mentioning a \"high incident project\" that was due to take place soon.", "The messages posted by": "John\" did not provide specific details about the catastrophe but mentioned vaguely that some kind of incident would occur the following day in Las Vegas or Henderson, with a mention of \"three black vans parked next to either.\"", "There is a possibility that the post by": "John\" could have been a troll or an attempt to create fear, as it was made on the day before the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack."}
