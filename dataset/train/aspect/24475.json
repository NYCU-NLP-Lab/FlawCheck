{"Lack of evidence": "The expert's verdict highlights the exhaustive search conducted on newspaper and television transcripts, which found no evidence to support Trump's claim of thousands of people in New Jersey cheering after the 9/11 attacks. This lack of evidence undermines the authenticity of the claim.", "Unsubstantiated mentions": "The expert's verdict mentions two uncorroborated and unsourced mentions of celebrations in Jersey City. These mentions do not provide any credible evidence to support Trump's claim and further weaken its authenticity.", "Rumors and unfounded allegations": "The verdict also mentions rumors and allegations of rooftop celebrations by Muslims in Jersey City, but these were found to be unfounded and lacking any substantiation. The presence of rumors and baseless allegations casts doubt on the credibility of the claim.", "Chain emails and media influence": "The expert's verdict highlights how rumors of Muslim or Arab-Americans cheering the attacks were spread through chain emails and perpetuated by shock jock Howard Stern's radio show. This suggests that the claim may have been influenced by misinformation and media sensationalism rather than verifiable facts."}
