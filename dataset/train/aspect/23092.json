Senate committee hearing on border security is genuine and was taken on April 9, 2019.", "The claim that": "not a single Democrat\" was present during the hearing is inaccurate and misleading.", "The empty seats were not specific to Democrats but were a result of most lawmakers": "including both Republicans and Democrats, being absent due to a vote on an unrelated matter.", "Senators have multiple responsibilities on Capitol Hill": "and attending hearings can sometimes overlap with other duties such as casting votes, which explains the absence of lawmakers during the final minutes of the hearing."}
