{"The claim is supported by a statement made by state Rep": "David Crowley, who asserts that child care costs account for 24% of a Wisconsin family's budget. This statement provides a direct source for the claim.", "The claim is backed up by a 2018 United Way report that focuses on the population group known as ALICE": "Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed). The report states that child care accounts for 24% of the Wisconsin family budget, which exceeds the 10% affordability threshold established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This report serves as additional evidence supporting the claim.", "The claim is corroborated by the fact that the state Department of Children and Families does not collect data on child care costs": "Instead, they direct inquiries to advocacy groups, suggesting that there is a reliance on external sources for information on child care expenses.", "The claim aligns with the federal benchmark for affordable child care": "which states that costs should be equivalent to 7% of total household income. The claim's assertion that child care costs account for 24% of a Wisconsin family's budget indicates a significant burden on families, exceeding the recommended affordability threshold."}
