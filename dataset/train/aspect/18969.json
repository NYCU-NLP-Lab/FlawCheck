{"Definition of a glacier": "The expert explains that the definition of a glacier can vary depending on different guidelines and standards. The U.S. Geological Survey defines a glacier as a body of ice with an area of at least 0.1 kilometers squared, while the emerging global standard is a minimum of 1 hectare (100 meters by 100 meters).", "Lack of data on historical glacier numbers": "The expert states that there is no available data on the global number of glaciers in 1948, the year Al Gore was born. Reliable satellite monitoring to map glaciers only began in the mid-1980s, so there are no snapshots from space in 1948 to determine the number of glaciers at that time.", "Current estimates of glacier numbers": "According to the Randolph Glacier Inventory, there are 197,654 glaciers that are at least 1 hectare in size. This number is higher than the claim mentioned in the Facebook post, which states that only 130,000 glaciers remain. Additionally, there are thousands of \"missing\" glaciers that are too small to be included in inventories.", "Changing and expanding glacier inventories": "The expert explains that inventories of glaciers are constantly changing as more glaciers are being mapped. One database from the National Snow and Ice Data Center lists 306,865 glaciers, indicating that the numbers can increase over time as more data becomes available."}
