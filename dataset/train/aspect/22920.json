{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the analysis of the social media posts and captions accompanying the photos": "The expert noted that the misleading posts on Facebook and Twitter falsely claimed that the photos showed Australian bushfires from above the clouds.", "The second aspect involved investigating the origins of the photos through a reverse image search on Google": "This search revealed that the first photo was actually posted on Instagram in July 2018 by user @nprovince101. The post was geotagged to Honolulu, Hawaii, and the caption clearly indicated that it was a sunset photo taken at 30,000-feet altitude.", "The third aspect involved cross": "referencing the information provided by the Instagram user, Nathan Province, with previous fact-check reports. AFP had previously interviewed Province regarding a false claim that the same photo showed an aerial view of clouds above California during the 2018 forest fires. Province confirmed that the photo was taken over the big island of Hawaii and not related to the Australian bushfires.", "The fourth aspect involved highlighting the timeline discrepancy": "The expert pointed out that both photos had been circulating online since at least 2016 and 2018, well before the 2019-2020 bushfires broke out in Australia. This further confirmed that the claim of the photos showing Australian bushfires was false."}
