{"Lack of concrete evidence": "The expert points out that there is a lack of evidence to support the claim of live mice being eaten as a popular dish in China. The video circulating on the internet does not show anyone actually consuming the live mice, and other similar videos also lack credibility.", "Suspicious qualities of videos": "The videos that claim to show people eating live mice have suspicious qualities. They often end abruptly before showing anyone chewing or swallowing the mice, raising doubts about their authenticity.", "Lack of first": "hand information: The expert mentions that many websites and accounts repeat the same general claims about the dish without providing any additional first-hand information. This lack of first-hand accounts makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Skeptical testimonies": "The closest the expert came to finding a first-hand account was a skeptical testimony posted on a message board. The person who shared their experience had heard about the dish on a talk radio show, but there was no concrete evidence to support their claim."}
