{"Evidence of voter fraud in specific voting districts": "The claim highlights instances where Obama received 100% of the votes in certain voting districts, with no votes recorded for Romney. This is presented as evidence of voter fraud.", "Statistical and mathematical impossibilities": "The claim argues that the recorded vote counts are statistically and mathematically impossible, suggesting that fraud must have occurred. The expert, however, refutes this by explaining that a vote count adding up to zero is not a mathematical impossibility, and there is no such thing as a statistical impossibility.", "High voter turnout percentages": "The claim mentions unusually high voter turnout percentages in certain counties, such as a 158% turnout in a polling location in St. Lucie County, FL, and a 141% turnout in Palm Beach County, FL. These high percentages are presented as evidence of fraudulent voting.", "Correlation between Photo ID requirements and election outcomes": "The claim asserts that Obama won in states that did not require a Photo ID to vote, while he lost in states that did require a Photo ID. This correlation is presented as evidence of voter fraud, suggesting that the lack of Photo ID requirements allowed for fraudulent votes."}
