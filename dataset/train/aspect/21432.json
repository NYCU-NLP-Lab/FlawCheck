{"The claim is based on a tweet from Claude Taylor": "a travel photographer who claims to have worked as a staffer in the Clinton White House. This tweet states that an independent journalist, who has been reliable in the past, has two sources indicating that Trump is considering options, including resignation.", "The claim is considered hearsay since it is based on an unnamed source quoting other unnamed sources": "Without further information, it is impossible to verify the claim.", "The claim seems to be linked to the controversy surrounding Michael Flynn": "Trump's former National Security Adviser, who resigned after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his meetings with a Russian envoy.", "The claim is contrasted with the fact that President Trump has made no public indication of any intent to resign": "and the resignation of a U.S. president has only occurred once in history, with Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal."}
