{"Lack of citation in the book": "The quote attributed to George Patton does not have a citation in the book \"The Unknown Patton\" by Charles Province, which raises doubts about its authenticity.", "Alternate sources": "Snopes, a fact-checking website, found that the quote appeared unattributed to Patton in a 1948 book by Stuart Chase called \"The Proper Study of Mankind.\" Additionally, Harry Truman's diary entry in 1945 mentioned a similar sentiment about liberal politicians, but without attributing it to Patton.", "Virginia Military Institute Archives": "The archives and records management specialist at the Virginia Military Institute stated that there is no record of Patton saying the quote, making it unlikely that it originated from him.", "Lack of original source material": "Media and governmental relations consultant Brain Sobel, who extensively researched Patton for his book \"The Fighting Pattons,\" has not found any original source material supporting the claim that Patton said the quote. Sobel also mentioned that while Patton had a general disdain for politics, he was ambivalent about it, further casting doubt on the attribution."}
