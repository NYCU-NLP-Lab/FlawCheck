{"Lack of credible sources": "The expert highlights that the only source for the claim of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings being arrested on suspicion of possessing child pornography is random social media posts and an article published on TorontoToday.net, a website known for spreading misinformation. The absence of credible sources raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim.", "Absence of official confirmation": "The expert points out that if the CEO of a major streaming service like Netflix had been arrested by the FBI, it would likely be accompanied by a press release from the FBI and would make headlines in credible media outlets. However, no such official confirmation or coverage from reputable sources can be found, further undermining the credibility of the claim.", "History of spreading hoaxes": "The expert reveals that TorontoToday.net, the website that published the article about Reed Hastings' arrest, has a history of spreading hoaxes. They have previously published false reports about the death of actor Chadwick Boseman and Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter. This history of spreading misinformation casts doubt on the reliability of the website and the accuracy of its claims.", "Removal and apology": "The expert highlights that TorontoToday.net deleted the original article about Hastings' arrest and issued an apology for any confusion caused. The fact that the website removed the article suggests that it may have realized the information was false or faced legal threats. This action further undermines the credibility of the claim."}
