{"The claim is supported by anecdotal evidence from State Rep": "Peter G. Palumbo, who stated that \"every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want [E-Verify].\"", "The expert conducted research to find polls specifically about E": "Verify, but found that there were few available. The one poll frequently cited by supporters of E-Verify was conducted by Rasmussen Reports, which asked respondents if businesses should be required to check the immigration status of potential employees using E-Verify. This poll found that 82% of respondents answered yes.", "The expert also found a poll conducted by Brown University": "s Taubman Center for Public Policy & American Institutions, but it did not ask any questions about E-Verify specifically. However, it did ask about a controversial law in Arizona that requires local police forces to enforce federal immigration laws, and 54% of Rhode Islanders in the survey were in favor of such a law.", "Overall": "the expert's research suggests that while there may not be a wide range of polls specifically about E-Verify, the available evidence, including the Rasmussen Reports poll, indicates that there is significant support for businesses being required to check the immigration status of potential employees using E-Verify."}
