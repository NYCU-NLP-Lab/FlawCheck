{"The claim that": "Denali\" is the Kenyan word for \"black power\" was debunked by experts who pointed out that \"Kenyan\" is not a language and that the official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili, neither of which have a translation for \"Denali.\"", "Multiple Swahili dictionaries were searched and no results were found for the word": "Denali.\" The Swahili word for \"black\" is \"mweusi,\" and the word for power is \"nguvu,\" which does not resemble \"Denali.\"", "The origin of the word": "Denali\" was traced back to the Koyukon language, a native language of Alaska. It was found that \"Denali\" is derived from the word \"Deenaalee\" in Koyukon, which approximately translates to \"the High One.\"", "The authenticity of the claim was further verified by confirming that the viral image used in the meme does depict the real Denali": "which is the tallest peak in North America."}
