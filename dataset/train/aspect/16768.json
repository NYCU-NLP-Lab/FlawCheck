{"Inconsistencies in the stated reason for the closures": "The expert points out that the claim raises questions about why multiple Walmart stores across different locations would need to be closed simultaneously for plumbing problems. This aspect questions the plausibility of the given explanation.", "Lack of notice and transparency": "Another aspect highlighted by the expert is the sudden closure of the stores with minimal notice to both customers and employees. This lack of transparency raises suspicions and adds to the skepticism surrounding the claim.", "Duration of the closures": "The extended duration of the closures, stated to be six months or more, is another aspect that is deemed implausible. This raises questions about why rectifying plumbing issues would require such a lengthy period, further fueling conspiracy theories.", "Absence of evidence": "The expert mentions the absence of required city work permits and marked septic or plumbing trucks at the affected locations. This lack of tangible evidence adds to the doubts regarding the authenticity of the claim and supports the notion of a hidden agenda behind the closures."}
