{"The personal experience of Pardeep Kaleka": "whose father was killed in a mass shooting, lends credibility to the claim. This firsthand experience gives him insight into the issue of gun violence and suggests that he has a genuine concern for its impact on American society.", "The statistic of 34 Americans murdered with guns each day is supported by research conducted by PolitiFact": "This independent fact-checking organization found that between 2005 and 2009, an average of 34 Americans were killed by guns daily, excluding suicides and accidents. This verification adds weight to the claim's accuracy.", "The claim made by Pardeep Kaleka is similar to one made by Democrat Cory Booker": "the mayor of Newark, N.J., on a nationally televised program. The fact-checking organization PolitiFact New Jersey rated Booker's claim as Mostly True, further supporting the credibility of Kaleka's statement.", "The campaign": "Demand a Plan, which Pardeep Kaleka was involved in, was launched by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national group that includes mayors from Oak Creek and Milwaukee. This campaign seeks to address gun violence and has the support of prominent political figures like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. The involvement of these influential individuals and organizations adds legitimacy to the claim and suggests that it is part of a broader movement to combat gun violence."}
