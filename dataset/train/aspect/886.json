{"The expert referenced a 2012 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities": "which gauged the income gap in each state and found that the richest 20 percent of Rhode Island households had incomes that were 7.5 times higher than the poorest 20 percent. This data suggests that Rhode Island is not one of the worst states for income equality.", "The expert mentioned the Gini coefficient": "which measures the concentration of wealth and is based on U.S. Census data. Although the specific value for Rhode Island's Gini coefficient was not provided, it implies that Rhode Island does not rank among the top states for income inequality.", "The expert referred to a Wikipedia page that cited Rhode Island as the 12th worst state in income inequality in 2010": "However, this still does not place Rhode Island in the top 10 worst states for income equality.", "The expert mentioned a report and data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute": "which compared each state's highest earners (the top 1 percent) with everyone else. According to this report, in 2012, the average income of Rhode Island's top 1% was $966,071, which is less than the national average of $1.3 million. This suggests that Rhode Island may not have the same level of income inequality as other states."}
