{"The law at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act": "which provides some protection for gun dealers and manufacturers from certain types of lawsuits when their products are misused.", "The law does not protect gun dealers who knowingly transfer a gun for criminal purposes or knowingly violate state or federal laws resulting in harm": "3. Gun manufacturers can be held liable if their product is defective and causes injury when used properly.", "While the gun industry does have some protections from liability": "it is not \"wholly protected\" and there are federal laws that restrict liability for other types of businesses as well."}
