{"The number of jobs destroyed": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim is based on the assertion that Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs. This specific number is one aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Factors contributing to job destruction": "The expert's verdict provides a detailed explanation of the factors that the Florida Democrats considered while estimating the number of jobs destroyed. These factors include expected teacher layoffs, cuts to local public employees, cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates, cuts to university spending, prison privatization, rejection of federal funding for high-speed rail, changes in funding for water districts, and refusal to meet with a biotech company. These factors are additional aspects that were used to verify the claim.", "Informal tally and shifting estimates": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Florida Democrats kept an informal tally of job destruction that shifts as time passes. Initially, the estimate was based on the governor's proposed budget, but it later changed to reflect the state budget as signed by the governor and other actions. This approach of maintaining a shifting estimate is another aspect employed to verify the claim.", "Approximation and rounding up": "The expert's verdict states that the Democrats always rounded up the estimate to 100,000, even if the actual count was slightly lower. This decision to round up the estimate is another aspect that was considered to verify the claim."}
