The expert found that Cavuto's estimate was slightly off, but the overall point remained the same - three years of Medicare spending would exceed the total wealth of the top 1 percent.", "The expert discovered that there are credible": "lower figures for Medicare spending. Medicare spending is reported in gross outlays and net outlays, with the latter taking into account premiums paid by Medicare users and recaptured inappropriate payments to providers. The net figure provides a better representation of the burden on taxpayers as a whole.", "The expert found a discrepancy in the gross outlay number reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services": "CMS) and the Medicare Trustees. The CMS reported $585.7 billion in gross spending for 2013, while the Trustees reported a slightly lower figure of $582.9 billion. The expert gave more weight to the Trustees' official report to Congress.", "The expert consulted the Kaiser Family Foundation": "s Medicare fact-sheet, which reported a net spending figure of $492 billion for 2013. According to a top Medicare analyst at Kaiser, the net amount better captures the burden on taxpayers as it factors in premiums paid by Medicare users and recaptured inappropriate payments to providers. This significantly lower figure contradicts Cavuto's estimate and further undermines his math."}
