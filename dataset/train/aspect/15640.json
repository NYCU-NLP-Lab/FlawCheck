{"Comparison of gun violence statistics": "The expert compared the claim that \"no other country comes even close to\" the \"nearly 40,000 people in this country\" lost to gun violence with actual data on firearm-related deaths in other countries. The expert found that Brazil and Mexico had higher firearm death rates than the United States, contradicting the claim.", "Analysis of specific time period": "The expert noted that the claim did not specify a time period for the nearly 40,000 people lost to gun violence. However, the expert provided data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for 2017, which showed that 39,773 people died from firearm-related injuries in the U.S. during that year.", "Evaluation of suicide and homicide rates": "The expert highlighted that 60% of the firearm-related deaths in the U.S. in 2017 were suicides, while 36.6% were homicides. This information helps provide a more nuanced understanding of the claim and the different factors contributing to gun violence.", "Examination of CDC research limitations": "The expert addressed the claim that the CDC is \"prevented from actually studying the issue [of gun violence] in the first place.\" The expert explained the Dickey Amendment, which restricts CDC funds from being used to advocate or promote gun control but clarified that the CDC still has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence. This aspect verifies the accuracy of the claim regarding CDC research limitations."}
