This contradicts the claim that they celebrated dragging Trump into war.", "False narrative and lack of factual merit": "The expert emphasizes that the conspiracy theory lacks factual merit and is based on a false narrative. The claim that Pelosi and Schumer contacted John Brennan to alert Iranian operatives and move civilians into the hit zone is unsupported and contradicted by known facts."}
