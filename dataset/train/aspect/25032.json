{"The claim is based on an analysis of Clinton": "s and Trump's economic proposals by Moody's Analytics, conducted by Mark Zandi, the chief economist of the firm. Zandi is a respected economist and has been quoted as an expert in previous fact checks by PolitiFact.", "The analysis projects that Clinton": "s policies would result in a gain of 10.4 million jobs nationwide during her first term, while Trump's policies would lead to a loss of nearly 3.5 million jobs. These estimates were reported by reputable news outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and CNN/Money.", "Clinton": "s campaign arrived at the specific figures for Wisconsin by distributing Zandi's estimated gains and losses among states in proportion to their population. While it cannot be assumed that the impact of the candidates' policies would be evenly distributed across states, Zandi and economist Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation consider the extrapolation to be reasonable and expect the numbers for Wisconsin to be roughly what Clinton stated.", "The claim was made by the official Hillary Clinton campaign account on Twitter": "which included a graphic stating that Clinton would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin, while Trump would cost the state 61,050 jobs. The tweet presents the numbers as evidence to support the claim."}
