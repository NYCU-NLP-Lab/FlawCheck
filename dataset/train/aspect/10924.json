{"Increase in autism diagnoses": "The expert's verdict acknowledges that there has been a rise in autism diagnoses in the past decade. However, it also highlights that scientists are unsure if this represents a true increase in cases or a change in diagnosis. This aspect verifies the claim that there has been an increase in the autism rate.", "Lack of connection between vaccines and autism": "The expert's verdict states that scientists and experts agree that the rise in autism cases is not related to the number of vaccines children are receiving. This aspect verifies that there is no causal relationship between vaccines and autism.", "Inflated number of vaccines": "The expert's verdict mentions that the claim states the number of vaccines has grown from 10 in 1983 to 46 in 2013, but these numbers are vastly inflated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2013 immunization schedule only lists 10 vaccines recommended for babies up to 24 months of age. This aspect verifies that the claim misrepresents the actual number of vaccines.", "Multiple doses and accurate counting": "The expert's verdict explains that the claim may be including vaccines administered in multiple doses, such as for measles, mumps, and rubella. It raises the question of whether counting every shot as a 'vaccine' is an accurate way to count. This aspect verifies the need to consider multiple doses and accuracy in counting when discussing the number of vaccines administered."}
