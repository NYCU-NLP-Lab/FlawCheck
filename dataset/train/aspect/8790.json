{"Grammatical errors in the article": "The expert notes that the article containing the claim is rife with grammatical errors, which raises doubts about its credibility. For example, the headline references \"50,000 African Student\" instead of \"50,000 African students,\" indicating a lack of attention to detail.", "Lack of evidence from major news outlets": "The expert searched on Nexis, a database of major news outlets, to find any reports on Trump approving scholarships for African students but found no evidence to support the claim. This suggests that reputable news sources have not reported on this development, casting doubt on its authenticity.", "Previous appearance of similar hoax": "The expert found that a similar hoax had appeared before in a different form. Another website had previously claimed that Trump approved \"fully government sponsored scholarships for international students ... in USA universities.\" This repetition of a false claim further undermines the credibility of the current claim.", "Lack of response from the source": "The expert attempted to contact the website studentapply.info, which published the claim, but did not receive a response. The lack of response raises concerns about the legitimacy of the claim and the credibility of the source."}
