{"Rep": "Jim Bridenstine claimed that President Obama spends 30 times more on global warming research than on weather forecasting and warning.", "Bridenstine": "s office provided evidence to support his claim, citing Obama's fiscal year 2014 request of $2.7 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program for climate change research.", "For weather forecasting and warning": "Bridenstine's office used $81.6 million for weather and air chemistry research under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.", "The comparison of these figures results in a 33": "to-1 ratio, which aligns with Bridenstine's statement. However, it was noted that Bridenstine's claim did not differentiate between weather forecasting and warning research and operations, which significantly affects the ratio.
