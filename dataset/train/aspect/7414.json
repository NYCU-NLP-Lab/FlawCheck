{"The claim is based on a chain email that has rapidly been circulating among Democrats and public employees in Wisconsin": "This indicates that there is a significant level of interest and concern among the target audience.", "More than 32": "000 people have signed an online petition opposing an alleged plan by Gov. Scott Walker to \"radically alter\" the retirement system. This demonstrates that there is a widespread belief or perception among a significant number of individuals that such a plan is being considered.", "The state teachers union is organizing a meeting specifically focused on Gov": "Walker's plan to \"seriously undermine\" retirement security. The fact that the union is actively addressing this issue suggests that they have credible information or evidence to support their concerns.", "The concerns about Gov": "Walker's plan to convert the state retirement system to a 401(k)-style plan can be traced back to early 2011 when his budget repair bill called for a study of this concept. The inclusion of this study in the budget indicates that the idea of implementing a defined contribution plan was being seriously considered by the government."}
