{"The claim was initially posted by a retired IAS officer": "Surya Pratap Singh, who shared a purported screengrab of an ABP News bulletin stating that \"Rhea Chakraborty had eaten palak paneer curry.\" This suggests that the claim originated from a credible source.", "Journalist Swati Chaturvedi also tweeted the image and criticized the Indian media for the alleged reportage": "However, she later deleted the tweet and issued a clarification, stating that the ABP News screenshot was fake. This indicates that there were doubts raised about the authenticity of the claim.", "The image itself": "when examined closely, appears to be a satirical creation and not an actual screengrab of a broadcast. The bottom-most line in the image suggests that it is a joke on the falling journalistic standards in broadcast news. This observation further questions the credibility of the claim.", "It was discovered that the screenshot was created using a meme": "generator website called \"Break Your Own News.\" This website allows users to create fake news templates by adding their own headlines, tickers, and images. The fact that the claim originated from such a platform raises doubts about its authenticity and suggests that it may have been intentionally fabricated."}
