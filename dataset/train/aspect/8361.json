{"Quotations from credible sources": "The expert's verdict mentions that Facebook user Idris Ahmed quoted Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia\u2019s former president and head of the ECOWAS mission, as well as Eva Palmans from the European Center for Electoral Support (ECES) and Maria Arena, the EU\u2019s chief observer for the election. These quotes were used to support the claim that the election was the most democratic in Nigeria's history.", "Statements from official organizations": "The expert's verdict mentions that the EU, African Union, ECES, and ECOWAS made public statements about their monitoring of the election. These statements were more restrained in their tone and did not include the same level of praise as the quotes mentioned in the claim.", "Denial of the quotes": "The expert's verdict highlights that both ECOWAS and ECES denied the quotes attributed to their representatives. ECOWAS called the words attributed to Johnson \"fake news\" and directed readers to their official preliminary declaration. ECES also referred to the posts as \"fake news\" and urged Nigerians to ignore them.", "Criticisms and shortcomings": "The expert's verdict mentions that both ECOWAS and the EU observers acknowledged shortcomings and criticisms of the election process. They mentioned logistical problems, delays, and misinformation during the campaign. While they acknowledged improvements since the last presidential vote, they also emphasized the need for more transparency and communication in future elections."}
