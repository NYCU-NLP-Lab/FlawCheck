{"Historical data limitations": "The expert notes that it is not possible to verify the claim for the past 150 years, as the state's fiscal data is only available from 1960 onwards. This limitation raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.", "Reduction in state spending": "The expert confirms that during the 2010-2011 budget cycle, there was a decrease in state spending, marking the first drop since 1960. This aspect supports the claim to some extent.", "Previous instances of spending cuts": "The expert highlights that there were multiple instances of spending cuts in Minnesota, including during Pawlenty's tenure as governor in 2009 and 2004, as well as before his term in 1986 and 1983. This information suggests that the claim of cutting spending for the first time in 150 years may not be entirely accurate.", "Temporary factors influencing spending reduction": "The expert mentions that the reduction in state spending during the 2010-2011 budget cycle was aided by temporary factors such as federal stimulus funds and postponements in spending on education. This aspect implies that the spending decrease may not have been solely due to Pawlenty's actions or policies."}
