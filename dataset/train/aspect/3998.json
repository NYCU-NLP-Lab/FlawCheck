This data was used to verify the claim made by Governor Chris Christie.", "The expert highlighted that the bulk of the private": "sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009, which coincided with the height of the recession. This information was used to counter the claim that the job losses were solely due to tax and fee hikes, regulatory changes, and state spending increases.", "The expert referenced the recession and its impact on the job market": "stating that the recession technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. This information was used to emphasize that the job losses were not solely attributable to Democratic policies but were also influenced by broader economic factors.", "The expert cited the opinion of Harry Holzer": "a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor, who deemed Christie's comparison \"extremely unfair.\" This expert opinion was employed to challenge the governor's claim and provide a different perspective on the factors contributing to the job losses in New Jersey."}
