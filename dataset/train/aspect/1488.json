{"Circulation on social media": "The claim was initially circulated on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, where multiple groups and individuals shared the photograph with captions suggesting that Rahul Gandhi was attacked in Amethi. The widespread circulation of the claim indicates its potential impact and reach.", "Verification of the photograph": "The authenticity of the photograph was examined through a reverse-search on Google, which led to an article published by Postcard News. The article carried a similar image with the Republic TV logo superimposed on it. This comparison helped establish that the viral photograph was a photoshopped version of the original image.", "Comparison with credible sources": "The original photograph used in the manipulated image was identified through a double reverse-search, which led to media organizations like Economic Times. A side-by-side comparison of both images confirmed that Republic TV had superimposed Gandhi's photograph on a background of Mount Kailash for representational purposes. This comparison with credible sources helped in verifying the authenticity of the claim.", "Analysis of image manipulation": "In addition to the comparison of images, an analysis of the manipulated photograph was conducted. It was observed that in the photoshopped image, Gandhi's face had been adjusted, his eyes were painted blue-black to portray him as injured, and his face appeared bloated. These findings further supported the conclusion that the claim of Rahul Gandhi being attacked in Amethi was false."}
