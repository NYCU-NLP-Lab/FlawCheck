{"Testimony from President Donald Trump": "The expert's verdict includes quotes from President Trump's remarks at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, where he claimed that Obamacare premiums have doubled in Wisconsin. This provides direct evidence of the claim being made.", "Statements from Wisconsin families": "President Trump was joined by two Wisconsin families who he described as victims of the Affordable Care Act. Their stories were used to support the claim that Obamacare premiums have doubled in the state. These personal testimonies add a human element to the verification process.", "Comparison to GOP plan": "The expert's verdict mentions Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Milwaukee, where he stated that under the Republican replacement for Obamacare, everyone with preexisting medical conditions would have access to coverage. This comparison between the GOP plan and Obamacare suggests that there have been significant premium increases under the latter.", "Analysis of premiums in Wisconsin": "The expert's verdict refers to a May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that compared premiums in the individual market in 2013 to 2017 in Wisconsin. The report states that the average premium nearly doubled during this period, providing statistical evidence to support the claim. However, it is also mentioned that the analysis may be skewed as it only includes policies sold in the Obamacare marketplace."}
