{"The claim is based on a statement made by President Obama during an interview with a California teen named Mota": "where he discussed the importance of politics and the role of politicians in starting colleges.", "The claim is supported by the historical context provided by the White House": "stating that the federal government's role in creating land-grant colleges began with the enactment of the Morrill Act in 1862. This act led to the establishment of over 100 land-grant colleges in all 50 states.", "The Association of Public and Land": "Grant Universities confirms that the purpose of the Morrill Act was to provide education in agriculture, military tactics, mechanic arts, and classical studies to members of the working classes.", "The claim was initially questioned and considered problematic by higher": "education historians, but the White House's explanation and evidence of the Morrill Act's impact on the establishment of colleges support the authenticity of the claim."}
