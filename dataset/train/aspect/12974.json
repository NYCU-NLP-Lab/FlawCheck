This measure takes into account cost-of-living, including taxes, housing, and medical costs, and is considered a more accurate reflection of poverty.", "Expert opinion": "The expert, Chris Hoene, executive director of the left-leaning California Budget Policy Center, supported Assemblyman Chad Mayes' comments about California's high poverty rate.
