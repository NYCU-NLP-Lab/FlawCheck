{"The documentary opens with a panorama of the ice caves in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore": "which are about 20 miles west of Bayfield. This scenic location is used to create the impression that the proposed mine is \"just up the hill\" from the caves.", "Al Jazeera correspondent Josh Rushing raises the question of whether tourists would still want to visit the area if there is an iron mine nearby": "This implies that the mine is in close proximity to the ice caves and could potentially impact tourism in the region.", "The editing of the documentary reinforces the": "just up the hill\" impression by juxtaposing footage of the ice caves with scenes of heavy equipment digging into the earth and trucks rumbling down a snow-covered road. This visual sequencing suggests a close proximity between the mine site and the caves.", "However": "Google Maps data reveals that the mine and the caves are actually more than an hour apart, with a distance of approximately 54 miles between them. This factual information contradicts the initial impression created in the documentary and raises doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
