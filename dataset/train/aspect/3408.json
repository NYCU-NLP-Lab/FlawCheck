{"The expert": "s verdict highlights the background of David Hogg as a high school student who survived a mass shooting and became an advocate for stricter gun control laws. This establishes his credibility and relevance to the claim.", "The expert dismisses various conspiracy theories and smear campaigns targeting Hogg": "such as accusations of being a crisis actor or delivering a Nazi salute. This helps establish the context of misinformation surrounding Hogg and the need for fact-checking.", "The expert mentions the spurious rumor that Hogg claimed": "generations before us don't know what it's like to be shot at by AR-15s.\" This identifies the specific claim being examined and its potential impact on Hogg's credibility.", "The expert provides evidence that contradicts the claim": "stating that Hogg never actually made the alleged statement. The mention of the earliest version of the meme, its lack of information about when and where the statement was made, and the absence of the quote in Hogg's actual remarks all contribute to debunking the claim."}
