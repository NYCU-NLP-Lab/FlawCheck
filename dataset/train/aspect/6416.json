{"The expert examined the content of the Romney ad and compared it to the actual announcement made by the U": "S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on July 12. They analyzed the claim made in the ad that under Obama's plan, individuals wouldn't have to work or train for a job and would simply receive their welfare check. The expert verified the accuracy of this claim by referencing the HHS memo and determining if it aligned with the ad's statement.", "The expert assessed the historical context and background of welfare reform in the United States": "They examined the 1996 welfare reform act signed by President Bill Clinton, which introduced work requirements for welfare recipients. The expert evaluated whether Obama's plan, as described in the claim, represented a significant departure from the existing welfare reform policies. By comparing the ad's portrayal of Obama's plan to the historical context, the expert determined the accuracy of the claim.", "The expert analyzed the language used in the HHS memo": "which outlined the department's willingness to grant waivers to states in order to test alternative strategies for improving employment outcomes for needy families. They examined the specific examples mentioned in the memo, such as collaboration with workforce and post-secondary education systems, as well as strategies for serving individuals with disabilities. The expert determined whether these examples supported the claim made in the ad that Obama's plan would eliminate work requirements entirely.", "The expert considered the broader implications and potential consequences of the HHS announcement": "They examined the potential impact of granting waivers to states and allowing them to experiment with different strategies for meeting work requirements. The expert assessed whether these potential changes could be interpreted as \"gutting\" welfare reform, as claimed in the ad. They also evaluated the likelihood of Obama's plan reverting welfare to its previous form of \"plain old welfare,\" where individuals would not have to work or train for jobs."}
