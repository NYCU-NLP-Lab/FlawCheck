{"The video footage": "The expert mentions the video posted by Wesley Scott Alexander on Facebook, which supposedly shows Black Lives Matter protesters chanting for \"dead cops.\" The video serves as evidence for the claim and is the primary source of verification.", "Timing and context": "The expert highlights the timing of the video, stating that it was posted three days after the shooting in Dallas where five officers were killed. The tension between police officers and black civilians was high during this period, making the claim more plausible.", "Historical references": "The expert provides historical references to previous instances where similar chants were recorded. They mention a video from December 2014, prior to the ambush shooting deaths of two New York City police officers. This reference suggests that such chants have occurred before and are not exclusive to the Baton Rouge incident.", "Disavowal by Black Lives Matter group": "The expert mentions that the group @MillionsMarchNYC sent a tweet disavowing the chanters depicted in the video and expressing condolences for the murdered policemen. This disavowal serves as an additional aspect to verify the claim, indicating that the chanters do not represent the official stance of the Black Lives Matter movement."}
