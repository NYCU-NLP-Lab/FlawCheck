{"Former President Jimmy Carter": "s statement: The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim is the direct statement made by Former President Jimmy Carter during his speech at the 50th anniversary observances of the March on Washington. Carter specifically mentioned that the number of African-American men in prison has increased fivefold since he left office.", "Comparison of prison population data": "The second aspect used to verify the claim is the comparison of prison population data between the time when Carter left office (January 1981) and the present. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that there were 160,442 black men in American prisons when Carter left office, and there were more than seven times as many white men as black men in the U.S. at that time. By comparing this data with the current statistics, it can be determined whether the claim of a fivefold increase in the number of African-American men in prison is accurate.", "Census figures on the increase in the number of black men": "The third aspect employed to verify the claim is the examination of U.S. Census figures that show the increase in the number of black men in the United States between 1980 and 2010. These figures indicate that the number of black men increased by more than 45 percent during this period, from 12.5 million to 18.2 million. This data can help determine whether there has been a significant increase in the population of African-American men, which could potentially support the claim.", "Confirmation from expert opinion": "The fourth aspect used to verify the claim is the confirmation from Ivory Toldson, an associate professor at Howard University, who cited numbers supporting Carter's claim during an interview with NPR. Toldson referred to a table from a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which likely provides further evidence to support the claim made by Carter. The expert's opinion and reference to specific data sources add credibility to the claim."}
