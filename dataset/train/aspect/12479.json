{"Border apprehension figures": "The expert's verdict mentions that the governor's claim was supported by U.S. Border Patrol figures for apprehensions across California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. These figures showed that overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they've been in nearly 50 years. This aspect provides statistical evidence to verify the authenticity of the claim.", "Comparison with previous years": "The expert's verdict highlights the comparison between apprehension figures in 2017 and previous years. It states that the number of arrests in 2017 (303,916) was significantly lower than the previous low of 263,991 in 1971. This aspect further supports the claim by showing a long-term trend of decreasing apprehensions.", "Distribution of apprehensions": "The expert's verdict mentions that 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California. It provides a breakdown of the distribution, stating that about 68 percent of the arrests took place in Texas and New Mexico, while Arizona accounted for 17 percent and California about 15 percent. This aspect emphasizes that the majority of apprehensions are happening in other states, supporting the claim that there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California.", "Expert opinion": "The expert's verdict includes a statement from Ev Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego, who agrees with the governor's claim. Meade states that even though apprehensions are at an historic low borderwide, they are particularly low in California. This aspect adds credibility to the claim by providing an expert opinion that aligns with the governor's statement."}
