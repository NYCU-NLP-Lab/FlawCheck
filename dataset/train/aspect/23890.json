{"The dramatic drop in illegal border crossings in San Diego": "measured by border patrol apprehensions, was a key aspect used to verify the authenticity of the claim. Border patrol arrests in the San Diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630,000 in 1986 to 26,000 in 2017.", "The decrease in illegal entries across the entire Southern border": "not just in San Diego, for nearly two decades was another aspect considered. Illegal entries dropped from more than 1.5 million in 2000 to less than 500,000 in 2018.", "The presence of other factors contributing to the reduction in illegal crossings was also taken into account": "These factors include expanded job opportunities in Mexico and increased technology and staffing by the federal government.", "The construction of a triple": "layer fence, doubling of border patrol agents, and deployment of underground sensors in the San Diego sector were additional aspects that played a role in reducing illegal crossings. The presence of completed tunnels under the San Diego border was also mentioned as a potential factor skewing the number of illegal crossings."}
