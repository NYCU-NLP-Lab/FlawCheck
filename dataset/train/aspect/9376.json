{"Rothstein": "s desire for connections to power: The expert's verdict mentions that Rothstein wanted connections to power at all levels, including investing in the county sheriff's race, holding fundraisers for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid, and supporting Crist's campaigns for governor and U.S. Senate. This suggests that Rothstein had a motive to contribute to Crist's campaigns, but it does not necessarily prove that he had control over judicial appointments.", "Lack of hard evidence": "The expert's verdict states that there is a lack of hard evidence to support the claim that Rothstein actually controlled Crist's judicial appointments. Members who served on the judicial nominating commission with Rothstein stated that they did not see him taint the process or push hard for specific nominees.", "Testimony from JNC members": "PolitiFact Florida interviewed six members who served on the JNC with Rothstein, including Democrats and Republicans. These members stated that they did not witness Rothstein doing anything to taint the judicial appointments process or actively pushing for specific nominees."}
