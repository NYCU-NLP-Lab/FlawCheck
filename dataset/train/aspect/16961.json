{"The first aspect employed to verify the authenticity of the claim was the investigation into the source of the screenshot that appeared to be from a CNN article": "It was determined that the article was fake and that CNN never ran such a story. Additionally, there was no record of any scientific study matching the description contained in the screenshot.", "The second aspect involved examining the imagery featured in the screenshot": "It was discovered that the illustration showing the \"safe area for injection\" into a penis was taken from an instruction manual for penile self-injection as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. This indicated that the image was unrelated to the claim and further discredited its authenticity.", "Another aspect involved reaching out to the doctor shown in the fake CNN article": "Mohitkumar Ardeshana. He confirmed that the article was completely fake and stated that he had not made any statements regarding such a study. His testimony provided evidence that the claim was a work of mischief by someone.", "The final aspect focused on analyzing the second screenshot": "which appeared to be the opening page of a study presented as being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, upon closer examination, it was found that the title of the article and the content of the \"Background\" and \"Results\" sections were nonsensical and unrelated to any legitimate scientific study. This further undermined the credibility of the claim."}
