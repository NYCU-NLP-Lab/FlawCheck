It was found that both photos were taken in previous years and showed earlier waves of xenophobic violence, not the recent events.", "Comparison with credible sources": "The expert compared the photos used in the claim with credible sources such as AFP and Reuters. It was found that one photo was taken by AFP's chief Africa photographer in 2015, while the other photo was taken by a Reuters photographer in 2017. These photos did show xenophobic violence but were not recent.", "Untraceable origins of other photos": "The expert mentions that the origins of the other two images used in the claim were not traced.
