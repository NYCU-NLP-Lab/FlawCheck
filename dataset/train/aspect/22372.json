{"The original tweet by Zarah Sultana": "which depicted a woman carrying a tote bag with Arabic writing and a humorous translation, serves as the initial claim.", "The translation of the Arabic writing on the tote bag": "which was transcribed by an Arabic speaker and then put through Google Translate, provides a rough English interpretation of the text.", "The contact information provided by Zarah Sultana for the company behind the Arabic totes": "Israel-based Rock Paper Scissors Printshop, allows for further verification and potential communication with the company.", "The statement from Rock Paper Scissors Printshop": "explaining the intention behind their designs and their desire to preserve the presence of the Arabic language in public spaces, adds credibility to the claim."}
