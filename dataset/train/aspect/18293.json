{"Identification of the location": "The expert's investigation involved identifying the location shown in the video as Pydhonie, a neighborhood in South Mumbai. This was confirmed by the presence of a signboard for 'Dr Shaista's Wellness Clinic' in the video.", "Testimony from a local resident": "The expert interviewed Mohammad Umer, who runs a garment store near the clinic, and he confirmed that the building shown in the video is called Ismail and a film shoot had taken place there on February 14. This testimony provided evidence that the video was not related to a terrorist arrest but rather a film shoot.", "Confirmation from a police constable": "Pydhonie police constable Sunil Pendkar stated that the video does not show a terrorist attack but a film shoot. He further confirmed that the men and cars shown in the video do not belong to the Mumbai police. This statement from a law enforcement officer added credibility to the conclusion that the video was not authentic.", "Input from a Facebook user": "Yaseen Qureshi Jadid Inquilab, a Facebook user, suggested that the video shows a shooting of a 'Crime Patrol' episode, a Hindi crime series. While the exact production house involved was not known, this input supported the notion that the video was not depicting a real terrorist arrest."}
