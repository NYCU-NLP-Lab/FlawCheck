{"Media coverage": "The expert examined the amount of media coverage received by Alexander Snitker compared to other prominent candidates in the U.S. Senate race. They found that Snitker had very limited media mentions, with only two mentions in the Orlando Sentinel's \"What's happening\" column and eight mentions on the St. Petersburg Times political blog.", "Nexis search": "The expert conducted a Nexis search in the category of \"Florida News Sources\" to gather information on media references to Snitker. This search yielded only two mentions in the past three months, further supporting the claim that Snitker was being ignored by the major media.", "Comparison with other candidates": "The expert compared the media coverage received by Snitker with that of the three more prominent contenders in the Senate race: Charlie Crist, Marco Rubio, and Kendrick Meek. They found that Snitker had a significant disadvantage, with Rubio receiving 861 mentions, Meek receiving 286 mentions, and Crist receiving 2,292 mentions.", "Campaign efforts": "The expert also considered the campaign's own efforts to gain media attention. They noted that the Snitker for Senate 2010 campaign sent periodic e-mail blasts to hundreds of reporters and media members across the state, but none of these efforts resulted in published articles or follow-up from TV stations. This suggests that the lack of media coverage was not due to a lack of effort on the part of the campaign."}
