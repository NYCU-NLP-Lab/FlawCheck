{"New Jersey": "s credit rating is an expert analysis of the state's ability to meet its debt obligations, similar to a regular person's credit score. The downgrades reflect concerns about the state's financial management and ability to repay its debts.", "The first credit": "rating downgrade of Christie's governorship occurred in February 2011, and it was mentioned by Standard & Poor's that the downgrade was due to long-running problems with the state's pension and health care obligations, as well as a slow economic recovery.", "The claim made by Greta Van Susteren that New Jersey had": "seven credit downgrades\" since Christie became governor is technically accurate, but it gives the impression that the state's credit rating itself was downgraded by seven places, which is not the case."}
