{"Comparison with existing task forces": "The expert's verdict highlights that there are already task forces in Cleveland and Toledo that have been active for years, indicating that the claim of the Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force being the first of its kind in Central Ohio is not accurate.", "Historical efforts and studies": "The expert's verdict mentions that previous attorneys general and elected officials have studied the issue of human trafficking and called for tougher laws, suggesting that there have been ongoing efforts to address the problem in Central Ohio.", "Collaboration with other law enforcement agencies": "The expert's verdict states that law enforcement agencies in Central Ohio have long investigated human trafficking, often in collaboration with federal officials. This indicates that there have been coordinated efforts to combat human trafficking in the region, even if they were not officially called a task force.", "Task force composition": "The expert's verdict mentions that the Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force includes officials from various agencies, such as the Columbus police, the attorney general's investigative unit, a suburban Columbus police department, the FBI, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
