{"The claim that": "hello\" entered the language because it was the surname of Alexander Graham Bell's girlfriend was debunked as a hoax by the expert.", "The online presence of this claim was first observed in November 2010": "and it has since evolved with different versions, including renaming Alexander Graham Bell as \"Graham Bell\" or \"graham-bell.\"", "Historical evidence shows that Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876 and made the first successful call to his assistant": "not to a girlfriend named Margaret Hello.", "The etymology of": "hello\" traces it back to its origins as an alteration of shouts used to attract attention, dating back to at least 1400. It was not used as a greeting until around twenty years before Bell was born, with the earliest known print usage dating to 1827."}
