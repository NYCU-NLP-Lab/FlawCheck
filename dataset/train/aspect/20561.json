{"Comparison to historical minimum wage": "The expert compared the current minimum wage to the minimum wage during Harry Truman's presidency to verify the claim. They used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the inflation-adjusted wage and found that in 1950, the minimum wage was higher than today's minimum wage.", "Inflation adjustment": "The expert used the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator to adjust the minimum wage from Truman's time to its equivalent value in 2013 dollars. This allowed for a fair comparison between the two time periods.", "Analysis of multiple years": "The expert analyzed the minimum wage during all eight years of Truman's presidency, not just a single year. They found that during seven out of the eight years, the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was lower than it is today, providing evidence against the claim.", "Expert consensus": "The expert cited the agreement of economists, such as Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution, who supported the analysis and stated that the current minimum wage's purchasing power is below any year of the Truman administration, even if the difference is only two cents per hour. This consensus adds credibility to the verification process."}
