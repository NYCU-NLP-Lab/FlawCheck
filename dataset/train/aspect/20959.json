{"The source of the claim": "The expert identified that the claim was published on the now-defunct Newshound website, which was known for reproducing hoaxes and spoofs as real news. This raised suspicions about the credibility of the claim.", "Inconsistencies in the story": "The expert pointed out that the photograph of the SOS message supposedly created by the stranded woman was actually a cropped and enlarged version of a picture published by Amnesty International in a different context. This inconsistency suggested that the story might be fabricated.", "Plagiarism of text": "The expert highlighted that portions of the Newshound story were directly lifted from a 2013 Daily Mail article about a different person's survival experience on a remote island. This plagiarism indicated that the claim might be a fabrication or a misrepresentation of someone else's story.", "Lack of corroborating evidence": "The expert noted that there was no additional evidence or supporting documentation provided to verify the claim. The absence of any other sources or testimonies to confirm the woman's existence or her rescue through Google Earth raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim."}
