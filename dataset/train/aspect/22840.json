{"The expert referred to the government": "s definition of small businesses, which includes businesses with up to 1,500 employees or gross income of up to $38.5 million. This definition helps clarify the scope of small businesses that would potentially be affected by the claim.", "The expert mentioned the current top tax rate of 39": "6 percent, along with the additional 3.8 percent that could be paid in Medicare taxes, resulting in a total tax rate of 43.4 percent. This provides context for the current tax burden on small businesses.", "The expert highlighted that Clinton": "s proposed 4 percent surcharge on high earners would bring the total tax rate to 47.4 percent, which is where the claim of \"almost 50 percent\" comes from. This demonstrates how the claim is based on the specific tax proposal put forth by Clinton.", "The expert referred to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center": "which supports the claim that the 4 percent surcharge would apply to virtually any small business with substantial income, regardless of industry. This adds credibility to the claim by providing an independent analysis of the potential impact on small businesses."}
