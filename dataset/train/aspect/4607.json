{"Misrepresentation of statistics": "The expert's verdict highlights that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren misstated a racial disparity statistic. They wrongly claimed that \"after 20 years, only 5% of whites have student debt, but 95% of African Americans have debt.\" However, the actual statistic from the 2019 Brandeis University study showed that 51% of white student-loan holders and 74% of Black student borrowers still had debt 20 years after starting college.", "Inaccurate impact on wealth gap": "Warren inaccurately stated that their debt cancellation plan would help close the Black-white wealth gap by 28 points for African Americans and a similar number for Latinos. The expert's verdict clarifies that another 2019 analysis from Brandeis researchers found that the reduction in racial wealth gaps among borrowing households would be about that much, not the overall wealth gaps for all households.", "Introduction of a resolution": "Schumer and Warren, along with other Democratic representatives, reintroduced a bicameral resolution urging President Joe Biden to use his executive authority to address student loan debt. This aspect highlights the political action taken by the lawmakers to address the issue.", "Previous legislation and research": "The expert's verdict mentions that Warren and Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn had introduced the Student Loan Debt Relief Act in July 2019, but it did not receive a vote. Additionally, it references a study released by Brandeis University's Institute on Assets and Social Policy in September 2019, which found that 49% of white and 26% of Black student-loan borrowers had paid off their loans after 20 years."}
