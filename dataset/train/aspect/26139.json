{"The misleading and confusing information presented in the article": "including quotes taken out of context and mischaracterized, was a key aspect that was employed to verify the authenticity of the claim. The article misrepresented the role and credibility of the supposed Pfizer vice president, Dr. Peter Rost, who was actually a vice president of marketing for Pfizer and was fired in 2005 after a public dispute with the company over drug pricing.", "Another aspect that helped verify the inauthenticity of the claim was the fact that Gardasil": "the vaccine in question, is not manufactured by Pfizer but by Merck. It is unclear why a Pfizer executive would blow the whistle on a product that their company does not even produce.", "The contradiction within the article itself": "where the headline claims the vaccine is \"deadly\" but the content of the article does not directly support this claim, was also a significant aspect that cast doubt on the authenticity of the claim. The article relied on a video clip featuring Dr. Rost discussing vaccines in general, rather than specifically addressing the safety or dangers of Gardasil.", "Lastly": "the inclusion of quotes from unrelated medical publishing professionals who were not discussing vaccines or their efficacy further undermined the credibility of the claim. These quotes were taken out of context and did not provide any direct evidence or support for the claim that Gardasil is \"deadly.\""}
