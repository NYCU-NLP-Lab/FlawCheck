{"Cooper": "s plan only covers community college: The expert's verdict highlights that the claim made by McCrory's administration, stating that Cooper won't say how he will pay for 'free' college tuition, is misleading. Cooper's plan specifically mentions offering free tuition for community college, not four-year colleges or advanced degree programs.", "Expansion of existing program": "The expert's analysis reveals that while free community college tuition is already partially in place for certain high school students with a B average, Cooper's proposal aims to expand the availability of free tuition to everyone. This means that although it would benefit a significant number of people, it is not as extensive as McCrory implied.", "Limited scope and cost": "The expert's verdict highlights that offering free tuition for community college in North Carolina would still have a significant financial impact. The state's community college system is the third largest in the country, and providing free tuition to all students would cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars annually.", "Lack of information on payment plan": "While the expert's analysis addresses the specifics of Cooper's proposal, it does not provide explicit information on how the plan will be funded. Therefore, it is unclear from the provided information whether Cooper has presented a detailed payment plan for the proposed free community college tuition."}
